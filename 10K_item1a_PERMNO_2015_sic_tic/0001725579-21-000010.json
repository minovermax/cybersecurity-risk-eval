{"cik": "1725579", "company": "Pluralsight, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nSummary of Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk because our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, as described below. The principal factors and uncertainties that make investing in our Class A common stock risky include, among others:\n\u2022We face risks relating to the proposed Mergers with Vista.\n\u2022If our business customers do not expand their use of our platform beyond their current organizational engagements or renew their existing contracts with us, our ability to grow our business and improve our results of operations may be adversely affected.\n\u2022Failure to effectively expand our sales and marketing capabilities could harm our ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our platform.\n\u2022If we do not expand our course library effectively or develop new platform features that respond to constantly evolving technologies and the needs of our customers, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\u2022If we are unable to mitigate the risks associated with serving our business customers, while increasing sales of our platform subscriptions to these customers, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could suffer.\n\u2022Market adoption of cloud-based learning solutions is new and unproven and may not grow as we expect, which may harm our business and results of operations, and even if market demand increases, the demand for our platform may not increase.\n\u2022The market in which we participate is competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our results of operations could be harmed.\n\u2022Our future performance partly depends on attracting and retaining authors and producing content that addresses our customers\u2019 needs.\n\u2022Our quarterly and annual results of operations may be difficult to predict because they may vary significantly, and if we fail to meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts, our stock price could decline.\n\u2022The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has affected and may continue to materially adversely affect our stock price, business operations, and overall financial performance.\n\u2022Our principal asset is our interest in Pluralsight Holdings, and we are dependent upon Pluralsight Holdings and its consolidated subsidiaries for our results of operations, cash flows, and distributions, since we have no means to independently generate them.\n\u2022Our ability to pay taxes and expenses, including payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, or TRA, may be limited by our structure.\n\u2022We will be required to pay the TRA Members for certain tax benefits we may claim, and we expect that the payments we will be required to make will be substantial.\n\u2022The multi-class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with Aaron Skonnard, our co-founder, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman; which limits or precludes your influence as a stockholder on corporate matters and may have a negative impact on the price of our Class A common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has affected and may continue to materially adversely affect our stock price, business operations, and overall financial performance.\nSince December 2019, when COVID-19 was first reported in China, it has spread globally and the WHO declared it as a pandemic in March 2020. This pandemic has and may continue to adversely affect worldwide economic activity, business operations, and financial markets. The duration and magnitude of the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our stock price, business operations, and overall financial performance is unknown at this time and will depend on certain developments, some of which are uncertain and not within our control, including the span and spread of the outbreak; the severity and transmission rate of the virus and emergence of new strains; the measures implemented or suggested by governing bodies, such as cities, counties, states, countries, and the WHO, to slow the spread of COVID-19 (for example, the closure of businesses deemed \u201cnon-essential;\u201d social distancing; international border closures; and travel restrictions); the extent and effectiveness of containment actions, including vaccines and their distribution; the effect on our vendors, customers, and community; the global economy and political conditions; the impact of changes to domestic and foreign legislative and tax policy in response to the COVID-19 pandemic; the health of our employees, contractors, and their families; the duration of the global COVID-19-driven recession; the rate at which vaccines are distributed and administered broadly; how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating activities can resume; and other factors that are not predictable. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue experiencing adverse effects to our business as a result of its global economic impact, including the global recession . If we are not able to sufficiently manage and effectively respond to the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, our business will be harmed.\nSince March 2020 we have taken precautionary measures and made operational modifications to protect our employees, contractors, and their families, including: converting customer events, such as Pluralsight LIVE, to virtual-only experiences; temporarily closing our offices and implementing a mandatory worldwide work-from-home policy; limiting all employee travel; reducing discretionary spending; and limiting the hiring of additional personnel. In addition, we may deem it advisable to alter, postpone, convert to virtual-only or cancel entirely future in-person customer, employee, or industry events. Such restrictions may hinder our ability to interact with our prospective and existing customers in-person and host conferences and events in-person, which has and may continue to impact sales of our products and services, decrease customer satisfaction and the effectiveness of our support activities, extend sales cycles and increase attrition rates. We actively monitor COVID-19-related developments and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by local, state or federal authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our personnel, customers, vendors and stockholders. The extent these measures will negatively affect our sales and marketing efforts, sales cycles, personnel productivity, or customer retention, any of which could harm our financial performance and business operations, is indeterminable at this time.\nTechnology spending by our customers or prospective customers has been and may continue to be impacted by conditions presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, including the global recession. These conditions have caused and may continue to cause them to reduce or delay their purchasing decisions, limit their ability to purchase our offerings, reduce their ability to provide payment under existing contracts, prolong payment periods, decrease our customer retention, or delay our ability to provision our products and services, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations, future sales, and overall financial performance. For example, we experienced a decrease in our dollar-based net retention rate during 2020, in part due to the impact of COVID-19, and because we calculate that metric on a twelve-month trailing period, we expect that the impact of COVID-19 on our business in 2020 may also effect our dollar-based net retention rate in future quarters.\nThe conditions presented by the COVID-19 pandemic may affect provisioning of goods and services by our suppliers and vendors, including Amazon Web Services and internet service providers. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic could cause some of our third-party providers to shut down their business, experience security incidents that impact our business, delay performance or delivery of goods and services, or experience interference with the supply chain of hardware required by their systems and services, any of which could materially adversely affect our business. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in more personnel working from home and conducting\nwork via the internet and if the network and infrastructure of internet providers becomes overburdened by increased usage or is otherwise unreliable or unavailable, our personnel\u2019s access to the internet to conduct business could be negatively impacted. Limitations on access or disruptions to services or goods provided by or to some of our suppliers and vendors upon which our platform and business operations relies, could interrupt our ability to provide our offerings, decrease the productivity of our workforce, and significantly harm our business operations, financial performance and results of operations.\nMoreover, the increase in remote working may also result in privacy, data protection, data security, and fraud risks, and our understanding of applicable legal and regulatory requirements, as well as the latest guidance from regulatory authorities in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic may be subject to legal or regulatory challenge. Our platform and the other systems or networks used in our business have experienced and may continue experiencing an increase in attempted cyber-attacks, targeted intrusion, ransomware, and phishing campaigns seeking to take advantage of shifts to personnel working remotely using their household or personal internet networks and leverage fears promulgated by the COVID-19 pandemic. We may incur increased expenses to limit these risks. The success of any of these unauthorized attempts could substantially impact our platform, the proprietary and other confidential data contained therein or otherwise stored or processed in our operations, and ultimately on our business. Any actual or perceived security incident also may cause us to incur increased expenses to improve our security controls and to remediate security vulnerabilities. Although we retain errors and omissions insurance coverage for certain security and privacy damages and claim expenses, this coverage may be insufficient to compensate us for all liabilities that we may incur as a result of any actual or potential security breach, and we cannot be certain that insurance coverage will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that an insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. One or more claims that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition, operating results, and reputation.\nIn the event a significant number of our employees, authors, or members of our key personnel become unavailable due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our business could be harmed, employee morale and cohesion could suffer, and our financial performance could be materially negatively impacted. Further, preservation of our company culture, efforts to collaborate, and the productivity of personnel could be compromised by the physical distance and lack of in-person interaction created by social distancing, travel restrictions, our global work-from-home mandate, and other measures responsive to the COVID-19 pandemic, which could harm our business.\nIn the event financial markets worsen from impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, investments in some financial instruments may pose risks arising from credit and market liquidity concerns. The long-term effects to the global securities markets of pandemics and other public health crises, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, are difficult to estimate or predict. Concerns regarding the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused extreme volatility in financial and other capital markets throughout the world, which may have a material adverse impact on our stock price. Further, such volatility in the global capital markets could increase the cost of capital and could adversely impact our access to capital.\nThe global COVID-19 outbreak and its long-term impacts on our business are not fully ascertainable at this time and difficult to predict. If our plans to ensure our business functions continue to operate effectively during and after this pandemic are unsuccessful or inadequate, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and stock price could be harmed. Further, to the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, results of operations, or financial condition, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nMarket adoption of cloud-based learning solutions is new and unproven and may not grow as we expect, which may harm our business and results of operations, and even if market demand increases, the demand for our platform may not increase.\nWe believe our future success depends in part on the growth, if any, in the demand for cloud-based technology learning solutions, particularly enterprise-grade solutions. The widespread adoption of our platform depends not only on strong demand for new forms of technology learning, but also for solutions delivered via a Software-as-a-\nService, or SaaS, business model in particular. The market for cloud-based learning solutions is less mature than the market for in-person instructor-led training, or ILT, which many businesses currently utilize, and these businesses may be slow or unwilling to migrate from these legacy approaches. As such, it is difficult to predict customer demand for our platform, customer adoption and renewal, the rate at which existing customers expand their engagement with our platform, the size and growth rate of the market for our platform, the entry of competitive products into the market, or the success of existing competitive products. Furthermore, even if businesses want to adopt a cloud-based technology learning solution, it may take them a long time to fully transition to this type of learning solution or they could be delayed due to budget constraints, weakening economic conditions, or other factors. Some businesses may also have long-term contracts with existing vendors and cannot switch to our platform in the short term. Even if market demand for cloud-based technology learning solutions generally increases, we cannot assure you that adoption of our platform will also increase. If the market for cloud-based technology learning solutions does not grow as we expect or demand for our platform does not increase, it could result in reduced customer spending, customer attrition, and decreased revenue, any of which would adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIf we do not expand our course library effectively or develop new platform features that respond to constantly evolving technologies and the needs of our customers, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe market for talent in technology-related fields is growing and constantly evolving due to the continuously changing needs of our customers. Moreover, software is displacing manual processes throughout businesses in many industries and, as a result, the talent that companies seek to hire and retain must keep pace with technological change and drive digital transformation. As such, our future success depends on ensuring our business customers\u2019 employees can master the latest emerging technologies and improve their skills in existing areas by developing and making available on a timely basis new and improved learning content and platform features that can address evolving customer needs. With respect to content creation, since new technologies are constantly introduced, our success depends upon our ability to identify technological developments and predict which technology will become widely adopted or strategically important, and then develop course content and related skill and role assessments to address these areas in a timely manner, which we may not do successfully. For example, certain courses we developed in the past received lower than anticipated levels of customer interest and we did not generate sufficient revenue from those courses to offset their costs. In addition, if we do not anticipate our customers\u2019 demands and provide courses in topics that address these demands, our lead times for course production may make it difficult for us to rapidly produce the desired content. With respect to platform features, many of the features we currently offer are relatively new and unproven and we cannot assure you that our existing features and any future features or enhancements we develop will be utilized. The success of any course library expansion or new or enhanced feature depends on several factors, including our understanding of market demand, timely execution, successful introduction, and market acceptance. We may fail to develop new content and features or enhance our existing platform to meet customer needs or our new content and features and enhancements may not achieve adequate acceptance in the market. Additionally, we may not sufficiently increase our revenue to offset the upfront technology and content, sales and marketing, and other expenses we incur in connection with the development of new courses, platform features and enhancements. Any of the foregoing may adversely affect our business and results of operations, reduce market acceptance of our platform, and diminish customer retention and satisfaction.\nThe market in which we participate is competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our results of operations could be harmed.\nThe market for professional skill development, including technology skills and engineering analytics, is highly competitive, rapidly evolving, and fragmented, and we expect competition to continue increasing and intensifying in the future. A significant number of companies developed, or are developing, products and services that compete or will compete with our offerings. There are relatively modest barriers to entry in our industry, as well as low switching costs relative to the broader enterprise software sector. The discretionary nature of our services creates significant volatility based on changes in customer budgets and timing, and we are highly susceptible to changes in market conditions. In addition, the emergence of new, highly capitalized competition and free or ad-supported offerings (e.g., leveraging YouTube, GitHub and similar platforms) has accelerated and intensified competitive pressures. This competition has in the past resulted in, and could in the future result in, decreased billings and\nrevenue growth, increased pricing pressure, increased sales and marketing expenses and other customer acquisition costs, higher churn, lower retention and loss of market share, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe face competition from consumer-centric SaaS solutions, legacy enterprise SaaS solutions, in-person ILT, and free solutions. We compete directly or indirectly with:\n\u2022ILT vendors, such as Global Knowledge, General Assembly, and New Horizons;\n\u2022legacy e-learning services, such as Skillsoft and O\u2019Reilly;\n\u2022certification and training courses, such as A Cloud Guru and CBT Nuggets;\n\u2022individual-focused e-learning services, such as LinkedIn Learning, Udemy, and Udacity;\n\u2022engineering analytics tools, such as Code Climate, Waydev, and BlueOptima; and\n\u2022free solutions, such as YouTube.\nMany of our competitors and potential competitors are larger and have greater brand name recognition, longer operating histories, larger marketing budgets, more established customer relationships, access to larger customer bases, and significantly greater resources for the development of their solutions. In addition, some of our competitors have consolidated, and continued consolidation among them may subject us to increased and intensified competitive pressures that may harm our results of operations. Further, we face potential competition from participants in adjacent markets that may enter our markets by leveraging related technologies and partnering with or acquiring other companies or providing alternative approaches to provide similar results. We may face competition from companies entering our market, including some of the largest technology companies in the world, that could expand their offerings or acquire one of our competitors. While these companies may not currently focus on our market, they may have significantly greater financial resources and longer operating histories than we do. As a result, our competitors and potential competitors may respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, or customer requirements. Further, some potential customers, particularly large enterprises, may elect to develop their own internal solutions that address their technology skill needs.\nOur ability to compete is subject to the risk of future disruptive technologies. If new technologies emerge delivering skill development solutions at lower prices, with greater feature sets, more efficiently, or more conveniently, such technologies could adversely impact our ability to compete. With the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect competition to continue accelerating and intensifying in the future.\nSome of our principal competitors offer solutions at a lower price or for free, which may result in pricing pressures on us. Many of our competitors offering free solutions are also integrating features found previously only with paid solutions, which layers additional pressure on our pricing and feature development. If we do not maintain our pricing levels and competitive differentiation in the market, our results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nIf we are unable to mitigate the risks associated with serving our business customers, while increasing sales of our platform subscriptions to these customers, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could suffer.\nOur growth strategy is largely dependent upon increasing sales of our platform subscriptions to business customers. As we seek to increase sales to business customers, we face upfront sales costs and longer sales cycles, higher customer acquisition costs, more complex customer requirements, and volume discount requirements that we do not typically face with sales to individuals.\nWe often enter into customized contractual arrangements with our business customers, particularly large enterprises, in which we offer more favorable pricing terms in exchange for larger total contract values that accompany large deployments. As we drive a greater portion of our revenue through our deployments with business customers, we expect our revenue to continue growing significantly, but the price we charge business customers per user may decline. This may result in reduced margins in the future if our cost of revenue increases. Sales to business\ncustomers involve risks that may not be present, or are present to a lesser extent, with sales to individuals. For example, business customers may request we integrate our platform with their existing technologies, and these customization efforts could create additional costs and delays in utilization. In addition, business customers often begin using our platform on a limited basis, but nevertheless require education and interactions with our sales team, which increases our upfront investment in the sales effort with no guarantee that these customers will use our platform widely enough across their organization to justify our upfront investment. As we continue expanding our sales efforts to business customers, we need to continue increasing the investments we make in sales and marketing, and there is no guarantee that our investments will succeed and contribute to additional customer acquisition and revenue growth. If we do not increase sales to business customers while mitigating the risks associated with serving such customers, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may suffer.\nFailure to effectively expand our sales and marketing capabilities could harm our ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our platform.\nOur ability to broaden our customer base, particularly our business customer base, and achieve broader market acceptance of our platform predominately depends on the ability of our sales and marketing organizations to expand our sales pipeline and cultivate customer and partner relationships to drive revenue growth. We invested in and plan to continue expanding our sales and marketing organizations, both domestically and internationally. Competitive pressures may require us to further increase our sales and marketing spend. Identifying, recruiting, and training sales personnel requires significant time, expense, and attention. We have made changes to our sales senior leadership team in the past, and future changes could disrupt our operations due to logistical and administrative inefficiencies, increase costs, and result in us losing personnel with deep institutional knowledge, all of which could significantly impact our operations.\nWe also plan to continue dedicating significant resources to sales and marketing programs, including lead generation activities and brand awareness campaigns, such as search engine and email marketing, online banner and video advertising, user events such as our annual user conference, Pluralsight LIVE, and webinars. If we do not hire, develop, and retain talented sales or marketing personnel, if our new sales or marketing personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time, if our sales and marketing programs are not effective, or if we are not able to successfully integrate new senior leadership to our sales organization, our ability to broaden our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our platform could be harmed. In addition, the investments we make in our sales and marketing organization will occur in advance of experiencing benefits from such investments, making it difficult to determine in a timely manner if we are efficiently allocating our resources in these areas.\nIf our business customers do not expand their use of our platform beyond their current organizational engagements or renew their existing contracts with us, our ability to grow our business and improve our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur future success partly depends on increased adoption of our platform by our existing customers and future customers. Many of our business customers initially use our platform in specific groups or departments within their organization, or for a specific use case. Growth of our business depends in part on customers\u2019 expanded use of our platform to address additional use cases. Further, to continue growing our business, it is important our customers renew their subscriptions when existing contracts expire and we expand our relationships with our existing customers. Our customers have no obligation to renew their subscriptions, and our customers may decide not to renew their subscriptions with a similar contract period, at the same prices and terms, with the same or a greater number of users, or at all. In the past, some of our customers elected not to renew their agreements with us, and it is difficult to accurately predict whether we will continue successfully retaining customers or expanding our relationships with them. We experienced significant growth in the number of users of our platform, but it is unknown whether we will sustain similar user growth in the future. Retention of our business customers and expansion of our deployments with them may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including our customers\u2019 satisfaction with our platform, our customer support, our prices, the prices and features of competing solutions, reductions in our customers\u2019 spending levels, insufficient user adoption of our platform, and new feature releases, or the lack thereof. If our business customers do not purchase additional subscriptions or renew their\nexisting subscriptions, renew on less favorable terms, or fail to continue expanding their engagement with our platform, our revenue may decline or grow less quickly than anticipated, which could harm our results of operations.\nOur future performance partly depends on attracting and retaining authors and producing content that addresses our customers\u2019 needs.\nThe majority of our content is created by subject-matter experts, or authors, who are generally not our employees. This presents certain risks to our business, including, among others:\n\u2022we may not be able to remain competitive in finding and retaining authors;\n\u2022we generally have exclusivity with our authors with respect to the specific subject matter of the courses they create for us, but they may produce content for competitors or on their own with respect to related topics and other subjects;\n\u2022our existing authors, particularly our most popular authors, may not continue creating content for us;\n\u2022the topics of content created by our authors may not address the needs of our customers;\n\u2022the content created by our authors may not meet the quality standards that our customers expect and demand, or effectively differentiate our content from that of our competitors with respect to content quality and breadth;\n\u2022the fees that we pay our authors may cease to be competitive with the market for their talent; and\n\u2022most of our content authors assign us all right and title to the course content, however certain content authors license us the right to use the course content on a non-exclusive basis, which means that those authors could license the same course content to one of our competitors.\nIf any of the risks above occur, customers may seek other solutions for their professional skill development needs and we may not retain them or acquire additional customers to offset any such departures, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, our most popular authors are a relatively small group of individuals who created course content that has historically represented a significant portion of the total course hours viewed. The loss of our authors, particularly our most popular authors, and our inability to replace them with new author relationships of comparable quality and standing, could significantly impact our business and operating results and limit our ability to produce content of a quality or at a scale sufficient to grow our business.\nOur quarterly and annual results of operations may be difficult to predict because they may vary significantly, and if we fail to meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts, our stock price and the value of your investment could decline.\nOur quarterly and annual billings, revenue and results of operations fluctuated significantly in the past and may vary significantly in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. Our financial results in any one quarter should not be relied upon as indicative of future performance. We may not be able to accurately predict our future billings, revenue or results of operations. Factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations include, but are not limited to, those listed below:\n\u2022fluctuations in the demand for our platform and the timing of sales, particularly larger subscriptions;\n\u2022our ability to attract new customers or retain existing customers;\n\u2022our existing authors, particularly our most popular authors, may not continue creating content for us;\n\u2022the content created by our authors may not address the needs of our customers and may not meet the standards that our customers expect and demand;\n\u2022changes in customer renewal rates and our ability to increase sales to our existing customers;\n\u2022our ability to anticipate or respond to changes in the competitive landscape, including consolidation among competitors;\n\u2022an increase in the length of sales cycle as a higher percentage of our billings come from larger business customers;\n\u2022our customers\u2019 seasonal buying patterns;\n\u2022our customers\u2019 budgeting cycles and internal purchasing priorities;\n\u2022the payment terms and subscription term length associated with our platform sales and their effect on our billings and free cash flow;\n\u2022the timing of expenses and recognition of revenue;\n\u2022the amount and timing of operating expenses related to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations, and infrastructure;\n\u2022the timing and success of new product feature and service introductions by us or our competitors;\n\u2022network outages;\n\u2022changes in laws and regulations that impact our business; and\n\u2022general economic and market conditions, including as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIf our billings, revenue or results of operations fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts in a particular quarter, or below any guidance we provide, the price of our Class A common stock could decline.\nIf we fail to retain and recruit key employees or qualified technical and sales personnel, our business could be harmed.\nWe believe our success depends on the continued employment of our senior management and other key employees. We also rely on our leadership team in the areas of technology, content, marketing, sales, services and general and administrative functions. Challenges attracting and recruiting key senior personnel upon the departure of an executive team member, implementation of any team member reorganization coinciding with such departure, training and onboarding any newly hired employees, and the impacts of the executive team member\u2019s departure on employee morale, could have a serious adverse effect on our business.\nOur future success depends on our ability to continue enhancing and introducing new content and platform features, which makes attracting and retaining qualified personnel with the requisite education, background, and industry experience crucial. As we expand our business globally, our continued success will also depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified sales, marketing, and operational personnel capable of supporting a larger and more diverse worldwide customer base. The current market environment is highly competitive for such talent. The loss of a significant number of our technology, content or sales personnel and their services could be disruptive to our development efforts or customer relationships. In addition, if any of our key employees joins a competitor or decides to otherwise compete with us, we may experience a material disruption of our operations and business strategy, which may cause us to lose customers or increase operating expenses and may divert our attention as we seek to recruit replacements for the departed employees.\nIf we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business and results of operations could be harmed.\nWe experienced, and may continue experiencing, rapid growth and organizational change, which placed, and may continue placing, significant demands on our management and our operational and financial resources. For example, our full-time employee headcount has grown from approximately 1,100 employees as of December 31, 2018 to approximately 1,700 employees as of December 31, 2020, of which, over 1,400 are located in the United States. We operate globally, sell subscriptions to customers in more than 180 countries, and have employees in various locations in the United States, Europe, and the Asia Pacific region. We plan to continue expanding our\noperations into other countries in the future, which will place additional demands on our resources and operations. Simultaneously, we continue increasing the breadth and scope of our platform and our operations. To support this growth, and to manage any future growth effectively, we must continuously and efficiently improve our IT and financial infrastructures, operating and administrative systems, and management of our headcount, capital, and internal processes. Our organizational structure is becoming more complex as we grow our operational, financial, and management infrastructure and we must continuously enhance our internal controls, reporting systems and procedures. We intend to continue expanding our business by investing in technology, content, sales and marketing operations, hiring additional personnel, improving our internal controls, reporting systems and procedures, and upgrading our infrastructure. These investments will require significant capital expenditures and the allocation of management resources, and any investments we make will occur in advance of experiencing the benefits from such investments, making it difficult to determine in a timely manner if we are efficiently allocating our resources. If we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments, or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur rapid growth and limited history with our cloud-based technology skills platform make it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and may increase the risk that we will not continue growing at or near historical rates.\nWe grew rapidly over the last several years, and as a result, forecasting our future results of operations is subject to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to effectively plan for and model future growth. Although we began operations in 2004, we shifted our business model in 2011 from offering in-person ILT to an entirely online delivery model. Beginning in 2011, we extended our offering to include new content areas and additional features, which enabled us to expand our addressable market, attract new users, and broaden our relationships with businesses. This limited history with our SaaS model and cloud-based platform offering further limits forecasting of our future results of operations. As such, any predictions about our future revenue and expenses may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history with our delivery model or platform or operated in a more predictable market. We encountered in the past, and may encounter in the future, risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan and operate our business, are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks adequately, our results of operations could differ materially from our expectations, our growth rates may slow, and our business may suffer.\nWe recognize revenue from subscriptions over the term of our customer contracts, and as such our reported revenue and billings may differ significantly in a given period, and our revenue in any period may not be indicative of our financial health and future performance.\nWe generally recognize revenue from subscriptions ratably over the subscription term of the underlying customer contract, which is generally one year. Our billings are recorded upon invoicing for access to our platform, thus a significant portion of the billings we report in each quarter are generated from customer agreements entered into and invoiced during the period. As a result, much of the revenue we report each quarter is derived from contracts that we entered into with customers in prior periods. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any quarter will not be fully reflected in revenue or other results of operations in that quarter. Rather, it will negatively affect our revenue and other results of operations across future quarters, making it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue from additional billings in a given period. Any increases in the average term of subscriptions would result in revenue for those contracts being recognized over longer periods of time with less positive impact on our results of operations in the near term. Accordingly, our revenue in any given period may not be an accurate indicator of our financial health and future performance.\nAs we continue expanding our sales efforts to larger business customers, our sales cycles may lengthen and grow in complexity, which may cause our billings and revenue to vary substantially and become difficult to predict and cause our results of operations to fluctuate significantly.\nOur results of operations may fluctuate, in part, because of the resource-intensive nature of our sales efforts to larger businesses, from which we derive a significant portion of our billings and revenue, the length and variability of our sales cycle, and difficulty in adjusting our operating expenses in the short term. The length of our sales cycle, from identification of the opportunity to delivery of access to our platform, varies significantly from customer to\ncustomer, with sales to larger businesses typically taking longer to complete. In addition, as we continue increasing our sales to larger businesses, we face longer, more complex customer requirements and substantial upfront sales costs. With larger businesses, the decision to subscribe to our platform frequently requires the approvals of multiple management personnel and more technical personnel than would be typical of a smaller organization and, accordingly, sales to larger businesses may require us to invest more time educating these potential customers. Moreover, sales to larger businesses tend to require more complex and sophisticated procurement negotiations which increase the length and cost to acquiring larger businesses. Purchases by larger businesses are also frequently subject to budget constraints and unplanned administrative, processing, and other delays, which may impede our efforts to reach agreement on the terms of the sale to larger businesses.\nTo the extent our competitors develop products that our prospective customers view as equivalent or superior to our platform, our average sales cycle may increase. Additionally, if a key sales member leaves our employment or if our primary point of contact at a customer or a potential customer leaves their employment, our sales cycle may be further extended or customer opportunities may be lost. As a result of the buying behavior of enterprises and the efforts of our sales force and partners to meet or exceed their sales objectives by the end of each fiscal quarter, we historically received and generated a substantial portion of billings during the last month of each fiscal quarter, often the last two weeks of the quarter. These transactions may not close as expected or may be delayed in closing. The unpredictability of the timing of customer purchases, particularly large purchases, could cause our billings and revenue to vary from period to period or to fall below expected levels for a given period, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe believe our long-term success partly depends on continued expansion of our sales and operations outside of the United States, which subjects us to a number of risks associated with international sales and operations.\nWe currently maintain offices and employ sales personnel outside the United States in Europe, Australia, and the Asia Pacific region, and we intend to continue expanding our international operations. In order to maintain and expand our sales internationally, we may need to relocate, hire and train experienced personnel to staff and manage our foreign operations. To the extent we experience difficulties in recruiting, training, managing, and retaining international staff, and specifically sales and marketing personnel, we may experience difficulties in growing our international sales and operations.\nAdditionally, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022unexpected costs and errors in tailoring our products for individual markets, including translation into foreign languages and adaptation for local practices;\n\u2022difficulties in adapting to customer desires due to language and cultural differences;\n\u2022increased expenses associated with international sales and operations, including establishing and maintaining office space and equipment for our international operations;\n\u2022lack of familiarity and burdens of complying with foreign laws, legal standards, regulatory requirements, tariffs, and other barriers;\n\u2022greater difficulty in enforcing contracts and accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods;\n\u2022practical difficulties of enforcing intellectual property rights in countries with fluctuating laws and standards and reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u2022theft of intellectual property, data and technology through intrusion by foreign actors, those affiliated with or controlled by state actors, and private parties;\n\u2022unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, taxes, trade laws, tariffs, trade wars or potential changes in trade relations arising from policy initiatives implemented by the current U.S. presidential administration, export quotas, custom duties, or other trade restrictions;\n\u2022limitations on technology infrastructure, which could inhibit our migration of international operations to our existing systems and result in increased costs;\n\u2022difficulties in managing and staffing international operations and differing employer/employee relationships and local employment laws;\n\u2022challenges in complying with local data privacy and data protection requirements and protecting the security of our platform;\n\u2022challenges obtaining work permits and visas, and navigating immigration laws and systems among jurisdictions; and\n\u2022potentially adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added tax (or other tax) systems and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings.\nAdditionally, operating in international markets requires significant management attention and financial resources. Our personnel have limited experience in marketing, selling, and supporting our platform abroad, which increases the risk of any potential future expansion efforts undertaken by us being unsuccessful. We plan to invest substantial time and resources toward expanding our international operations, but we cannot be certain that these investments will produce desired levels of revenue or profitability. These factors among others could harm our ability to gain future international revenue and materially affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we fail to develop, maintain, and enhance our brand and reputation cost-effectively, our business and financial condition may be adversely impacted.\nWe believe that developing, maintaining, and enhancing awareness and integrity of our brand and reputation in a cost-effective manner are important to achieving widespread acceptance of our platform and are important elements in retaining existing customers and attracting new customers. We believe the importance of our brand and reputation will increase as competition in our market further intensifies. Successful promotion of our brand will depend on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts, our ability to provide a reliable and useful platform at competitive prices, the perceived value of our platform, and our provisioning of quality customer support. However, brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue, and even if they do, the increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incur in building and maintaining our brand and reputation. If we fail to promote and manage our brand successfully, cultivate loyalty among our customers, or incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and grow our brand awareness and strength, we may fail to retain our existing customers and partners, or attract new customers and partners, and our business and financial condition may be adversely affected. Any negative publicity relating to our employees, partners, or other parties associated with us or them, may tarnish our reputation simply by association and may reduce the value of our brand. Damage to our brand and reputation may result in reduced demand for our platform and increased risk of losing market share to our competitors. Any efforts to restore the value of our brand and rebuild our reputation may be costly and unsuccessful.\nIf we cannot maintain our company culture as we grow, we could lose the innovation, teamwork, passion, and focus on execution that we believe contribute to our success and our business may be harmed.\nWe believe a critical component to our success is our company culture. Our company is aligned behind our culture and key values, and we have invested substantial time and resources in building our team within this company culture. As we grow and develop the infrastructure of a public company, we may find it difficult to sustain these important aspects of our company culture worldwide. If we fail to preserve and nurture our culture, our retainment and recruitment of personnel, ability to effectively focus on and pursue our corporate objectives, and business could be harmed.\nWe are engaged in legal proceedings that could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses and occupy a significant amount of our management\u2019s time and attention.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to litigation or claims, including securities class actions and shareholder derivative lawsuits, which are typically expensive to defend. Resolving, disputing and litigating legal claims could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses and occupy a significant amount of management\u2019s time and attention, which could negatively affect our business operations and financial condition. For example, a class action complaint was filed in August 2019 by a stockholder in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against us and some of our officers alleging violation of securities laws and seeking unspecified damages. The action was transferred to the U.S. District Court for the District of Utah in October 2019 and in March 2020, a lead plaintiff was appointed. An amended complaint was filed on June 3, 2020. The amended complaint names us as defendants, along with certain of our officers, members of our Board of Directors, and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, the lead underwriters from our March 2019 common stock offering.\nWe believe this lawsuit is without merit and intend to defend the case vigorously. We are unable to estimate a range of loss, if any, that could result were there to be an adverse final decision. If an unfavorable outcome were to occur in this case, it is possible that the impact could be material to our results of operations in the period(s) in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable. While we have insurance for this class action and other types of claims, there is no assurance that our available insurance will be sufficient to cover these claims. For more information, please see Note 12 to our financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAny failure to offer high-quality customer support may harm our relationships with our customers and results of operations.\nOur customers depend on our customer support teams to resolve technical and operational issues if and when they arise. We may not respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for customer support. Customer demand for support may increase as we expand the features available on our platform. Increased customer demand for customer support, without corresponding revenue, could increase costs and harm our results of operations. As we continue expanding our business customer base, we need to continue providing efficient and effective customer support that meets our business customers\u2019 needs and expectations globally at scale. The number of our business customers grew significantly, which puts additional pressure on our support organization. In order to meet these needs, we relied in the past, and will continue relying on, self-service customer support to resolve common or frequently asked questions, which supplement our customer support teams. If we are unable to provide efficient and effective customer support globally at scale, including through the use of self-service support, the growth of our operations may be harmed and we may need to hire additional support personnel, which could negatively impact our margins and results of operations. Our sales are highly dependent on our business reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing customers. Any failure to maintain high-quality customer support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality customer support, could adversely affect our business, reputation, sales of our platform to existing and prospective customers, results of operations, and financial condition.\nRecent and future acquisitions of other companies or technologies could divert our management\u2019s attention, result in additional dilution to our stockholders, and otherwise disrupt our operations and harm our results of operations.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have in the past and may in the future seek to acquire or invest in businesses, people, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our platform, enhance our content library or otherwise offer growth opportunities. For example, in October 2020 we announced the acquisition of DevelopIntelligence and in January 2021 we announced the acquisition of Next Tech. We have completed eleven acquisition transactions for an aggregate cost of approximately $425 million in the last eight years, which pace is expected to accelerate in the coming years. The pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses in identifying, investigating, and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not they are ultimately consummated.\nAny integration process may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and require significant time and resources and, although we have been successful in the past, we may not be able to integrate the acquired personnel, operations, and technologies successfully or effectively manage the combined business in connection with any future acquisition.\nWe may not achieve the anticipated benefits from an acquired business due to a number of factors, such as:\n\u2022costs or liabilities associated with the acquisition;\n\u2022diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022inability to integrate or benefit from acquired content, technologies, or services in a profitable manner;\n\u2022harm to our existing relationships with authors and customers as a result of the acquisition;\n\u2022difficulty integrating the accounting systems, operations, and personnel of the acquired business;\n\u2022difficulty converting the customers of the acquired business onto our platform and contract terms;\n\u2022the potential loss of key employees;\n\u2022use of resources that are needed in other parts of our business; and\n\u2022the use of substantial portions of our available cash or equity to consummate the acquisition.\nOur ongoing need for acquisition transactions introduces execution risk to identify, consummate and integrate target companies. If our past or future acquisitions do not yield expected returns, we may be required to take charges for the write-down or impairment of amounts related to goodwill, intangible assets, and our content library, which could negatively impact our results of operations. We may issue additional equity securities in connection with any future acquisitions, which could dilute our existing stockholders, use cash that we may need in the future to operate our business, incur debt on terms unfavorable to us or that we are unable to pay, incur large charges or substantial liabilities, and become subject to adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation, or deferred compensation charges. These challenges could adversely affect our business, financial conditions, results of operations, and prospects.\nWe might require additional capital to support our growth and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.\nWe intend to continue investing in our growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new features, enhance our existing platform or acquire complementary businesses, technologies, and content. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. In addition, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, supporting our growth and responding to business challenges could be significantly impaired.\nOur management team has limited experience managing a public company.\nMost members of our management team have limited experience managing a publicly-traded company, interacting with public company investors, and complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies. Our management team may not successfully or efficiently manage issues related to our status as a public company that are subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under the federal securities laws and the continuous scrutiny of securities analysts and investors. These obligations and constituents require\nsignificant attention from our senior management and could divert their attention away from the day-to-day management of our business, which could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Privacy, Data Protection, Cybersecurity and Intellectual Property\nIf our security measures are breached or data is otherwise subject to unauthorized access, use or disclosure, our platform may be perceived as insecure, we may lose existing customers or fail to attract new customers, our reputation may be harmed, and we may incur significant liabilities.\nUnauthorized access to or use of, or other security breaches of our platform or the other systems or networks used in our business, including those of our vendors, contractors, or those with which we have strategic relationships, or unauthorized access to or use, disclosure or acquisition of our proprietary or confidential data, or personal, proprietary or other confidential data of our employees, vendors, customers, users or others could result in the loss, compromise or corruption of data or intellectual property, loss of business, reputational damage adversely affecting customer or investor confidence, regulatory investigations and orders, litigation, indemnity obligations, damages for contract breach, penalties for violation of applicable laws or regulations, significant costs for remediation and other measures taken in connection with the breach, and other liabilities. Security is one of the main course subjects we provide on our platform, which may cause our platform to be a target for hackers and others, and which causes our brand, credibility, and reputation to be particularly sensitive to actual or perceived security breaches.\nOur platform, and the other facilities, systems or networks used in our business, including those of our third-party vendors, are at risk for security breaches as a result of cyber attacks, software vulnerabilities or coding errors, hackers, physical break-ins, computer viruses, inadequate security controls by customers, employees, contractors or vendors such as, weak or recycled passwords, worms or other malicious software programs or other third-party action, or employee, vendor, or contractor error or malfeasance. We have invested, and will continue investing, as needed significant expenses to prevent security breaches, including deploying dedicated personnel and protection technologies, training employees, and engaging third-party experts and consultants. However, since the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, deny authorized access, or otherwise sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until after they are launched against a target, we and our third-party vendors may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. We and our third parties may also experience security breaches that remain undetected for an extended period and result in a substantial impact on our platform, the proprietary and other confidential data contained therein or otherwise stored or processed in our operations, and ultimately on our business. Any actual or perceived security incident also may cause us to incur increased expenses to improve our security controls and to remediate security vulnerabilities. Although we retain errors and omissions insurance coverage for certain security and privacy damages and claim expenses, this coverage may be insufficient to compensate us for all liabilities that we may incur as a result of any actual or potential security breach, and we cannot be certain that insurance coverage will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that an insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. One or more claims that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition, operating results, and reputation.\nFailure or perceived failure to comply with applicable and evolving foreign or domestic privacy and information security regulations could limit the use and adoption of our platform, expose us to increased liability, and harm our business and reputation.\nPrivacy, information security, and data protection are issues of growing concern and the regulatory framework governing the collection, processing, storage, transfer and use of information is rapidly evolving in various jurisdictions where we do business. Many governments have adopted and continue proposing requirements regarding personally identifiable information and other data relating to individuals. Federal and state consumer protection laws are being applied to enforce regulations related to the online collection, use, and dissemination of data.\nSome foreign countries and governmental bodies in regions where we conduct business, including the European Union, or EU, have laws and regulations that often are more restrictive and more broadly applicable than those in the United States. With regard to the transfer of personal data from our European employees and customers to the United States, we historically have relied upon self-certification under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and under the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield (collectively, the \u201cPrivacy Shield Frameworks\u201d). In certain cases, we agreed to standard contract clauses approved by the European Commission, or the SCCs. On July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union, or CJEU, issued a decision invalidating the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and imposing additional obligations on companies when relying on the SCCs. Additionally, the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner has stated that it no longer considers the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield adequate for purposes of transfers of personal data from Switzerland to the U.S. This CJEU decision and related circumstances may result in European data protection regulators applying differing standards for, and requiring additional measures to be taken with respect to, transfers of personal data from the EU and Switzerland to the U.S. The CJEU\u2019s decision and related developments may require us and our customers to take additional steps to legitimize any personal data transfers impacted by this CJEU decision, increasing costs of compliance and limitations on our customers and us. We continue to monitor and review the impact of any resulting changes to laws in Europe that could affect our operations.\nVariations in required protections and approaches among jurisdictions may result in reluctance or refusal by European customers to use our platform due to potential risk exposure created by transferring personal data from Europe to the United States, and we and our customers may face enforcement actions by European data protection authorities regarding data transfers from Europe to the United States.\nProposed and newly enacted laws, regulations, and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection, and information security continue emerging and evolving globally, including the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679, or the GDPR, adopted in the EU, which took full effect in May 2018, and the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, adopted in California, which became operative on January 1, 2020. The GDPR provides for substantial penalties and other remedies, including giving EU regulators the ability to issue fines up to the greater of \u20ac20 million or 4% of worldwide annual turnover. The California Attorney General can enforce the CCPA, including seeking injunctive relief and civil penalties for violations. The CCPA also provides a private right of action for certain data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. Many aspects of the CCPA and its interpretation remain uncertain. Additionally, the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, was approved by California voters in the November 3, 2020 election. The CPRA modifies the CCPA significantly, creating obligations relating to consumer data beginning on January 1, 2022, with implementing regulations expected on or before July 1, 2022, and enforcement beginning July 1, 2023. The CPRA is creating further uncertainty and may require us to incur additional costs and expenses in an effort to comply. We cannot fully predict the impact of the CCPA or the CPRA on our business or operations, but they may require us to modify our data practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply. Some observers have noted that the CCPA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States, which could increase our potential liability and adversely affect our business.\nFurther, the United Kingdom, or UK, ceased to be an EU Member State on January 31, 2020, subject to a transitional period that ended December 31, 2020, but has enacted legislation substantially implementing the GDPR and the European Commission and the United Kingdom government announced a EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement on December 24, 2020, providing for a temporary free flow of personal data between the EU and the UK, but it remains to be seen how the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU will impact the manner in which United Kingdom data protection laws or regulations will develop and how data transfers to and from the UK will be regulated and enforced by the UK Information Commissions\u2019 Office, EU data protection authorities, or other regulatory bodies in the longer term. As a result of the UK\u2019s exit from the EU, we could be required to make changes to the way we conduct business and transmit data between the United States, the UK, the EU, and other jurisdictions. In addition, some countries are considering or have enacted legislation requiring local storage and processing of data that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services. We cannot yet determine the impact evolving and future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business. Laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection and information security are often subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent, creating complexity in how we do business.\nThese uncertain circumstances, new and evolving laws, and other requirements could reduce demand for our platform, increase our costs, impair our ability to grow our business, affect our ability to respond to customer requests to access, correct and delete personal information under these laws, restrict our ability to store and process data or, in some cases, impact our ability to offer our platform in some locations and may subject us to liability. Further, we may find it necessary or beneficial to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or to expend significant resources to modify our platform and otherwise adapt to these changes. If we are not able to make such changes and modifications in a commercially reasonable manner, or at all, our ability to develop new content and features could be limited.\nAny failure or perceived failure to comply with applicable privacy, security or data protection laws and regulations, and any follow-up or remedial actions required by such laws or regulations or related to an actual or alleged violation of such laws and regulations, including requirements to notify individuals whose personal information was affected by a security breach, may result in regulatory investigations and proceedings, lawsuits, consent decrees, and injunctions, negatively impact our reputation, cause us to incur significant costs, liabilities and expenses, including legal expenses and substantial fines and penalties, harm customer confidence, hurt our expansion into new markets, reduce demand for our platform, lead to the loss of existing customers and adversely affect our financial condition.\nIf we do not keep pace with technological developments, our business may be harmed.\nOur platform is designed to operate on a variety of network, hardware, and software platforms using internet tools and protocols, which requires us to continuously modify and enhance our platform to keep pace with changes in internet-related hardware, software, communication, browser, and database technologies. If we fail to respond in a timely and cost-effective manner to these rapid technological developments, our platform may become obsolete, which could adversely impact our results of operations. For example, if we fail to ensure our video courses are fully enabled and readily available on multiple platforms, such as computers, tablets and other mobile devices, our business may be harmed.\nIf we fail to adequately protect our proprietary rights, our competitive position could be impaired and we may lose valuable assets, generate less revenue or experience slower growth rates, and incur costly litigation to protect our rights.\nThe skill development industry is characterized by a large number of copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights. Our success is partly dependent upon protecting our proprietary information and technology. We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, intellectual property assignment agreements, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, and employee invention assignment agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may be inadequate. We will not be able to protect our intellectual property if we are unable to enforce our rights or if we do not detect and mitigate unauthorized use of our intellectual property. Despite our precautions, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our platform and use information that we regard as proprietary to create solutions that compete with ours. In addition, we experienced, and may in the future be subject to, piracy of our course content. In the past, individuals illegally accessed our course materials and posted them online, and individual users within our business customers obtained access to our content outside the scope of the customer\u2019s subscription, which caused us to lose potential revenue opportunities, and such activities may recur in the future. Policing piracy of our content and unauthorized use of our platform is difficult and the steps we take to combat such actions may prove ineffective. Some license provisions protecting against unauthorized use, copying, transfer, and disclosure of our platform may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions and foreign countries. Further, the laws of some countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights in some foreign countries may be insufficient to protect our rights. To the extent we expand our international activities, our exposure to unauthorized copying and use of our platform and proprietary information may increase. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our technology and intellectual property.\nWe rely, in part, on trade secrets, proprietary know-how, and other confidential information to maintain our competitive position. Although we enter into intellectual property assignment agreements or license agreements with\nour authors, confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants, and confidentiality agreements with the parties with whom we have strategic relationships and business alliances, no assurance can be given that these agreements will be effective in controlling access to, and distribution of, our platform and proprietary information. Further, these agreements do not prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our platform.\nTo protect our intellectual property rights, we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect these rights. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights and to protect our trade secrets. Such litigation could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims, and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Unsuccessfully protecting our proprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use, and any costly litigation or diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, could delay further sales or the implementation of our platform, impair the functionality of our platform, delay introductions of new platform features, result in our substituting inferior or more costly technologies into our platform, or injure our reputation. In addition, we may be required to license additional technology from third parties to develop and market new platform features or services, and we cannot guarantee we will be able to license that technology on commercially reasonable terms or at all, and our inability to license this technology could weaken our competitive abilities.\nWe may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights.\nOur success depends in part upon our not infringing the intellectual property rights of others. However, our competitors, as well as a number of other entities and individuals, may own or claim to own intellectual property relating to our industry or, in some cases, our technology or content. We obtain much of our content from third-party authors. Although we enter into agreements with our authors in which they represent that their content is not infringing the intellectual property rights of others, such content could be infringing and consequently subject us to liability. Moreover, we have in the past and may in the future leverage open source software in our development processes. Open source software is generally licensed by its authors or other third parties under open source licenses. These licenses may subject us to certain unfavorable conditions or obligations, including that we make publicly available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon, incorporating or using the open source software, or that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open source license.\nIn the past, third parties claimed we infringed their intellectual property rights. Such claims may reoccur in the future, and we may actually be found to be infringing on such rights. Additionally, if a third-party software provider incorporated open source software into software we license from such provider, we may be required to disclose any of our source code that incorporates or is a modification of any such licensed software. Any claims or litigation related to open source software or to alleged infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties could cause us to incur significant expenses, and if successfully asserted against us, could require we pay substantial damages or ongoing revenue share payments, indemnify our customers or distributors, obtain licenses, modify products, or refund fees, any of which could deplete our resources and adversely impact our business.\nReal or perceived errors, failures, vulnerabilities, or bugs in our platform could harm our business and results of operations.\nErrors, failures, vulnerabilities, or bugs may occur in our platform, especially when updates are deployed or new features are rolled out. In addition, utilization of our platform in complicated, large-scale customer environments may expose previously unknown errors, failures, vulnerabilities, or bugs in our platform. Any such errors, failures, vulnerabilities, or bugs may not be found until after they are deployed to our customers. As a provider of technology learning solutions, our brand and reputation is particularly sensitive to such errors, failures, vulnerabilities, or bugs. Real or perceived errors, failures, vulnerabilities, or bugs in our platform could result in negative publicity, loss of competitive position, loss or corruption of customer data, loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products, or claims by customers for losses sustained by them, all of which could harm our business and results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Dependence on Third Parties\nIf we fail to manage our hosting network infrastructure capacity, our existing customers may experience service outages and our new customers may experience delays in accessing our platform.\nWe host our platform on data centers provided by Amazon Web Services, or AWS, a provider of cloud infrastructure services. Our operations depend on the virtual cloud infrastructure hosted in AWS and the information stored in these virtual data centers that third-party internet service providers transmit. Although we have disaster recovery plans that utilize multiple AWS locations, any incident affecting their infrastructure that may be caused by fire, flood, severe storm, earthquake, power loss, telecommunications failures, unauthorized intrusion, computer viruses, disabling devices, natural disasters, war, criminal act, military actions, terrorist attacks, and other similar events beyond our control could negatively affect the availability and reliability of our platform. A prolonged AWS service disruption affecting our platform and the ability of our users to access our products, such as our video courses, for any of the foregoing reasons could damage our reputation with current and potential customers, expose us to liability, cause us to lose customers, or otherwise harm our business. We may also incur significant costs associated with using alternative equipment or taking other actions in preparation for, or in reaction to, events that damage or impair the AWS services we use.\nAWS enables us to order and reserve server capacity in varying amounts and sizes distributed across multiple regions, and provides us with computing and storage capacity pursuant to an agreement that continues until terminated by either party. AWS may terminate the agreement by providing 30 days prior written notice and may, in some cases, terminate the agreement immediately for cause upon notice. Any disruption of our use of, or interference with, AWS could materially adversely affect our operations and business.\nWe experienced significant growth in the number of users, transactions, and data that our hosting infrastructure supports. We strive to maintain sufficient excess capacity in our hosting network infrastructure to meet the needs of all of our customers and our growing content library. However, the provision of new hosting infrastructure requires significant lead time. If we do not accurately predict our infrastructure capacity requirements, our existing clients may experience service outages that may adversely impact our results of operations and lead to customer losses. If our hosting infrastructure capacity fails to keep pace with increased sales and customer usage, customers may experience delays as we seek to obtain additional capacity, which could harm our reputation and adversely affect our revenue growth.\nWe rely upon SaaS technologies from third parties to operate our business, and interruptions or performance problems with these technologies may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe rely on hosted SaaS applications from third parties in order to operate critical functions of our business, including content delivery, enterprise resource planning, customer relationship management, billing, project management, and accounting and financial reporting. If these services become unavailable due to extended outages, interruptions, or because they are no longer available on commercially reasonable terms, our expenses could increase, our ability to manage finances could be interrupted, and our processes for managing sales of our platform and supporting our customers could be impaired until equivalent services, if available, are identified, obtained, and implemented, all of which may negatively impact our results of operations, our relationships with our customers, and harm our business.\nOur business could be adversely impacted by changes in internet access for our users.\nOur platform depends on the quality of our users\u2019 access to the internet. Certain features of our platform, including the display of our video courses, require significant bandwidth and fidelity to work effectively. Internet access is frequently provided by companies having significant market power that could take actions to degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user access to our platform, which could negatively impact our business. We could\nincur greater operating expenses and our efforts to acquire and retain customers could be negatively impacted if network operators:\n\u2022implement usage-based pricing;\n\u2022discount pricing for competitive products;\n\u2022otherwise materially change their pricing rates or schemes;\n\u2022charge us to deliver our traffic at certain levels or at all;\n\u2022throttle traffic based on its source or type;\n\u2022implement bandwidth caps or other usage restrictions; or\n\u2022otherwise monetize or control access to their networks.\nAs the internet continues to experience growth in the number of users, frequency of use, and amount of data transmitted, the internet infrastructure we and our users rely on may no longer support the demands placed upon it. The failure of the internet infrastructure that we or our users rely on, even for a short period of time, could undermine our operations and harm our results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Foreign Operations and Regulations\nWe believe our long-term success partly depends on continued expansion of our sales and operations outside of the United States, which subjects us to a number of risks associated with international sales and operations.\nWe currently maintain offices and employ sales personnel outside the United States in Europe, Australia, and the Asia Pacific region, and we intend to continue expanding our international operations. In order to maintain and expand our sales internationally, we may need to relocate, hire and train experienced personnel to staff and manage our foreign operations. To the extent we experience difficulties in recruiting, training, managing, and retaining international staff, and specifically sales and marketing personnel, we may experience difficulties in growing our international sales and operations.\nAdditionally, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022unexpected costs and errors in tailoring our products for individual markets, including translation into foreign languages and adaptation for local practices;\n\u2022difficulties in adapting to customer desires due to language and cultural differences;\n\u2022increased expenses associated with international sales and operations, including establishing and maintaining office space and equipment for our international operations;\n\u2022lack of familiarity and burdens of complying with foreign laws, legal standards, regulatory requirements, tariffs, and other barriers;\n\u2022greater difficulty in enforcing contracts and accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods;\n\u2022practical difficulties of enforcing intellectual property rights in countries with fluctuating laws and standards and reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u2022theft of intellectual property, data and technology through intrusion by foreign actors, those affiliated with or controlled by state actors, and private parties;\n\u2022unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, taxes, trade laws, tariffs, trade wars or potential changes in trade relations arising from policy initiatives implemented by the current U.S. presidential administration, export quotas, custom duties, or other trade restrictions;\n\u2022limitations on technology infrastructure, which could inhibit our migration of international operations to our existing systems and result in increased costs;\n\u2022difficulties in managing and staffing international operations and differing employer/employee relationships and local employment laws;\n\u2022challenges in complying with local data privacy and data protection requirements and protecting the security of our platform;\n\u2022challenges obtaining work permits and visas, and navigating immigration laws and systems among jurisdictions; and\n\u2022potentially adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added tax (or other tax) systems and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings\nAdditionally, operating in international markets requires significant management attention and financial resources. Our personnel have limited experience in marketing, selling, and supporting our platform abroad, which increases the risk of any potential future expansion efforts undertaken by us being unsuccessful. We plan to invest substantial time and resources toward expanding our international operations, but we cannot be certain that these investments will produce desired levels of revenue or profitability. These factors among other could harm our ability to gain future international revenue and materially affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may face exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nToday, substantially all of our customer contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars, while our operating expenses outside of the United States are often denominated in local currencies. As we expand our international operations, a larger portion of our operating expenses will be denominated in local currencies. Currently, we do not engage in currency hedging activities to limit the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. Therefore, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may affect our results of operations when translated into U.S. dollars. In the future, we may use derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. Moreover, the use of hedging instruments may introduce additional risks if we are unable to structure effective hedges with such instruments.\nOur business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws that could give rise to claims, increase the cost of operations, or otherwise harm our business due to changes in the laws and their interpretations, greater enforcement of the laws, or investigations into compliance with the laws.\nOur business is subject to regulation by various federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies, including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing copyright laws, employment and labor laws, workplace safety, consumer protection laws, privacy and data protection laws, anti-bribery laws, import and export controls, federal securities laws, and tax laws and regulations. In certain foreign jurisdictions, these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than those in the United States. These laws and regulations are subject to change over time and we must continuously monitor and dedicate resources to ensure ongoing compliance. Non-compliance with applicable laws or regulations could subject us to investigations, sanctions, enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, fines, damages, civil and criminal penalties, or injunctions. If any governmental sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, responding to any action would likely result in a significant diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees. Enforcement actions and sanctions could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe are also subject to consumer protection laws that may impact our sales and marketing efforts, including laws related to subscriptions, billing, and auto-renewal. These laws, as well as any changes in these laws, could make it more difficult for us to retain existing customers and attract new ones.\nWe are subject to governmental export and import controls and anti-corruption laws and regulations that could impair our ability to compete in international markets and subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws.\nOur business activities are subject to various restrictions under U.S. export and similar laws and regulations, including the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Export Administration Regulations and various economic and trade sanctions administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Controls. The U.S. export control laws and U.S. economic sanctions laws include restrictions or prohibitions on the sale or supply of certain products and services to U.S. embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments, persons and entities. In addition, various countries regulate the import of certain technology and have enacted or could enact laws that limit provisioning our customers access to our platform or limit our customers\u2019 access or use of our services in those countries. Further, the current U.S. presidential administration has been critical of existing trade agreements and may impose more stringent export and import controls.\nAlthough we take precautions to prevent our platform from being provided in violation of such laws, our platform could be provided inadvertently in violation of such laws. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we and some of our employees could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, including the loss of export privileges and fines. We also may be adversely affected through penalties, reputational harm, loss of access to certain markets, or otherwise. In addition, various countries regulate the import and export of certain encryption and other technology, including import and export permitting and licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our platform or our users\u2019 ability to access our platform in those countries. Changes in our platform, or future changes in export and import regulations may prevent our users with international operations from utilizing our platform globally or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our platform to certain countries, governments, or persons altogether. Any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions, or related legislation, increased export and import controls stemming from the current U.S. presidential administration\u2019s policies, or change in the countries, governments, persons, or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our platform by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell subscriptions to our platform to, existing or potential users with international operations. Any decreased use of our platform or limitation on our ability to export or sell our platform could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial results.\nWe are subject to various domestic and international anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, and the U.K. Bribery Act, and other similar anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws and regulations. Anti-bribery laws have been enforced aggressively in recent years and are interpreted broadly to generally prohibit companies, their employees, agents, representatives, business partners, and third-party intermediaries from authorizing, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to recipients in the public or private sector. Under these laws, we may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of our employees, agents, representatives, business partners or third-party intermediaries even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. Although we take precautions to prevent violations of these laws, we cannot assure you that all of our employees and agents will not take actions in violation of applicable law and our exposure for violating these laws increases as our international presence expands and as we increase sales and operations in foreign jurisdictions.\nAny allegations or violation of the FCPA or other applicable anti-bribery laws could result in whistleblower complaints, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, enforcement actions, fines, damages, adverse media coverage, investigations, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions, or suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracts, all of which may have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations, and prospects. Responding to any investigation or action will likely result in a materially significant diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees.\nOur international operations subject us to potentially adverse tax consequences.\nWe are subject to income taxes and non-income-based taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, property and goods and services taxes, in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to jurisdictional rules regarding the timing and allocation of revenue and\nexpenses. Additionally, the amount of income taxes paid is subject to our interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we file and to changes in relevant tax laws. Significant judgment is required to determine our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. From time to time, we may be subject to income and non-income tax audits. While we believe we have complied with all applicable income tax laws, there can be no assurance that a governing tax authority will not interpret the law differently and assess us with additional taxes. Should we be assessed with additional taxes, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur future effective tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws, regulations, rates, our international organization, and overall levels of income before tax, changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, and the impact of accounting for equity-based compensation and accounting for business combinations. In the ordinary course of our global business, there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, we cannot ensure that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals.\nRisks Related to Our Legal and Regulatory Environment\nOur business could be affected by new governmental regulations regarding the internet.\nVarious laws and regulations could impede the growth of the internet or other online services, and new laws and regulations may be adopted in the future. These laws and regulations could limit internet neutrality, involve taxation, tariffs, privacy, data protection, information security, content, copyrights, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, consumer protection, and the characteristics and quality of services, any of which could decrease the demand for, or the usage of, our platform. To date, government regulations have not materially restricted use of the internet in most parts of the world. However, the legal and regulatory environment pertaining to the internet is uncertain and governments may impose regulation in the future. New laws may be passed, courts may issue decisions affecting the internet, existing but previously inapplicable or unenforced laws may be deemed to apply to the internet, regulatory agencies may begin to more rigorously enforce such formerly unenforced laws, or existing legal safe harbors may be narrowed, both by U.S. federal or state governments or by governments of foreign jurisdictions.\nThe adoption of any new laws or regulations, or the narrowing of any safe harbors, could hinder growth in the use of the internet and online services generally, and decrease acceptance of the internet and online services as a means of communication, e-commerce, and advertising. In addition, such changes in laws could increase our costs of doing business or prevent us from delivering our services over the internet or in specific jurisdictions, which could harm our business and our results of operations.\nOur exposure to tax liabilities may be greater than anticipated and may be affected by changes in tax laws or interpretations, any of which could adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and various jurisdictions outside of the United States. Our effective tax rate could fluctuate due to changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates. Our tax expense could also be impacted by changes in non-deductible expenses, changes in the tax treatment of equity-based compensation, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our ability to utilize them, the applicability of withholding taxes, effects from acquisitions, and the evaluation of new information that results in a change to a tax position taken in a prior period.\nChanges in accounting principles, changes in U.S. federal, state, local or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries, including the United States, and changes in taxing jurisdictions\u2019 administrative interpretations, positions, decisions, and policies could also impact our tax position. For example, on December 22, 2017, tax reform legislation referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act, was enacted in the United States. We have reflected the impact of the Tax Act in our financial statements in accordance with our understanding of the Tax Act and guidance available as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Although the impact of the Tax Act was not material on our consolidated financial statements, many consequences of the Tax Act, including whether and how state, local, and\nforeign jurisdictions continue reacting to such changes are unclear and the U.S. Department of Treasury may continue issuing regulations and interpretive guidance that may significantly impact how the Tax Act applies to us. Any of the foregoing changes could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nAdditionally, the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development released guidance covering various topics, including transfer pricing, country-by-country reporting, and definitional changes to permanent establishment that could ultimately impact our tax liabilities in various jurisdictions.\nOur results of operations may be harmed if we are required to collect sales or other related taxes for our subscription services in jurisdictions where we have not historically done so.\nWe collect sales and value-added tax as part of our subscription agreements in a number of jurisdictions. Sales and use, value-added, and similar tax laws and rates vary greatly by jurisdiction. One or more states or countries may seek to impose additional sales, use, or other tax collection obligations on us, including for past sales by us. Furthermore, since U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in South Dakota v. Wayfair, many states have implemented economic nexus laws that could require an online retailer with no in-state property or personnel to collect and remit sales tax on sales to the state\u2019s residents and may permit wider enforcement of sales tax collection requirements. A successful assertion by a state, country, or other jurisdiction that we should have been or should be collecting additional sales, use, or other taxes on our platform could, among other things, result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales, create significant administrative burdens for us, discourage customers from purchasing our platform, or otherwise harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to utilize a significant portion of our net operating loss or research tax credit carryforwards, which could adversely affect our potential profitability.\nWe have federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, due to prior period losses, some of which, if not utilized, will begin to expire in 2030 for both federal and state purposes. As of December 31, 2020 we had federal NOLs of $416.2 million and state NOLs of $200.4 million. These NOLs and NOLs of companies we may acquire could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities, which could adversely affect our potential profitability.\nUnder Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, our ability to utilize NOLs or other tax attributes, such as research tax credits and excess business interest, in any taxable year may be limited to the extent we have experienced an \u201cownership change.\u201d Such an \u201cownership change\u201d generally occurs if one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who own at least 5% of our stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage over a three-year period. Past or future transactions among our stockholders may trigger an \u201cownership change.\u201d\nThe nature of our business requires the application of complex accounting rules, including revenue and expense recognition rules, and any significant changes in current rules, or interpretations thereof, could affect our financial statements and results of operations.\nThe accounting rules and regulations that we must comply with are complex and subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or the FASB, the SEC, and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. Recent actions and public comments from the FASB and the SEC are focused on the integrity of financial reporting and internal controls over financial reporting. Many companies\u2019 accounting policies and practices are being subject to heightened scrutiny by regulators and the public. In addition, the accounting rules and regulations are continually changing in ways that could materially impact our financial statements. We cannot predict the impact of future changes to accounting principles or our accounting policies on our financial statements going forward, which could significantly affect our reported financial results, and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of the change. Further, if we were to change our critical accounting estimates, including those related to the recognition of revenue, our results of operations could be significantly affected.\nIf our judgments or estimates relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect, our results of operations could fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in our stock price.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in the section entitled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, and equity, and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our results of operations may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our results of operations to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the trading price of our Class A common stock. Significant judgments, estimates, and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include, or may in the future include, those related to revenue recognition, equity-based compensation expense, sales commissions costs, long-lived assets, business combinations, and accounting for income taxes including deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nWe previously identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that resulted in the restatement of certain of our financial statements, and we may identify material weaknesses in the future.\nWe previously reported a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2018 associated with the accounting for non-standard share-based payment awards. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K/A filed March 2, 2020, we took a number of measures to remediate the material weakness described above and concluded that the material weakness described above was remediated as of December 31, 2019. However, if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control occur in the future, it may adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations in a timely and accurate manner. If we fail to report our results in a timely and accurate manner, we may be required to pay additional interest under our convertible notes, which could adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition. Although we continually review and evaluate internal control systems to allow management to report on the sufficiency of our internal control over financial reporting, we cannot assure you that we will not discover additional weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If we identify one or more new material weaknesses or are unable to timely remediate our existing material weakness, we may not assert that our internal controls are effective. If we can not assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, investors could lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock and possibly impact our ability to obtain future financing on acceptable terms. Additionally, our management\u2019s attention has been, and may further be, diverted from the operation of our business as a result of the time and attention required to address the remediation of any material weakness in our internal controls.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the rules and regulations of the listing standards of Nasdaq. The requirements of these rules and regulations increased our legal, accounting, and financial compliance costs, made some activities more difficult, time-consuming, and costly, and placed significant strain on our personnel, systems, and resources. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and\nfinancial officers. Our efforts to enhance and improve our internal control over financial reporting are ongoing. In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we expended, and anticipate continuing to expend, significant resources, including accounting-related costs and significant management oversight.\nOur current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. Moreover, we previously identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the establishment of accounting policies for non-standard equity-based compensation awards, and weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls, any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement, or any failure to remediate our material weakness, could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, which we are required to include in our periodic reports filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls, procedures and internal control over financial reporting could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which could negatively affect the trading price of our Class A common stock. If we do not meet these requirements, we may not remain listed on Nasdaq. As a public company, we are required to provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting commencing with this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control over financial reporting is documented, designed, or operating, it may issue an adverse report. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations and cause a decline in the price of our Class A common stock.\nRisks Related to Future Debt and Our Convertible Senior Notes\nServicing our future debt may require a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our indebtedness.\nIn March 2019, we issued $633.5 million aggregate principal amount of 0.375% convertible senior notes due in 2024, or the Notes. Making scheduled payments of the principal of, paying interest on, or refinancing our indebtedness, including the Notes, depends on our future performance and financial condition, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue generating cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we do not generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring our existing debt or obtaining additional debt financing or equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at the time. In addition, any of our future debt agreements may contain restrictive covenants that may prohibit us from adopting any of these alternatives or may restrict the way in which we operate our business. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of our debt.\nIn the event we or our subsidiaries incur substantially more debt in the future, some of which may be secured debt, our exposure to these risks could intensify. We are not restricted under the terms of the indenture governing the Notes from incurring additional debt, securing existing or future debt, recapitalizing our debt, repurchasing our stock, pledging our assets, making investments, paying dividends, guaranteeing debt, or taking a number of other actions any of which, if taken, could diminish our payments on the Notes when due.\nWe may not raise the funds necessary to make periodic interest payments, pay the principal amount at maturity, settle conversions of the Notes in cash or repurchase the Notes upon a fundamental change, and our future debt may contain limitations on paying cash upon conversion of the Notes or repurchasing the Notes.\nHolders of the Notes have the right to require us to repurchase their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. In addition, upon conversion of the Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our Class A common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the Notes being converted. Moreover, we will be required to repay the Notes in cash at their maturity unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. Meeting our obligations to holders of the Notes will depend on the earnings and cash flows of Pluralsight Holdings. However, if Pluralsight Holdings does not provide cash to us to meet our obligations under the Notes, we may not have enough available cash on hand or obtain financing at the time we are required to make payments with respect to Notes at maturity, upon surrender for repurchase or upon conversion. In addition, our ability to repurchase the Notes or to pay cash upon conversions of the Notes or at maturity may be limited by law, regulatory authority or agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture governing the Notes or pay any cash payable on future conversions of the Notes or at maturity as required by such indenture would constitute a default under such indenture. A default under the indenture, or upon a fundamental change itself, could lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the Notes is triggered, holders of Notes will be entitled to convert the Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. Unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our Class A common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share) and one or more holders elect to convert their Notes, we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nConversion of the Notes may dilute the ownership interest of our stockholders or may otherwise depress the prices of our Class A common stock.\nThe conversion of some or all of the Notes may dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders. Upon conversion of the Notes, we have the option to pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our Class A common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our Class A common stock. If we elect to settle our conversion obligation in shares of our Class A common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our Class A common stock, any sales in the public market of our Class A common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our Class A common stock. In addition, the existence of the Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of the Notes into shares of our Class A common stock could depress the price of our Class A common stock.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the Notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nUnder the FASB Accounting Standards Codification 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options, or ASC 470-20, an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments (such as the Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer\u2019s economic interest cost. ASC 470-20 requires the value of the conversion option of the Notes, representing\nthe equity component, be recorded as additional paid-in capital within stockholders\u2019 equity in our consolidated balance sheet and as a discount to the Notes, which reduces their initial carrying value. The carrying value of the Notes, net of the discount recorded, will be accreted up to the principal amount of the Notes from the issuance date until maturity, which will result in non-cash charges to interest expense in our consolidated statement of operations. Accordingly, we will report lower net income or higher net loss in our financial results because ASC 470-20 requires interest to include both the current period\u2019s accretion of the debt discount and the instrument\u2019s coupon, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the trading price of our Class A common stock and the trading price of the Notes.\nIn addition, under certain circumstances, convertible debt instruments (such as the Notes) that may be settled entirely or partly in cash are currently accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent the conversion value of the Notes exceeds their principal amount, and the effect of the conversion on diluted earnings per share is not antidilutive. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of Class A common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued. In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity\u2019s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity\u2019s Own Equity, which amends these accounting standards to eliminate the treasury stock method for convertible instruments and require application of the \u201cif-converted\u201d method, which may have the effect of diluting our reported earnings per share. ASU 2020-06 also no longer requires separate accounting for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments. This could have the impact of reducing non-cash interest expense, and thereby increasing net income.\nCertain provisions in the indenture governing the Notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover attempt of us.\nCertain provisions in the indenture governing the Notes may make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire us. For example, the indenture governing the Notes will require us to repurchase the Notes for cash upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the Notes) of us and, in certain circumstances, to increase the conversion rate for a holder that converts its Notes in connection with a make-whole fundamental change. A takeover of us may trigger the requirement that we repurchase the Notes and/or increase the conversion rate, which could make it more costly for a potential acquirer to engage in such a takeover. These additional costs may delay or prevent a takeover of us that would otherwise be beneficial to investors.\nThe capped call transactions may affect the value of the Notes and our Class A common stock.\nIn connection with the capped call transactions, the counterparties, or their respective affiliates, may purchase shares of our Class A common stock, and/or enter into or modify various derivative transactions with respect to our Class A common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the Notes. This activity could cause or prevent market price fluctuation of our Class A common stock or the Notes. We cannot make any prediction as to the discretion or magnitude of any potential effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the Notes or the shares of our Class A common stock.\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the capped call transactions.\nThe counterparties to the capped call transactions are financial institutions and we will be subject to the risk that one or more of the counterparties may default or otherwise fail to perform, or may exercise certain rights to terminate, their obligations under the capped call transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. Some recent global economic conditions resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. If a counterparty to one or more capped call transaction becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under such transaction. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, it will increase if the market price or the volatility of our Class A common stock increases. Upon a default or other failure to perform, or a termination of obligations, by a counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and\nmore dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our Class A common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of the counterparties.\nRisks Related to Our Organizational Structure\nOur principal asset is our interest in Pluralsight Holdings, and we depend on Pluralsight Holdings and its consolidated subsidiaries for our results of operations, cash flows, and distributions since we have no means to independently generate them.\nWe are a holding company and have no material assets other than our ownership of the LLC Units of Pluralsight Holdings. As such, we have no independent means of generating revenue or cash flow, and our ability to pay our taxes and operating expenses or declare and pay dividends in the future, if any, depend upon the results of operations and cash flows of Pluralsight Holdings and its consolidated subsidiaries and distributions we receive from Pluralsight Holdings. There can be no assurance that our subsidiaries will generate sufficient cash flow to distribute funds to us or that applicable state law and contractual restrictions will permit such distributions.\nOur ability to pay taxes and expenses, including payments under the TRA, may be limited by our structure.\nOur principal asset is a controlling equity interest in Pluralsight Holdings. As such, we have no independent means of generating revenue. Pluralsight Holdings is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, is generally not subject to U.S. federal income tax. Instead, taxable income is allocated to holders of its LLC Units, including us. Accordingly, we incur income taxes on our allocatable share of any net taxable income of Pluralsight Holdings and incur expenses related to our operations. Pursuant to the Fourth LLC Agreement, Pluralsight Holdings will make cash distributions to the owners of LLC Units in an amount sufficient to fund their tax obligations in respect of the cumulative taxable income in excess of cumulative taxable losses of Pluralsight Holdings that is allocated to them, to the extent previous tax distributions from Pluralsight Holdings have been insufficient. In addition to tax expenses, we incur expenses related to our operations, plus payments under the TRA or the TRA Amendment, as applicable, which we expect could be significant given the tax benefits associated with exchanges of LLC Units are more-likely-than-not to be realized. We intend to cause Pluralsight Holdings to make distributions or, in the case of certain expenses, payments in an amount sufficient to allow us to pay our taxes and operating expenses, including distributions to fund any ordinary course payments due under the TRA. However, Pluralsight Holdings\u2019 ability to make such distributions may be subject to various limitations and restrictions. If we do not have sufficient funds to pay tax or other liabilities or to fund our operations (as a result of Pluralsight Holdings\u2019 inability to make distributions due to various limitations and restrictions or as a result of the acceleration of our obligations under the TRA), we may have to borrow funds and our liquidity and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nTo the extent we do not make payments under the TRA when due, as a result of having insufficient funds or otherwise, interest will generally accrue at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 100 basis points or in some cases LIBOR plus 600 basis points until paid. The UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, the authority regulating LIBOR, announced in July 2017 its intention to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. It is uncertain whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established to prolong its use after 2021. If we determine, or it is otherwise publicly announced, that LIBOR is no longer a widely recognized benchmark rate, the TRA requires us to establish a replacement interest rate, or Replacement Rate, to be applied in a manner consistent with market practice. Nonpayment of our obligations for a specified period may constitute a breach of a material obligation under the TRA, and may cause acceleration of payments due under the TRA resulting in a lump-sum payment. See the section entitled \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Party Transactions-Tax Receivable Agreement\u201d for additional information.\nWe will be required to pay the TRA Members for certain tax benefits we may claim, and we expect the payments we will be required to make will be substantial.\nExchanges or redemptions of LLC Units for cash or shares of our Class A common stock are expected to produce favorable tax attributes for us. When we acquire LLC Units from the Continuing Members through these exchanges or redemptions, anticipated tax basis adjustments are likely to increase (for tax purposes) our depreciation and amortization deductions, thereby reducing the amount of income tax we would be required to pay in the future\nin the absence of this increased basis. This increased tax basis may also decrease the gain (or increase the loss) on future dispositions of certain assets to the extent the tax basis is allocated to those assets. Under the TRA, we generally expect to retain the benefit of 15% of the applicable tax savings after our payment obligations below are taken into account.\nWe are a party to the TRA. Under the TRA, we generally will be required to pay to the TRA Members 85% of the applicable savings, if any, in income tax that we realize, or that we are deemed to realize, as a result of (i) certain tax attributes that are created as a result of the exchanges or redemptions of their LLC Units (calculated under certain assumptions), (ii) tax benefits related to imputed interest, and (iii) payments under such TRA.\nThe increase in tax basis, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under these agreements, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of exchanges or redemptions, the price of our Class A common stock at the time of the exchange or redemption, whether such exchanges or redemptions are taxable, the amount and timing of the taxable income we generate in the future, the U.S. federal and state tax rates then applicable, and the portion of our payments under the TRA constituting imputed interest. Payments under the TRA are expected to give rise to certain additional tax benefits attributable to either further increases in basis or in the form of deductions for imputed interest, depending on the circumstances. Any such benefits are covered by the TRA and will increase the amounts due thereunder. In addition, the TRA will provide for interest, generally at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 100 basis points, accrued from the due date (without extensions) of the corresponding tax return to the date of payment specified by the TRA. If the discontinuation of LIBOR as discussed above materializes as expected by 2022, we are required under the TRA to replace the use of LIBOR in the TRA with a Replacement Rate to be applied in a manner consistent with market practice.\nAs a result of the exchanges made under our structure, we may incur a TRA liability. We have not recorded, and do not expect to record, a TRA liability until the tax benefits associated with the exchanges are more-likely-than-not to be realized. Had the tax benefits been more-likely-than not to be realized, the estimated TRA liability that could result from past exchanges would have been $345.1 million as of December 31, 2020.\nWe expect our required payments to the TRA Members will be substantial. To the extent we do not make timely payments under the TRA, the unpaid amounts will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid by us. Nonpayment for a specified period may constitute a material breach of a material obligation under the TRA and may cause acceleration of payments due under the TRA. Furthermore, our future obligation to make payments under the TRA could make us a less attractive target for an acquisition, particularly in the case of an acquirer that cannot use some or all of the tax benefits that may be deemed realized under the TRA. See the section entitled \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Party Transactions-Tax Receivable Agreement,\u201d for a discussion of the TRA and the related likely benefits to be realized by the TRA Members.\nPayments under the TRA will be based on the tax reporting positions that we determine. Although we are not aware of any issue that could cause the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, to challenge a tax basis increase or other tax attributes subject to the TRA, if any subsequent disallowance of tax basis or other benefits were so determined by the IRS, generally we would not be reimbursed for any payments previously made under the applicable TRA (although we would reduce future amounts otherwise payable under such TRA). As a result, payments could be made under the TRA in excess of the tax savings we realize in respect of the attributes to which the TRA relate.\nThe amounts that we may be required to pay to the TRA Members under the TRA may be accelerated in certain circumstances and may also significantly exceed the actual tax benefits that we ultimately realize.\nThe TRA provides that if certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combination, or other changes of control were to occur or if, at any time, we elect an early termination of the TRA, then the TRA will terminate and our obligations, or our successor\u2019s obligations, to make future payments under the TRA would accelerate and become immediately due and payable. The amount due and payable in those circumstances is determined based on certain assumptions, including an assumption that we would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize all potential future tax benefits that are subject to the TRA. We may need to incur debt to finance payments under the TRA to the extent our cash resources are insufficient to meet our obligations under the TRA as a result of timing\ndiscrepancies or otherwise. In these situations, our obligations under the TRA could substantially and negatively impact our liquidity and delay, defer or prevent certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combination, or other changes of control. There can be no assurance that we will be able to finance our obligations under the TRA. See the section entitled \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Party Transactions-Tax Receivable Agreement\u201d for additional information. The TRA was amended on December 11, 2020, the TRA Amendment, in connection with the Merger Agreement, with the parties agreeing that the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement will trigger the TRA Payments of $127.0 million and will constitute Early Termination Payments, each as defined in the TRA Amendment. Upon consummation of the Mergers, the TRA shall be terminated in its entirety, as provided for in the TRA Amendment.\nOur organizational structure, including the TRA, confers certain benefits upon Continuing Members that will not benefit Class A common stockholders to the same extent as it will benefit the Continuing Members.\nOur organizational structure, including the TRA, confers certain benefits upon the Continuing Members that does not benefit the holders of our Class A common stock to the same extent as it benefits the Continuing Members. The TRA with Pluralsight Holdings and the Continuing Members provides for the payment by us to the TRA Members of 85% of the amount of tax benefits, if any, that we realize, or in some circumstances are deemed to realize, as a result of (i) the increases in the tax basis of assets of Pluralsight Holdings resulting from any redemptions or exchanges of LLC Units from the Continuing Members as described under the section entitled \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Party Transactions-Fourth Amended and Restated LLC Agreement\u201d and (ii) certain other tax benefits related to our making payments under the TRA. See the section entitled \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Party Transactions-Tax Receivable Agreement\u201d for additional information. Although we will retain 15% of the amount of such tax benefits, this and other aspects of our organizational structure may adversely impact the trading market for the Class A common stock.\nGenerally, we will not be reimbursed for any payments made to TRA Members under the TRA in the event that any tax benefits are disallowed.\nIf the IRS challenges the tax basis or other tax attributes that give rise to payments under the TRA and the tax basis or other tax attributes are subsequently required to be adjusted, generally the recipients of payments under the TRA will not reimburse us for any payments we previously made to them. Instead, any excess cash payments made by us to a TRA Member will be netted against any future cash payments we might otherwise be required to make under the terms of the TRA. However, a challenge to any tax benefits initially claimed by us may not arise for a number of years following the initial time of such payment or, even if challenged early, such excess cash payment may be greater than the amount of future cash payments that we might otherwise be required to make under the terms of the TRA and, as a result, there might not be future cash payments to net against. The applicable U.S. federal income tax rules are complex and factual in nature, and there can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will not disagree with our tax reporting positions. As a result, it is possible that we could make cash payments under the TRA that are substantially greater than our actual cash tax savings. See the section entitled \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Party Transactions-Tax Receivable Agreement\u201d for additional information.\nThe disparity between the U.S. corporate tax rate and the U.S. tax rate applicable to non-corporate members of Pluralsight Holdings may complicate our ability to maintain our intended capital structure, which could impose transaction costs on us and require management attention.\nIf and when we generate taxable income, Pluralsight Holdings will generally make quarterly tax distributions to each of its members, including us, based on each member\u2019s allocable share of net taxable income (calculated under certain assumptions) multiplied by an assumed tax rate. The assumed tax rate for this purpose will be the highest effective marginal combined federal, state, and local income tax rate that may potentially apply to any member for the applicable fiscal year. The Tax Act significantly reduced the highest marginal federal income tax rate applicable to corporations such as Pluralsight, Inc., relative to non-corporate taxpayers. As a result of this disparity, we expect to receive tax distributions from Pluralsight Holdings significantly in excess of our actual tax liability and our obligations under the TRA, which could result in our accumulating a significant amount of cash. This would complicate our ability to maintain certain aspects of our capital structure. Such cash, if retained, could cause the value of an LLC Unit to deviate from the value of a share of Class A common stock, contrary to the one-to-one\nrelationship described in the section entitled \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Party Transactions-Fourth Amended and Restated LLC Agreement\u201d for additional information. Such cash, if used to purchase additional LLC Units, could result in deviation from the one-to-one relationship between Class A common stock outstanding and LLC Units of Pluralsight Holdings held by Pluralsight, Inc. unless a corresponding number of additional shares of Class A common stock are distributed as a stock dividend. We may choose to pay dividends to all holders of Class A common stock with any excess cash. These considerations could have unintended impacts on the pricing of our Class A common stock and may impose transaction costs and require management efforts to address on a recurring basis. To the extent we do not distribute such excess cash as dividends on our Class A common stock and instead, for example, hold such cash balances or lend them to Pluralsight Holdings, the Continuing Members in Pluralsight Holdings during a period in which we hold such cash balances could benefit from the value attributable to such cash balances as a result of redeeming or exchanging their LLC Units and obtaining ownership of Class A common stock (or a cash payment based on the value of Class A common stock). In such case, these Continuing Members could receive disproportionate value for their LLC Units exchanged during this time frame.\nRisks Related to Entering into a Definitive Agreement to Be Acquired\nThe announcement and pendency of the proposed Mergers could adversely affect our business.\nOn December 11, 2020, we announced that we had entered into the Merger Agreement with Vista. Uncertainty about the effect of the Mergers on our customers, employees, partners, and other parties may adversely affect our business. Our employees may experience uncertainty about their roles or seniority following the Mergers. There can be no assurance that our employees, including key personnel, can be retained, or that we will be able to attract and retain employees to the same extent that we have previously been able to. Any loss or distraction of such employees could adversely affect our business and operations. In addition, we have diverted, and will continue to divert, significant management resources, and have expended, and will continue to expend, significant cash amounts, toward the completion of the Mergers, which could adversely affect our business and operations. Certain of our stockholders presently publicly oppose the Mergers and may attempt to solicit our stockholders to vote against the Mergers, which has increased these risks. Parties with which we do business may experience uncertainty associated with the Mergers, including with respect to current or future business relationships with us. Uncertainty may cause customers to refrain from doing business with us, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe failure to complete the Mergers could adversely affect our business.\nConsummation of the Mergers is subject to several conditions beyond our control. If any of these conditions are not satisfied or waived, it is possible that the Mergers will not be consummated in the expected time frame (or at all) or that the Merger Agreement may be terminated. If the Mergers are not completed, the share price of our Class A common stock may decrease to the extent that the current market price of our Class A common stock reflects an assumption that the Mergers will be completed. In addition, under circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement, we may be required to pay a termination fee of $104.6 million to Vista. Further, a failed transaction may result in negative publicity and a negative impression of us in the investment community. Any disruption to our business resulting from the announcement and pendency of the Mergers and from intensifying competition from our competitors, including any adverse changes in our relationships with our customers, employees, partners and other parties, could continue or accelerate in the event of a failed transaction. There can be no assurance that our business, relationships with other parties, liquidity or financial condition will not be adversely affected, as compared to the condition prior to the announcement of the Mergers, if the Mergers are not consummated.\nWhile the Mergers are pending, we are subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions that could harm our operations and the future of our business.\nPursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, we are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our business. These restrictions subject us to a variety of specified limitations, including limiting our ability, in certain cases, to enter into material contracts, acquire or dispose of assets, incur indebtedness, or incur capital expenditures, until the Mergers become effective or the Merger Agreement is terminated. These restrictions may inhibit our ability to take actions that we may consider advantageous, and may limit our ability to respond to future business\nopportunities and industry developments that may arise. The pendency of the Mergers has diverted, and may continue to divert, management\u2019s attention and our resources from our ongoing business and operations. Our customers, employees, partners, and other parties may have uncertainties about the effects of the Mergers. In connection with the Mergers, it is possible that some customers and other persons with whom we have a business relationship may delay or defer certain business decisions or might decide to seek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationship with us as a result of the Mergers. If any of these effects were to occur, it could materially and adversely impact our business, cash flow, results of operations or financial condition, as well as the market price of our Class A common stock and our perceived value, regardless of whether the Mergers are completed. In addition, whether or not the Mergers are completed, while the Merger Agreement is in effect we will continue to incur costs, fees, expenses and charges related to the Mergers, which may materially and adversely affect our financial condition.\nThe Merger Agreement limits our ability to pursue alternatives to the Mergers.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that make it more difficult for us to enter into alternative change-of-control transactions. The Merger Agreement contains certain provisions that restrict our ability to, among other things, solicit alternative acquisition proposals from third parties and provide information to, and participate in discussions and engage in negotiations with, third parties regarding any alternative acquisition proposals. The Merger Agreement also provides that, subject to limited exceptions, the Board will not change its recommendation to our stockholders in favor of the Mergers and will not approve any agreement with respect to an alternative acquisition proposal.\nThese provisions might discourage a third party that has an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of us from considering or proposing such acquisition, even if such party were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per-share value than that offered by Vista. Furthermore, the requirement that we pay a termination fee under certain circumstances may result in a third party proposing to pay a lower per-share price to acquire us than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee.\nWe are subject to litigation, and we may become subject to additional litigation, in connection with the Mergers, which could be costly, prevent consummation of the Mergers, divert management\u2019s attention and otherwise materially harm our business.\nFor information regarding current legal proceedings regarding the Mergers, please see Note 12 to our financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Regardless of the outcome of any current or future litigation related to the Mergers, such litigation may be time-consuming and expensive and may distract our management from running the day-to-day operations of our business. The litigation costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources to address the claims and counterclaims in any litigation related to the Mergers may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, prospects and financial condition. If the Mergers are not consummated for any reason, litigation could be filed in connection with the failure to consummate the Mergers. Any litigation related to the Mergers may result in negative publicity or an unfavorable impression of us, which could adversely affect the price of our Class A common stock, impair our ability to recruit or retain employees, damage our relationships with our customers and other third parties, or otherwise materially harm our operations and financial performance.\nRisks Related to Our Class A Common Stock\nThe Continuing Members have the right to have their LLC Units exchanged for shares of Class A common stock and any disclosure of such exchange or the subsequent sale of such Class A common stock may cause volatility in our stock price.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have an aggregate of 25,524,732 shares of Class A common stock that are issuable upon exchange of LLC Units that are held by the Continuing Members. Under the Fourth LLC Agreement, the Continuing Members will be entitled to have their LLC Units exchanged for shares of our Class A common stock.\nWe cannot predict the timing, size, or disclosure of any future issuances of our Class A common stock resulting from the exchange of LLC Units or the effect, if any, that future issuances, disclosure, if any, or sales of shares of our Class A common stock may have on the market price of our Class A common stock. Sales or distributions of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock, or the perception that such sales or distributions could occur, may cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.\nThe multi-class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with Aaron Skonnard, our co-founder, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman, which limits or precludes your influence as a stockholder on corporate matters and may have a negative impact on the price of our Class A common stock.\nOur Class C common stock has 10 votes per share, our Class B common stock has one vote per share, and our Class A common stock, our publicly traded stock, has one vote per share. Aaron Skonnard, our co-founder, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman, personally and through his associated entities, holds all our issued and outstanding Class C common stock, and as of December 31, 2020, holds approximately 50.2% of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock. As restricted share units of Pluralsight Holdings held by Mr. Skonnard vest over time, he will receive additional LLC Units and Class C common stock with 10 votes per share. As a result, Mr. Skonnard and his associated entities have the ability to control or significantly influence any action requiring the general approval of our stockholders, including the election and removal of our directors, amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, the approval of any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transaction. Many of these actions may be taken even if they are opposed by other stockholders. This concentration of ownership and voting power may delay, defer, or prevent an acquisition by a third party or other change of control of us and may make some transactions more difficult or impossible without his support, even if such events are in the best interests of other stockholders. This concentration of voting power with Mr. Skonnard and his associated entities may have a negative impact on the price of our Class A common stock.\nAs our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Skonnard controls our day-to-day management and the implementation of major strategic investments of our company, subject to authorization and oversight by our board of directors. As a board member and officer, Mr. Skonnard owes fiduciary duties to us and our stockholders, including those of care and loyalty, and must act in good faith and with a view to the interests of the corporation. As a stockholder, even a controlling stockholder, Mr. Skonnard is entitled to vote his shares, and shares over which he has voting control, in his own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally. Because Mr. Skonnard, personally and through his associated entities, holds his economic interest in our business primarily through Pluralsight Holdings, rather than through the public company, he may have conflicting interests with holders of shares of our Class A common stock. For example, Mr. Skonnard may have a different tax position from us, which could influence his decisions regarding whether and when we should dispose of assets or incur new or refinance existing indebtedness, especially in light of the existence of the TRA, and whether and when we should undergo certain changes of control within the meaning of the TRA or terminate the TRA. In addition, the structuring of future transactions may take into consideration these tax or other considerations even where no similar benefit would accrue to us. See the section entitled \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Party Transactions-Tax Receivable Agreement\u201d for additional information. In addition, Mr. Skonnard\u2019s significant ownership in us and resulting ability to effectively control or significantly influence us may discourage someone from making a significant equity investment in us, or could discourage transactions involving a change in control, including transactions in which you as a holder of shares of our Class A common stock might otherwise receive a premium for your shares over the then-current market price.\nIn addition, in July 2017, Standard & Poor\u2019s announced that they would cease allowing most newly public companies utilizing dual or multi-class capital structures to be included in their indices. Affected indices include the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, and S&P SmallCap 600, which together make up the S&P Composite 1500. Under the announced policies, our multi-class capital structure makes us ineligible for inclusion in any of these indices, and as a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and other investment vehicles that attempt to passively track these indices will not invest in our stock. Because of our dual class structure, we may be excluded from these indexes and we cannot assure you that other stock indexes will not take similar actions. Given the sustained flow of investment funds into passive strategies that seek to track certain indexes, exclusion from stock indexes would likely preclude investment by many of these funds and could make our Class A common stock less attractive to other investors.\nAlthough we do not rely on the \u201ccontrolled company\u201d exemption under the rules and regulations of Nasdaq, we have the right to use such exemption and therefore we could in the future avail ourselves of certain reduced corporate governance requirements.\nAaron Skonnard and his associated entities, collectively, hold a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock, and therefore we are considered a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d as that term is set forth in the rules and regulations of Nasdaq. Under these rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by a person or group of persons acting together is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and may elect not to comply with certain rules and regulations of Nasdaq regarding corporate governance, including:\n\u2022the requirement that a majority of its board of directors consist of independent directors;\n\u2022the requirement that its director nominees be selected or recommended for the board\u2019s selection by a majority of the board\u2019s independent directors in a vote in which only independent directors participate or by a nominating committee comprised solely of independent directors, in either case, with board resolutions or a written charter, as applicable, addressing the nominations process and related matters as required under the federal securities laws; and\n\u2022the requirement that its compensation committee be composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purposes and responsibilities.\nThese requirements would not apply to us if, in the future, we choose to avail ourselves of the \u201ccontrolled company\u201d exemption. Although we qualify as a \u201ccontrolled company,\u201d we do not currently rely on these exemptions and we fully comply with all corporate governance requirements under the rules and regulations of Nasdaq, including any phase-in periods specified thereunder. However, if we were to utilize some or all of these exemptions, we would not comply with certain of the corporate governance standards of Nasdaq, which could adversely affect the protections for other stockholders.\nOur stock price may continue being volatile, and it may decline regardless of our operating performance.\nPrior to our IPO, there was no public market for shares of our Class A common stock. On May 17, 2018, we sold shares of our Class A common stock to the public at $15.00 per share. From May 17, 2018, the date that shares of our Class A common stock began trading on Nasdaq, through December 31, 2020, the market price for our Class A common stock has ranged from $6.59 per share to $38.37 per share. The market price of our Class A common stock may continue fluctuating significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, among others:\n\u2022whether the Mergers are consummated;\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and other results of operations, including as a result of the addition or loss of any number of customers;\n\u2022competitive headwinds, including announcements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments;\n\u2022the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections, or our failure to meet these projections;\n\u2022failure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in ratings and financial estimates and the publication of other news by any securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\u2022changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of SaaS-based software or other technology companies, or those in our industry in particular;\n\u2022the size of our public float;\n\u2022price and volume fluctuations in the trading of our Class A common stock and in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;\n\u2022new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business or industry, including data privacy, data protection, and information security;\n\u2022lawsuits threatened or filed against us for claims relating to intellectual property, employment issues, or otherwise;\n\u2022actual or perceived security breaches;\n\u2022changes in our board of directors or management;\n\u2022short sales, hedging, and other derivative transactions involving our Class A common stock;\n\u2022sales of large blocks of our Class A common stock including sales by our executive officers, directors, and significant stockholders;\n\u2022the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business operations and overall financial performance; and\n\u2022other events or factors, including changes in general economic, industry, and market conditions, and trends, as well as any natural disasters, which may affect our operations.\nFollowing a period of volatility in the market price of our securities, we became the subject of securities litigation. For example, in August 2019, a class action complaint was filed by a stockholder in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against us and certain of our officers alleging violation of securities laws and seeking unspecified damages. For more information, please see Note 12 to our financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFollowing a period of volatility in the market price of our securities, we became the subject of securities litigation. We may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility. This type of litigation may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nAdverse economic conditions in the United States and international countries has impacted and may continue to adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nUnfavorable general economic conditions, such as the existing COVID-19 pandemic-driven recession or economic slowdown in the United States or in one or more of our other major markets, has and may continue to adversely affect demand for our platform. Changing macroeconomic conditions may affect our business in a number of ways. For example, spending patterns of businesses are sensitive to the general economic climate. Technology spending by our customers or prospective customers has been and may continue to be impacted by conditions presented by the COVID-19 pandemic as customers may deem subscriptions to our platform discretionary. During 2020, we saw and may continue to see customers or prospective customers reduce or delay their purchasing decisions, limit their ability to purchase our offerings, reduce their ability to provide payment under existing contracts, prolong payment periods, decrease our customer retention, or delay our ability to provision our products and services, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations, future sales, and overall financial performance. Subscriptions for our platform may be considered discretionary by many of our current and potential customers. As a result, businesses considering whether to purchase or renew subscriptions to our products may be influenced by macroeconomic factors.\nThere is significant uncertainty, which has intensified as a result of the conditions presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, about the future relationship between the United States and other countries with respect to trade policies, treaties, government relations, and tariffs. The previous U.S. presidential administration called for substantial changes to U.S. foreign trade policy with China and other countries, including the possibility of imposing greater\nrestrictions on international trade and significant increases in tariffs on goods imported into the United States. Many of our customers who conduct business in China may be impacted by these policies or any new policies called for by the current U.S. presidential administration. If the United States\u2019 relationship with China deteriorates or results in trade protection measures, retaliatory actions, tariffs, or increased barriers, policies that favor domestic industries, or heightened import or export licensing requirements or restrictions, then our operations and business may be adversely affected due to such changes in the economic and political ecosystem.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by changes in the United States political environment.\nThere is significant ongoing uncertainty with respect to potential legislation, regulation and government policy at the federal level, as well as the state and local levels in the United States. Any such changes could significantly impact our business as well as the markets in which we compete. Specific legislative and regulatory proposals discussed during election campaigns and more recently that might materially impact us include, but are not limited to, changes to import and export regulations, income tax regulations and the U.S. federal tax code and public company reporting requirements. To the extent changes in the political environment have a negative impact on us or on our markets, our business, results of operation and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted in the future.\nWe continue incurring increased costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAs a public company, we incur greater legal, accounting, and other expenses than we incurred as a private company. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, and the rules and regulations of Nasdaq. Recently, we devoted substantial management effort and incurred significant expenses toward ensuring compliance with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We also hired additional accounting and financial professionals with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge.\nThese requirements, and any modifications, increase our legal, accounting, and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. For example, these rules and regulations make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as our executive officers.\nFuture sales of shares by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock in the public market could occur at any time. If our stockholders sell, or the market perceives that our stockholders intend to sell, substantial amounts of our Class A common stock in the public market following our offering in June 2020, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they downgrade our common stock, the price of our Class A common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock depends, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not influence or control these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price could decline. In addition, if our results of operations fail to meet the forecast of analysts, our stock price could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our Class A common stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nOur issuance of additional capital stock in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, our equity incentive plans, or otherwise could dilute all other stockholders.\nWe expect to issue additional capital stock in the future that will result in dilution to all other stockholders. For example, we expect to grant equity awards under our equity incentive plans. We may also raise capital through equity financings in the future. As part of our business strategy, we may acquire or make investments in complementary companies, products, or technologies, and issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition or investment. Any such issuances of additional capital stock may cause stockholders to experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the per share value of our Class A common stock to decline.\nWe generally do not intend to pay dividends.\nWe generally do not intend to pay dividends to the holders of our Class A common stock for the foreseeable future, except possibly in connection with maintaining certain aspects of our UP-C structure. See the section entitled \u201c-Risks Related to Our Organizational Structure-The disparity between the U.S. corporate tax rate and the U.S. tax rate applicable to non-corporate members of Pluralsight Holdings may complicate our ability to maintain our intended capital structure, which could impose transaction costs on us and require management attention.\u201d Our ability to pay dividends on our Class A common stock may be restricted by the terms of any future debt incurred or preferred securities issued by us or our subsidiaries or law. Payments of future dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including our business, financial condition, and results of operations, current and anticipated cash needs, plans for expansion and any legal or contractual limitation on our ability to pay dividends. As a result, any capital appreciation in the price of our Class A common stock may be your only source of gain on your investment in our Class A common stock.\nIf, however, we decide to pay a dividend in the future, we would likely need to cause Pluralsight Holdings to make distributions to Pluralsight, Inc. in an amount sufficient to cover cash dividends, if any, declared by us.\nDeterioration in the consolidated financial condition, earnings, or cash flow of Pluralsight Holdings for any reason could limit or impair its ability to pay cash distributions or other distributions to us. In addition, our ability to pay dividends in the future is dependent upon our receipt of cash from Pluralsight Holdings and its subsidiaries. Pluralsight Holdings and its subsidiaries may be restricted from distributing cash to us by, among other things, law or the documents governing our existing or future indebtedness.\nSome provisions of Delaware law and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may deter third parties from acquiring us and diminish the value of our Class A common stock.\nOur status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would benefit our existing stockholders. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide for, among other things:\n\u2022a classified board of directors with staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022the removal of directors by stockholders only for cause;\n\u2022our multi-class structure, which provides Aaron Skonnard, our co-founder, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman, personally and through his associated entities, the ability to control or significantly influence the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval;\n\u2022the ability of our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could have the effect of impeding the success of an attempt to acquire us or otherwise effect a change in control;\n\u2022advance notice for nominations of directors by stockholders and for stockholders to include matters to be considered at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022a prohibition on stockholders calling special stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws that may be amended only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds in voting power of all outstanding shares of our stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class.\nThese anti-takeover defenses could discourage, delay, or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company. These provisions could discourage proxy contests, make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing, and cause us to take other corporate actions they desire, any of which, under certain circumstances, could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our capital stock, and affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our Class A common stock.\nOur amended and restated bylaws designate a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that, for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, or other employees of ours or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws, or (iv) any other action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine, the exclusive forum shall be a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware, in substantially all cases. Our amended and restated bylaws also provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States shall be the sole and exclusive forum for any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to the Securities Act, such a provision known as a \u201cFederal Forum Provision.\u201d Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in our shares of capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to these provisions. These exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees.\nIn light of the decision issued by the Delaware Supreme Court in Salzburg et al. v. Matthew Sciabacucchi, No. 346, 2019 (Del.), finding Federal Forum Provisions are valid under Delaware law, which decision overruled the decision issued by the Delaware Court of Chancery in Matthew Sciabacucchi v. Matthew B. Salzberg et al., C.A. No. 2017-0931-JTL (Del. Ch.), we intend to enforce the Federal Forum Provision in our amended and restated bylaws.\nIf we face relevant litigation and are unable to enforce these provisions, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, or other catastrophic events.\nNatural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, and other adverse weather and climate conditions; unforeseen public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics; political crises, such as terrorist attacks, war, and other political instability; or other catastrophic events, whether occurring in the United States or internationally, could disrupt our operations in any of our offices or the operations of one or more of our third-party providers and vendors, such as AWS. To the extent any of these events occur, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nClimate change may have a long-term impact on our business.\nWe recognize that there are inherent climate related risks wherever business is conducted and we are exploring methods to mitigate business risks associated with climate change, including affiliations with organizations focused on reducing climate related risks and establishing sustainability initiatives. Access to clean water and reliable energy\nin the communities where we conduct our business, whether for our offices, data centers, vendors, customers or other stakeholders, is a priority and is not guaranteed. Any of our primary locations may be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. Climate-related events, including the increasing frequency of extreme weather events and their impact on critical infrastructure in the United States and elsewhere, have the potential to disrupt our business, our partners, and our customers, and may cause us to experience higher attrition, losses, and additional costs to maintain or resume operations.", "PERMNO": 17788, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "PS"}
