{"cik": "920371", "company": "Simpson Manufacturing Co., Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully review the following discussion of the risks that may affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the other information appearing in this report, for important information regarding risks that affect us. Current global economic events and conditions may amplify many of these risks. These risks are not the only risks that may affect us. Additional risks that we are not aware of or do not believe are material at the time of this filing, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business.\nGeneral Business Risks\nBusiness cycles and uncertainty regarding the housing market, economic conditions, political climate and other factors beyond our control could adversely affect demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business, and our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our total product sales is dependent on housing starts. Accordingly, our business, financial condition and results of operations depends significantly on the stability of the housing and residential construction and home improvement markets, which are affected by general economic and other factors that are beyond our control. These conditions include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nuncertainty about the housing and residential construction and home improvement markets;\n\u2022\nchanges in economic conditions or the political climate that adversely impact our customers\u2019 confidence or financial condition;\n\u2022\nunemployment and foreclosure rates;\n\u2022\ninventory loss;\n\u2022\ninterest rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\nraw material and energy costs;\n\u2022\nlabor and healthcare costs;\n\u2022\nthe availability of financing, or lack thereof, to builders, developers, and consumers;\n\u2022\nthe state of the credit markets, including mortgages and home equity loans;\n\u2022\nweather; natural disasters; and\n\u2022\nacts of terrorism.\nThese factors could adversely affect demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business, and our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, many of our customers in the construction industry are small and medium-sized businesses that are more likely to be adversely affected by economic downturns than larger, more established businesses. Uncertainty about current global economic conditions may cause these consumers to postpone or refrain from spending or may cause them to switch to lower-cost alternative products, which could reduce demand for our products and materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nAdditionally, declines in commercial and residential construction, such as housing starts and home improvement projects, which generally occur during economic downturns, have in the past significantly reduced, and in the future can be expected to reduce, the demand for our products and our stock price.\nWe may not be effective in achieving our stated strategic and operating objectives under our 2020 Plan.\nWe have been implementing a strategic plan, the 2020 Plan, centered on focusing on our organic growth, rationalizing our cost structure to improve profitability, improving our working capital management primarily through the reduction of inventory levels and other working capital items such as accounts payable and accounts receivable. While the strategy calls for increased emphasis on certain operational targets, such as growing our net sales, reducing our company-wide operating expenses as a percentage of net sales and decreasing our inventory levels, it moderates focus on other aspects of our operations that used to be part of our prior strategy, such as acquisitive growth (especially in the concrete space).\nThere can be no guarantee that the 2020 Plan will yield the results that we currently anticipate or results that will exceed those that might have been obtained under our prior strategy if we fail to successfully execute on one or more prongs of the 2020 Plan, even if we successfully implement one or more other prongs.\nThe successful execution of the 2020 Plan depends on, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022Maintain our top-line growth and achieve a net sales compound annual growth rate of approximately 8%\nfrom fiscal 2016 through the end of fiscal 2020 by gaining market share in certain products lines;\n\u2022Carry out effective cost reduction measures in Europe and our concrete product line and by fiscal 2020,\nreduce our company-wide operating expenses as a percent of net sales to be below or at 27%;\n\u25e6\nEliminate at least 25% to 30% of our product SKUs, implement Lean principles in our factories, and achieve an additional 30% reduction of our raw materials and finished goods inventory by fiscal 2020.\nAlthough we have made progress on meeting 2020 Plan targets, we may not be able to achieve all of our goals of the 2020 Plan due to any number of reasons. We revised several objectives of the 2020 Plan in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2019. Going forward, we may choose to further refine our strategic and operating objectives, update our current strategic goals under the 2020 Plan, and pursue strategies outside the 2020 Plan that we believe represent great opportunities due to changes in our business, operations, financial conditions and other factors beyond our control.\nOur sales are seasonal and we have little control over the timing of customer purchases. If we miss seasonal forecasts or customers purchase our products in different quarters than we or analysts expect, our stock price could materially decline.\nOur sales are seasonal, with operating results varying from quarter to quarter. With some exceptions, our sales and income have historically been lower in the first and fourth quarters than in the second and third quarters, as customers tend to purchase construction materials in the late spring and summer months for the construction season. In addition, weather conditions, such as unseasonably warm, cold or wet weather, which affect, and sometimes delay or accelerate installation of some of our products, may significantly affect our results of operations. Sales that we anticipate in one quarter may occur in another quarter, affecting both quarters\u2019 results and potentially our stock price.\nIn addition, we typically ship orders as we receive them and maintain inventory levels to allow us to operate with little backlog. The efficiency of our inventory system, and our ability to avoid backlogs and potential loss of customers, is closely tied to our ability to accurately predict seasonal and quarterly variances. Further, our planned expenditures are also based primarily on sales forecasts. When sales do not meet our expectations, our operating results will be reduced for the relevant quarters, as we will have already incurred expenses based on those expectations. This could result in a material decline in our stock price.\nWe operate in a competitive industry, and if we fail to anticipate and react appropriately to competitors, technological changes, changing industry trends and other competitive forces, our sales and profit margins will decline.\nIn order to effectively compete, we must be able to meet changing market conditions and develop enhancements to our existing products or new products on a timely basis in order to maintain our competitive advantage. Our continued growth depends upon our ability to develop additional products, services and technologies that meet our customers\u2019 expectation of our brand and quality. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing and marketing new products, product enhancements and additional technologies, that we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of these products, or that our new products and product enhancements will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or will achieve market acceptance.\nFurther, one of the core elements of our strategy is to provide high quality products and a high level of customer services. Many of our competitors are dedicating increasing resources to competing with us, especially as our products and services become more affected by technological advances and software innovations. Some of our competitors have more experience producing software and other technology-driven solutions. As a result, we are dedicating increasing resources to research and development in new and changing technologies in order to stay competitive and provide high quality and innovative products and services. These increased expenditures could reduce our operating results.\nAdditionally, our ability to compete effectively depends, to a significant extent, on the specification or approval of our products by architects, engineers, building inspectors, building code officials and customers and their acceptance of our premium brand. If a significant segment of those communities were to decide that the design, materials, manufacturing, testing or quality control of our products is inferior to that of any of our competitors or the cost differences between our products and any competitors are not justifiable, our sales and profits would be materially reduced.\nOur future growth may depend on our ability to develop new products and penetrate new markets, which could reduce our profitability.\nOur future success depends upon our continued investment in research and development and our ability to continue to develop new products that allow us to expand our product offerings and enter into new markets. Expansion into new markets and the development of new products may involve considerable costs and may not generate sufficient revenue to be profitable or cover the costs of development. We might not be able to penetrate these product markets and any market penetration that occurs might not be timely or profitable. We may be unable to recoup part or all of the significant investments we make in attempting to develop new products and penetrate new markets.\nProduct, Services and Sales Risks\nProduct liability claims and litigation could affect our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe products that we design and/or manufacture, and/or the services we provide, can lead to product liability claims or other legal claims being filed against us. To the extent that plaintiffs are successful in showing that a defect in a product\u2019s design, manufacture or warnings led to personal injury or property damage, or that our provision of services resulted in similar injury or damage, we may be subject to claims for damages. Although we are insured for damages above a certain amount, we bear the costs and expenses associated with defending claims, including frivolous lawsuits, and are responsible for damages up to the insurance retention amount. In addition to claims concerning individual products, as a manufacturer, we can be subject to costs, potential negative publicity and lawsuits related to product recalls, which could adversely impact our results of operations and damage our reputation.\nDesign defects, labeling defects, product formula defects, inaccurate chemical mixes, product recalls and/or product liability claims could harm our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have on occasion found flaws and deficiencies in the design, manufacturing, assembling, labeling, product formulations, chemical mixes or testing of our products. We also have on occasion found flaws and deficiencies in raw materials and finished goods produced by others and used with or incorporated into our products. Some flaws and deficiencies have not been apparent until after the products were installed or used by customers.\nMany of our products are integral to the structural soundness or safety of the structures in which they are used. If any flaws or deficiencies exist in our products and if such flaws or deficiencies are not discovered and corrected before our products are incorporated into structures, the structures could be unsafe or could suffer severe damage, such as collapse or fire, and personal injury or death could result. Errors in the installation of our products, even if the products are free of flaws and deficiencies, could also cause personal injury or death and unsafe structural conditions. To the extent that such damage or injury is not covered by our product liability insurance and we are held to be liable, we could be required to correct such damage and to compensate persons who might have suffered injury or death, and our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nEven if a flaw or deficiency is discovered before any damage or injury occurs, we may need to refund customers and/or repair or recall products (to the extent possible), and we may be liable for any costs necessary to replace recalled products or retrofit or remedy the affected structures. Any such recall, retrofit or other remedy could entail substantial costs and adversely affect our reputation, sales and financial condition. We do not carry insurance against recall costs or the adverse business effect of a recall, and our product liability insurance may not cover retrofit or other remedy costs.\nAs a result of the nature of many of our products and their use in construction projects, claims (including product warranty claims and claims resulting from a natural disaster) may be made against us with regard to damage or destruction of structures incorporating our products whether or not our products failed. Any such claims, if asserted, could require us to expend material time and efforts defending the claim and may materially and adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Costs associated with resolving such claims (such as repair or replacement of the affected parts) could be material and may exceed any amounts reserved in our consolidated financial statements.\nWhile we generally attempt to limit our contractual liability and our exposure to price or expense increases, we may have uncapped liabilities or significant exposure under some contracts, and could suffer material losses under such contracts.\nWe enter into many types of contracts with our customers, suppliers and other third parties, including in connection with our expansion into new markets and new product lines. Under some of these contracts, our overall liability may not be limited to a specified maximum amount or we may have significant potential exposure to price or expense increases. If we receive claims under these contracts or experience significant price increases or comparable expense increases, we may incur liabilities significantly in excess of the revenues associated with such contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nSome of our technology offerings provide planning and design functions to customers, and we are involved both in product sales and engineering services. Any software errors or deficiencies or failures in our engineering services could have material adverse effects on our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows\nOur planning/design software applications facilitate the creation by customers of complex construction and building designs. Our software is extremely complex and is continually being modified and improved. As a result, it may contain defects or errors and new versions may introduce new defects and errors. While we have attempted to limit our potential liability for the failure of any planning/designs created with the use of our software applications, as a result of defects in our software, the structures could be unsafe or could suffer severe damage, such as collapse or fire, and personal injury or death could result. Errors in construction not related to the plans/designs created with the use of our software applications could also cause personal injury or death and unsafe structural conditions, even if our software functioned properly. To the extent that a structure designed by our software suffers any failure or deficiency, we could be required to correct deficiencies and may become involved in litigation, even if our software was not the cause of such deficiency. Further, if any damage or injury is not covered by our insurance and we are held to be liable, we could be required to correct such damage and to compensate persons who might have suffered injury, and our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nWhile we engage in testing and upgrades, there can be no assurance that, despite our testing and upgrades, errors will not be found in new and existing products resulting in loss of revenues or delay in market acceptance, diversion of development resources, damage to our reputation, adverse litigation, or increased service and warranty costs, any of which would have a material adverse effect upon our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe are also involved in providing engineering solutions to our clients. The risks associated with providing these services are materially different than the risks we historically faced when we only manufactured products. If our engineers prepare, approve or seal drawings that contain defects or otherwise are involved in any design or construction that contains flaws, regardless of whether our engineers caused such flaws, we may be held liable for professional negligence or other damages, which could involve material claims. Although we are insured for damages above a certain amount, we bear the costs and expenses associated with defending claims, including frivolous lawsuits, and are responsible for damages up to the insurance retention amount. In addition to claims concerning individual engineering solutions, as a service provider, we can be subject to costs, potential negative publicity and lawsuits related to construction design or engineering defects, which could adversely impact our results of operations and damage our reputation.\nWe have a few large customers, the loss of any one of which could negatively affect our sales and profits.\nOur largest customers accounted for a significant portion of net sales for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017. Any reduction in, or termination of, our sales to these customers would at least temporarily, and possibly on a longer term basis, cause a material reduction in our net sales, income from operations and net income. Such a reduction in or elimination of our sales to any of our largest customers would increase our relative dependence on our remaining large customers.\nIn addition, our distributor customers and builders have increasingly consolidated over time, which has increased the material adverse effect of losing any one of them and may increase their bargaining power in negotiations with us. These trends could negatively affect our sales and profitability.\nIncreases in prices of raw materials and energy could negatively affect our sales and profits.\nSteel is the principal raw material used in the manufacture of our products. Import tariffs and/or other mandates imposed by the current presidential administration could potentially lead to a trade war with other foreign governments, and could significantly increase the prices on raw materials that are critical to our business, such as steel. In addition, even in the absence of the current tariffs the price of steel has historically fluctuated on a cyclical basis and has often depended on a variety of factors over which we have no control. The cost of producing our products is also sensitive to the price of energy. The selling prices of our products have not always increased in response to raw material, energy or other cost increases, and we are unable to determine to what extent, if any, we will be able to pass future cost increases through our customers. Our inability to pass increased costs through to our customers could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe depend on third parties for transportation services and the lack of availability of transportation and/or increases in cost could materially and adversely affect our business and operations.\nOur business depends on the transportation of both finished goods to our customers and distributors and the transportation of raw materials to us. We rely on third parties for transportation services of these items, which services are occasionally in high demand (especially at the end of calendar quarters) and/or subject to price fluctuations.\nIf the required supply of transportation services is unavailable when needed, our manufacturing processes may be interrupted if we are not able to receive raw materials or we may be unable to sell our products at full value, or at all. This could harm our reputation,\nnegatively impact our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, a material increase in transportation rates or fuel surcharges could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.\nTechnological and Intellectual Property Risks\nOur recent efforts to increase our technology offerings and integrate new software and application offerings may prove unsuccessful and may affect our future prospects.\nOur industry has experienced increased complexity in some home design and builders are more aggressively trying to reduce their costs. One of our responses has been to develop and market sophisticated software and applications to facilitate the specification and marketing of our product systems. We have continued to commit substantial resources to our software development endeavors in recent years and expect that trend to continue in 2020.\nWe have a limited operating history in the technology space and may not be able to create commercially successful software and applications. Even if we are able to create initially successful ideas, the technology industry is subject to rapid changes. We may not be able to adapt quickly enough to keep up with changing demands, and our software may become obsolete.\nWhile we see having a software interface with the construction industry as a potential growth area, we also face competition from other companies that are focused solely or primarily on the development of software and applications. These companies may have significantly greater expertise and resources to devote to software development, and we may be unable to compete with them in that space.\nIf we cannot protect our technology, we will not be able to compete effectively.\nOur ability to compete effectively with other companies depends in part on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology, in part through patents, copyrights, trade secrets and other intellectual property protections. We might not be able to protect or rely on our patents and copyrights. Patents might not issue pursuant to pending patent applications. Our software copyright and other protections might not be adequate to protect our software and application code. Others might independently develop the same or similar technology, develop around the patented aspects of any of our products or proposed products, or otherwise obtain access to or circumvent our proprietary technology. We also rely on unpatented proprietary technology to maintain our competitive position. We might not be able to protect our trade secrets, our know-how or other proprietary information. If we are unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our intellectual property, our sales and profits are likely to be materially reduced.\nIn attempting to protect our intellectual property, we sometimes initiate lawsuits against competitors and others that we believe have infringed or are infringing our intellectual property rights. In such an event, the defendant may assert counterclaims to complicate or delay the litigation or for other reasons. Litigation may be very costly and may result in adverse judgments that affect our sales and profits materially and adversely.\nClaims that we infringe intellectual property rights of others may materially increase our expenses and reduce our profits.\nOther parties have in the past and may in the future claim that our products or processes infringe their intellectual property rights. We may incur substantial costs and liabilities in investigating, defending and resolving such claims, whether or not they are meritorious, which may materially reduce our profitability and materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition. Litigation can be disruptive to normal business operations and may result in adverse rulings or decisions. If any such infringement claim is asserted against us, we may be required to obtain a license or cross-license, modify our existing technology or design a new non-infringing technology, any of which could be costly and time-consuming. A ruling against us in an infringement lawsuit could include an injunction barring our production or sale of any infringing product. A damages award against us could include an award of royalties or lost profits and, if the court finds willful infringement, treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees.\nWe are subject to cyber security risks and may incur increasing costs in efforts to minimize those risks and to comply with regulatory standards.\nWe employ information technology systems and operate websites which allow for the secure storage and transmission of proprietary or confidential information regarding our customers, employees and others. We make significant efforts to secure our computer network to mitigate the risk of possible cyber-attacks, including, but not limited to, data breaches, and are continuously working to upgrade our existing information technology systems to ensure that we are protected, to the greatest extent possible, against cyber risks and security breaches. Despite these efforts security of our computer networks could be compromised which could impact operations and\nconfidential information could be misappropriated, which could lead to negative publicity, loss of sales and profits or cause us to incur significant costs to reimburse third- parties for damages, which could adversely impact profits.\nAdditionally, we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous regulatory standards enacted to protect businesses and personal data, including the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) and the California Consumer Privacy Act. GDPR is a comprehensive European Union privacy and data protection reform, effective in 2018, which applies to companies that are organized in the European Union or otherwise provide services to consumers who reside in the European Union, and imposes strict standards regarding the sharing, storage, use, disclosure and protection of end user data and significant penalties (monetary and otherwise) for non-compliance. The California Consumer Privacy Act creates new data privacy rights, effective in 2020. Any failure to comply with GDPR, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or other regulatory standards, could subject the Company to legal and reputational risks. Misuse of or failure to secure personal information could also result in violation of data privacy laws and regulations, proceedings against us by governmental entities or others, damage to our reputation and credibility, and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe have experienced and may in the future experience delays, outages, cyber-based attacks or security breaches in relation to our information systems and computer networks, which have disrupted and may in the future disrupt our operations and may result in data corruption. As a result, our profitability, financial condition and reputation could be negatively affected. In addition, data privacy statements and laws could subject us to liability.\nWe depend on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information. We depend on our information technology infrastructure for electronic communications among our locations around the world and between our personnel and our subsidiaries, customers and suppliers. We collect and retain large volumes of internal and customer, vendor and supplier data, including some personally identifiable information, for business purposes. We also maintain personally identifiable information about our employees. The integrity and protection of our customer, vendor, supplier, employee and other Company data is critical to our business. The regulatory environment governing information, security and privacy laws is increasingly demanding and continues to evolve. Maintaining compliance with applicable security and privacy regulations may increase our operating costs or adversely affect our business operations.\nDespite the security and maintenance measures we have in place, our facilities and systems, and those of the retailers, dealers, licensees and other third-parties with which we do business, we remain vulnerable to security breaches, cyber-attacks, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, malware, data corruption, delays, disruptions, programming and/or human errors or other similar events, such as those accomplished through fraud, trickery or other forms of deceiving our employees, contractors or other agents or representatives and those due to system updates, natural disasters, malicious attacks, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins or similar events. Such incidents have occurred, continue to occur, and may occur in the future.\nSecurity breaches of our infrastructure could create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosures of confidential information. Despite the security measures we have in place, our facilities and systems, and those of the retailers, dealers, licensees and other third parties with which we do business, we may be vulnerable to security breaches, cyber-attacks, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or other similar events. Such incidents may involve misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential data, materials or information, including those concerning our customers, employees or suppliers, whether by us or by the retailers, dealers, licensees and other third-party distributors with which we do business, disrupt our operations, result in losses, damage our reputation, and expose us to the risks of litigation and liability (including regulatory liability); and may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe publicly post our privacy policies and practices concerning our processing, use, and disclosure of personally identifiable information on our website. If we fail to adhere to our privacy policy and other published statements or applicable laws concerning our processing, use, transmission and disclosure of protected information, or if our statements or practices are found to be deceptive or misrepresentative, we could face regulatory actions, fines and other liability.\nWe may experience delays or outages in our information technology system and computer networks.\nWe may be subject to information technology system failures and network disruptions. These may be caused by delays or disruptions due to system updates, natural disasters, malicious attacks, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins or similar events or disruptions.\nDespite our security measures, our systems could be vulnerable to disruption, and any such disruption could negatively affect our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSome of our agreements for software and software-as-services products have limited terms, and we may be unable to renew such agreements and may lose access to such products.\nWe have various agreements with a number of third parties that provide software and software-as-service products to us. These agreements often require reoccurring payments for online access to the products and have limited terms. In the future, we will be required to renegotiate the terms of these agreements, and may be unable to renew such agreements on favorable terms. If any such agreement cannot be renewed or can only be renewed on terms that are materially worse for us, we may be unable to access the applicable software, and our business and operating results may be adversely affected.\nRegulatory Risks\nFailure to comply with industry regulations could result in reduced sales and increased costs.\nWe are subject to environmental laws and regulations governing emissions into the air, discharges into water, and generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials. We are also subject to other federal and state laws and regulations regarding health and safety matters.\nOur manufacturing operations involve the use of solvents, chemicals, oils and other materials that are regarded as hazardous or toxic. We also use complex and heavy machinery and equipment that can pose severe safety hazards, especially if not properly and carefully used. Some of our products also incorporate materials that are hazardous or toxic in some forms, such as:\n\u2022zinc and lead used in some steel galvanizing processes;\n\u2022chemicals used in our acrylic and epoxy anchoring products, and our concrete repair, strengthening and\nprotecting products; and\n\u2022gun powder used in our powder-actuated tools, which is explosive.\nWe have in the past, and may in the future, need to take steps to remedy our failure to properly label, store, transport, use and manufacture such toxic and hazardous materials.\nIf we do not obtain all material licenses and permits required by environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we may be subject to regulatory action by governmental authorities. If our policies and procedures are flawed, or our employees fail or neglect to follow our policies and procedures in all respects, we might incur liability. Relevant laws and regulations could change or new ones could be adopted that require us to incur substantial expense to comply.\nComplying or failing to comply with conflict minerals regulations could materially and adversely affect our supply chain, our relationships with customers and suppliers and our financial results.\nWe are currently subject to conflict mineral disclosure regulations in the U.S. and may be affected by new regulations concerning conflict and similar minerals adopted by other jurisdictions where we operate. While we have been successful to date in adapting to such regulations, we have and will continue to incur added costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of such minerals used in our products. We may not be able to ascertain the origins of such minerals that we use and may not be able to satisfy requests from customers to certify that our products are free of conflict minerals. These requirements also could constrain the pool of suppliers from which we source such minerals. We may be unable to obtain conflict-free minerals at competitive prices. Such consequences will increase costs and may materially and adversely affect our manufacturing operations and profitability.\nWhen we provide engineering services we are subject to various local, state and federal rules and regulations which can increase our potential liability.\nAs part of our product offerings, we may provide engineering and design-related services to our clients. Some of these services require us to stamp drawings or otherwise be involved in the engineering process. While we generally attempt to limit our liability through our internal processes and through our legal agreements with third parties to which we provide such services, under various local, state and federal rules and regulations these limitations may not be effective and we may be held liable for engineering failures. Any such liability could materially and adversely affect our profitability.\nCapital Expenditures, Expansions, Acquisitions and Divestitures Risks\nOur acquisition activities, if any, present unique risks for our business, and any acquisition could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nAlthough it is not as important to our strategy as it has been in the past, we may consider and evaluate acquisitions and we compete for acquisitions with other potential acquirers, some of which may have greater financial or operational resources than we do. As a result, we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or strategic opportunities. Any acquisitions we undertake involve numerous risks, including, for example:\n\u2022inadequate access to information and/or due diligence of acquired businesses;\n\u2022diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022overvaluation of acquired businesses;\n\u2022difficulties integrating the operations and products of acquired businesses, including expensive and time\nconsuming integration costs such as employee redeployment, relocation or severance, combining teams and processes in various functional areas, reorganization or closures of facilities, and relocation or disposition of excess equipment;\n\u2022inaccurate accounting or public reporting arising from integration of the financial statements and disclosures of\nacquired businesses;\n\u2022undisclosed existing or potential liabilities of acquired businesses;\n\u2022slow acceptance or rejection of acquired businesses\u2019 products by our customers;\n\u2022risks of entering markets in which we have little or no prior experience;\n\u2022litigation involving activities, properties or products of acquired businesses;\n\u2022increased cost of regulatory compliance and enforcement;\n\u2022consumer and other claims related to products of acquired businesses; and\n\u2022the potential loss of key employees of acquired businesses.\nIn addition, future acquisitions may involve issuance of additional equity securities that dilute the value of our existing equity securities, increase our debt, cause impairment related to goodwill and cause impairment of, and amortization expenses related to, other intangible assets, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability. Any acquisition could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results, and as a result, our business and operating results may differ from any guidance that we may provide.\nOur capital expenditures may not be adequate to maintain our competitive position and may not be implemented in a timely or cost-effective manner.\nOur capital expenditures are limited by our liquidity and capital resources and the amount we have available for capital spending is limited by the need to pay our other expenses and to maintain adequate cash reserves and borrowing capacity to meet unexpected demands that may arise. Productivity improvements through process re-engineering, design efficiency and manufacturing cost improvements may be required to offset potential increases in labor and raw material costs and competitive price pressures. If we are unable to make sufficient capital expenditures, or to maximize the efficiency of the capital expenditures we do make, our competitive position may be harmed and we may be unable to manufacture the products necessary to compete successfully in our targeted market segments.\nAdditional financing, if needed, to fund our working capital, growth or other business requirements may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all.\nIf the cash needed for working capital or to fund our growth or other business requirements increases to a level that exceeds the amount of cash that we generate from operations and have available through our current credit arrangements, we will need to seek additional financing. Additional or new borrowings may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all. Our ability to raise money by issuing and selling shares of our common or preferred stock depends on general market conditions and the demand for our stock. If we sell stock, our existing stockholders could experience substantial dilution. Our inability to secure additional financing could prevent the expansion of our business, internally and through acquisitions.\nInternational Operations Risks\nInternational operations and our financial results in those markets may be affected by legal, regulatory, political, currency exchange and other economic risks.\nDuring 2019, revenue from sales outside of the United States was $214.8 million, representing approximately 19% of consolidated sales. In addition, a significant amount of our manufacturing and production operations are located outside the United States. As a result, our business is subject to risks associated with international operations. These risks include the burdens of complying with foreign laws and regulations, unexpected changes in tariffs, taxes or regulatory requirements, political unrest and corruption, local acceptance of our products, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, currency controls, and cash repatriation restrictions. Regulatory changes could occur in the countries in which we sell, produce or source our products or significantly increase the cost of operating in or obtaining materials originating from certain countries. Restrictions imposed by such changes can have a particular impact on our business when, after we have moved our operations to a particular location, new unfavorable regulations are enacted in that area or favorable regulations currently in effect are changed.\nCountries in which our products are manufactured or sold may from time to time impose additional new regulations, or modify existing regulations, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in duties, taxes, tariffs and other charges on imports;\n\u2022\nrequirements as to where products and/or inputs are manufactured or sourced;\n\u2022\ncreation of export licensing requirements, imposition of restrictions on export quantities or specifications of minimum export pricing/and or export prices or duties;\n\u2022\nlimitations on foreign owned business; or\n\u2022\ngovernment actions to cancel contracts, re-denominate the official currency, renounce or default on obligations, renegotiate terms unilaterally or expropriate assets.\nIn addition, political and economic changes or volatility, geopolitical regional conflicts, terrorist activity, political unrest, civil strife, acts of war, public corruption and other economic or political uncertainties could interrupt and negatively affect our business operations. All of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased revenues and could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, international construction standards, techniques and methods differ from those in the United States and as a result, we may need to redesign our products, or invent or design new products, to compete effectively and profitably in international markets. Inflation in emerging markets may also make our products more expensive there and increases the market and credit risks that we are exposed to.\nWe are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, in addition to the anti-corruption laws of the foreign countries in which we operate. Although we implement policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws, our employees, contractors and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, may take actions in violation of our policies. Any such violation could result in sanctions or other penalties and have an adverse effect on our business, reputation and operating results.\nFailure to comply with export, import, and sanctions laws and regulations could affect us materially and adversely.\nWe are subject to a number of export, import and economic sanction regulations, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (\u201cITAR\u201d), the Export Administration Regulations (\u201cEAR\u201d) and U.S. sanction regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets (\u201cOFAC\u201d). Foreign governments where we have operations also implement export, import and sanction laws and regulations, some of which may be inconsistent or conflict with ITAR and EAR. Where we face such inconsistencies, it may be impossible for us to comply with all applicable regulations.\nIf we do not obtain all necessary import and export licenses required by applicable export and import regulations, including ITAR and EAR, or do business with sanctioned countries or individuals, we may be subject to fines, penalties and other regulatory action by governmental authorities, including, among other things, having our export or import privileges suspended. Even if our policies and procedures for exports, imports and sanction regulations comply, but our employees fail or neglect to follow them in all respects, we might incur similar liability.\nAny changes in applicable export, import or sanction laws or regulations or any legal or regulatory violations could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOur manufacturing facilities in China complicate our supply and inventory management.\nWe maintain manufacturing capability in various parts of the world, including Jiangsu, China, in part to allow us to serve our customers with prompt delivery of needed products. In recent years, we have significantly expanded our manufacturing capabilities in China. Substantially all of our manufacturing output in China was and is currently intended for export to other parts of the world. If a widespread outbreak of an illness or other health issues, such as the Wuhan Coronavirus outbreak occurred in the area where our\nJiangsu, China manufacturing facility is located, it could substantially interfere with our general commercial activity related to our supply chain and customer base, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects. If this outbreak causes us to curtail our operations, we may need to seek alternative sources of supply for products for our customers, which may increase the costs to manufacture and deliver our products.\nCustomer service is a significant component in our efforts to compete with larger companies that have greater resources than we have. Because of the great distances between our manufacturing facilities in China and the markets to which our products will be shipped, any factors that adversely impact our ability to timely deliver products to our customers, including but not limited to government-imposed work restrictions and restrictions on travel, may delay delivery to our customers, which will put us at a competitive disadvantage. Our attempts to provide prompt delivery may necessitate that in China, we produce and keep on hand substantially more inventory of finished products than would otherwise be needed. Inventory fluctuations can materially and adversely affect our margins, cash flow and profits. Any tariffs, duties, taxes, penalties imposed by the United States on imports from China would negatively affect our inventory management and profits.\nIf significant tariffs or other restrictions are placed on our imports or any related counter-measures are taken by other countries, our costs of doing business, revenue and results of operations may be negatively impacted.\nIf significant tariffs or other restrictions are placed on Chinese or other imports or any related counter-measures are taken by China or other countries, our costs of doing business, revenue and results of operations may be materially harmed. If duties are imposed on our imports, we may be required to raise our prices, which may result in the loss of customers and harm our operating performance. Alternatively, we may seek to shift production outside of China, resulting in significant costs and disruption to our operations as we would need to pursue the time-consuming processes of recreating a new supply chain, identifying substitute components and establishing new manufacturing locations. .\nWe are subject to U.S. and international tax laws that could affect our financial results.\nWe generally conduct international operations through our wholly-owned subsidiaries. Our income tax liabilities in the different countries where we operate depend in part on internal settlement prices and administrative charges among us and our subsidiaries. These arrangements require us to make judgments with which tax authorities may disagree. Tax authorities may impose additional tariffs, duties, taxes, penalties and interest on us. Transactions that we have arranged in light of current tax rules could have material and adverse consequences if tax rules change, and changes in tax rules or imposition of any new or increased tariffs, duties and taxes could materially and adversely affect our sales, profits and financial condition.\nTax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations are issued or applied. If the U.S. or other foreign tax authorities change applicable tax laws, our overall taxes could increase, and our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nCapital Structure Risks\nAny issuance of preferred stock may dilute your investment and reduce funds available for dividends.\nOur Board of Directors is authorized by our Certificate of Incorporation to determine the terms of one or more series of preferred stock and to authorize the issuance of shares of any such series on such terms as our Board of Directors may approve. Any such issuance could be used to impede an acquisition of our business that our Board of Directors does not approve, further dilute the equity investments of holders of our common stock and reduce funds available for the payment of dividends to holders of our common stock.\nDelaware law and our corporate governance documents could deter takeover attempts that might otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders.\nProvisions of Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us. Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may make the acquisition of the Company more difficult for potential acquirers by prohibiting stockholders holding 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock from acquiring us without the consent of our Board of Directors for at least three years from the date they first hold 15% or more of the voting stock.\nPursuant to the Company\u2019s current corporate governance documents, our stockholders cannot call special meetings and cannot take action by written consent. In addition, a change in the composition of our Board of Directors that is not approved by the existing Board of Directors could trigger a default under our existing credit facilities.\nThese provisions may discourage, delay or make difficult a merger or acquisition of the Company, including a transaction that may offer a premium price for our common stock.\nEmployee Risks\nWe depend on executives and other key employees, the loss of whom could harm our business.\nWe depend, in part, on the efforts and skills of our executives and other key employees, including members of our sales force. Our executives and key employees are experienced and highly qualified. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees could harm the business and the Company\u2019s ability to timely achieve its strategic initiatives. Our success also depends on our ability to identify, attract, hire and retain our key personnel. We face strong competition for such personnel and may not be able to attract or retain such personnel. In addition, when we experience periods with little or no profits, a decrease in compensation based on our profits may make it difficult to attract and retain highly qualified personnel. We may not be able to attract and retained key personnel or may incur significant costs in order to do so.\nOur work force could become increasingly unionized in the future and our unionized or union-free work force could strike, which could adversely affect the stability of our production and reduce our profitability.\nA significant number of our employees are represented by labor unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements that will expire between 2021 and 2023. Generally, collective bargaining agreements that expire may be terminated after notice by the union. After termination, the union may authorize a strike similar to the strike which was initiated at our Stockton, California facility in the third quarter of 2019. Although we believe that our relations with our employees are generally good, no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements as they expire. If we fail to extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements, if disputes with our unions arise, or if the workers covered by one or more of the collective bargaining agreements engage in a strike, lockout, or other work stoppage, we could have a material adverse effect on production at one or more of our facilities, incur higher labor costs, and, depending upon the length of such dispute or work stoppage, on our business, results of operations, financial position and liquidity.\nOther Risks\nNatural disasters could decrease our manufacturing capacity.\nSome of our current manufacturing facilities are located in geographic regions that have experienced major natural disasters, such as earthquakes, floods and hurricanes. Our disaster recovery plan may not be adequate or effective. We do not carry earthquake insurance. Other insurance that we carry is limited in the risks covered and the amount of coverage. Our insurance would not be adequate to cover all of our resulting costs, business interruption and lost profits when a major natural disaster occurs. A natural disaster rendering one or more of our manufacturing facilities totally or partially inoperable, whether or not covered by insurance, would materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nClimate change could materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe cannot predict the effects that climate change may have on our business. They might, for example:\n\u2022depress or reverse economic development,\n\u2022reduce the demand for construction,\n\u2022increasing the cost and reducing the availability of wood products used in construction,\n\u2022increase the cost and reduce the availability of raw materials and energy,\n\u2022increase the cost and reduce the availability of insurance covering damage from natural disasters, and\n\u2022lead to new laws and regulations that increase our expenses and reduce our sales.\nAny of these consequences, and other consequences of climate change that we do not foresee, could materially and adversely affect our sales, profits and financial condition.\nSignificant judgment and certain estimates are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. Future tax law changes may materially increase the Company\u2019s prospective income tax expense.\nWe are subject to income taxation in the U.S. as well as numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision and, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.\nAlthough we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \u201cTax Reform Act\u201d) was signed into law. The impact of the Tax Reform Act and any future Treasury rules, regulations or guidance thereunder on our business and our stockholders is uncertain and could be adverse and cause our future results of operations and financial condition to differ materially from our expectations, estimates and assumptions disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nImpairment charges on goodwill or other intangible assets adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nWe are required to perform impairment tests on our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and definite-lived intangible assets annually or at any time when events occur that could affect the value of such assets. To determine whether a goodwill impairment has occurred, we compare fair value of each of our reporting units with its carrying value. In the past, these tests have led us to incur significant impairment charges. Significant and unanticipated changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in business climate, adverse actions by regulatory authorities, unanticipated competition, loss of key customers or changes in technology or markets, can require a charge for impairment that can materially and adversely affect our reported net income and our stockholders\u2019 equity.\nWe rely on complex software systems and hosted applications to operate our business, and our business may be disrupted if we are unable to successfully/efficiently update these systems or convert to new systems.\nWe are increasingly dependent on technology systems to operate our business, reduce costs, and enhance customer service. These systems include complex software systems and hosted applications that are provided by third parties such as financial management and human capital management platforms from SAP America, Inc. and Workday, Inc. Software systems need to be updated on a regular basis with patches, bug fixes and other modifications. Hosted applications are subject to service availability and reliability of hosting environments. We also migrate from legacy systems to new systems from time to time. Maintaining existing software systems, implementing upgrades and converting to new systems are costly and require a significant allocation of personnel and other resources. The implementation of these systems upgrades and conversions is a complex and time-consuming project involving substantial expenditures for implementation activities, consultants, system hardware and software, often requires transforming our current business and financial processes to conform to new systems, and therefore, may take longer, be more disruptive, and cost more than forecast and may not be successful. If the implementation is delayed or otherwise is not successful, it may hinder our business operations and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. There are many factors that may materially and adversely affect the schedule, cost, and execution of the implementation process, including, without limitation, problems during the design and testing phases of new systems; system delays and malfunctions; the deviation by suppliers and contractors from the required performance under their contracts with us; the diversion of management attention from our daily operations to the implementation project; reworks due to unanticipated changes in business processes; difficulty in training employees in the operation of new systems and maintaining internal control while converting from legacy systems to new systems; and integration with our existing systems. Some of such factors may not be reasonably anticipated or may be beyond our control.\nFailure of our internal control over financial reporting or our accounting systems could harm our business and financial results.\nBecause of the inherent limitations of internal control, our internal control over financial reporting might not detect or prevent misstatements of our consolidated financial statements on a timely basis. We have used accounting and other financial management software systems in connection with our operations. Defects in such systems or their implementation could result in errors in our consolidated financial statements. Our growth and entry into globally dispersed markets as well as periodic conversions from legacy software systems to new software systems puts significant additional pressure on our internal control. Failure to maintain an effective internal control could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately or to detect and prevent deficiencies timely, cause investors to lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, and subject us to regulatory investigations and litigation. As a result, our business and the market price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected.\nChanges in accounting standards could materially and adversely affect our financial results.\nThe accounting rules applicable to public companies are subject to frequent revision. Future changes in accounting standards, guidance and interpretations could require us to change the way we measure revenue, expense or balance sheet amounts, which could result in material and adverse change to our reported results of operations or financial condition.", "PERMNO": 80575, "SIC": 3420, "TIC": "SSD"}
