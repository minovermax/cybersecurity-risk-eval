{"cik": "230557", "company": "SELECTIVE INSURANCE GROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nCertain risk factors can significantly impact our business, liquidity, capital resources, results of operations, financial condition, and debt ratings. These risk factors might affect, alter, or change actions we might take executing our long-term capital strategy. Examples include, without limitation, contributing capital to any or all of the Insurance Subsidiaries, issuing additional debt and/or equity securities, repurchasing our existing debt and/or equity securities, or increasing or decreasing common stockholders\u2019 dividends. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge\nfrom time to time. Consequently, we can neither predict such new risk factors nor assess the potential future impact, if any, they might have on our business.\nRisks Related to our Insurance Operations\nWe are subject to losses from catastrophic events.\nLosses from natural and human-made catastrophes can negatively impact our financial results. Examples include, without limitation, hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, severe convective storms, severe winter weather, derechos, floods, and fires, some related to climate change, and criminal and terrorist acts, including cyber-attacks, civil unrest, and explosions. The frequency and severity of these catastrophes are inherently unpredictable, and the frequency and severity of catastrophe losses have increased globally in recent years. Although we use sophisticated catastrophe modeling techniques to manage our catastrophe exposure, catastrophe models provide estimates, and actual exposure and loss experience may materially differ. For example, catastrophe models did not fully estimate the potential for some recent catastrophe loss activity (such as the Texas freeze in March of 2021 and Hurricane Ida-related severe flooding in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast) and the concurrent recent economic inflation on construction costs. Unmodeled or under-modeled catastrophe risks could result in understated catastrophe exposure and our actual catastrophe losses could be higher.\nOur insurance operations primarily write risks in the Eastern, Midwestern, and Southwestern regions of the U.S. Our most significant natural and/or human made catastrophe exposures are (i) hurricanes impacting the Eastern U.S., (ii) severe convective storms, including hailstorms and tornadoes, (iii) winter storms, and (iv) terrorism events. Single storms could adversely impact our financial results, but it is also possible that we could experience more than one severe catastrophic event in any given calendar year. We track our severe weather and catastrophe losses using definitions and information we obtain from ISO\u2019s Property Claim Services unit, an internationally recognized authority on insured property losses from catastrophes in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\nCertain factors can impact our estimates of ultimate costs for natural and/or human-made catastrophes, including:\n\u2022Inability to access portions of the affected areas after a catastrophic event;\n\u2022Scarcity of necessary labor and materials that delay repairs and increase our loss costs;\n\u2022Regulatory uncertainties, including new or expanded interpretations of coverage;\n\u2022Residual market assessment-related increases in our catastrophe losses;\n\u2022Potential fraud and inflated repair costs, partly driven by (a) demand surge post-event, and (b) opportunistic service providers;\n\u2022Higher loss adjustment expenses due to shortages of claims adjusters available to appraise damage;\n\u2022Late claims reporting;\n\u2022Escalation of business interruption costs due to infrastructure disruption; and\n\u2022Whether the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury certifies an event as a terrorist act under TRIPRA.\nNatural catastrophes\nThe United Nation\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (\u201cIPCC\u201d) is an international body responsible for assessing climate change science. In 2018, the IPCC estimated in its \"Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0C\" that human activities (i) have caused approximately 1.8\u00b0F of global warming above pre-industrial levels and (ii) could cause an additional 0.9\u00b0F increase above pre-industrial levels between 2030 and 2052. Climate change models project robust differences in global regional climate characteristics between 1.8\u00b0F and 3.6\u00b0F. The IPCC's 2019 \"Special Report on Climate Change and Land\" reinforced these findings, as did the IPCC\u2019s \u201c2021: Summary for Policymakers. In: Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis. Contribution of Working Group I to the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\u201d\nThese global regional differences, whether attributable to nature or human activities, include increases in (i) mean temperature in most land and ocean regions, (ii) hot extremes in most inhabited regions, (iii) heavy precipitation in several regions, and (iv) the probability of drought and precipitation deficits in some regions. These temperature changes can impact weather patterns and the frequency and severity of catastrophes, including hurricanes, severe convective storms, and wildfires - all of which could cause our catastrophe losses to increase.\nHuman-made catastrophes\nThe risk of a wide-scale criminal or terrorist cyber-attack has become more significant and has drawn increased attention from IT and national security experts, U.S. policymakers, the U.S. military, and the insurance industry. There is increased general recognition that a wide-scale cyber-attack that simultaneously impacts multiple victims is more likely and insurance industry systemic risk has increased. We have identified three primary sources of potential insured exposure to cyber losses: (i) cyber specific policies designed to cover both first-party and third-party losses; (ii) affirmative cyber coverage grants included in\nother types of policies, such as commercial property or businessowners policies; and (iii) \u201csilent cyber\u201d exposures that may exist if courts, regardless of intent, interpret policy forms without specific related coverage exclusions to provide coverage for a cyber-related incident.\nWe provide cyber-specific policies to our commercial lines and personal lines customers through 100% reinsured solutions with highly-rated specialty cyber markets. These markets allow us to mitigate our underwriting risk, meet our customers\u2019 needs for cyber insurance, and develop our expertise in the cyber insurance market. Our other insurance policies provide some first- and third-party cyber coverages:\n\u2022We offer limited first-party affirmative cyber coverage in our commercial property and businessowners policy forms. We believe we have limited our \u201csilent cyber\u201d exposure through an affirmative coverage grant subject to a sub-limit.\n\u2022Our base property forms typically include a coverage grant of $2,000 or $10,000 and most of our property policies also contain an affirmative endorsement providing \u201cvirus and harmful code\u201d coverage subject to a sub-limit. Over 90% of our policies with virus/harmful code coverage on commercial property, businessowners, commercial output policy, or inland marine forms have sublimits of $25,000 or lower.\n\u2022Most of our general liability policies and businessowners policies specifically exclude cyber-related liability losses, except for \"bodily injury.\" Our specific cyber-exclusion and our liability forms' lack of affirmative sub-limited cyber coverage, effectively limit most \u201csilent cyber\u201d exposure. Any related potential exposures, however, are subject to our Casualty Reinsurance Program, which has no cyber-related loss exclusion.\n\u2022By statute, workers compensation policies do not have cyber exclusions, and a cyber-attack-related workplace injury could trigger coverage.\nAn increase in natural or man-made catastrophe losses, including a systemic cyber-attack resulting in an aggregation of property and/or casualty cyber losses, will reduce our net income and stockholders\u2019 equity and could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial strength, and debt ratings. In addition, the closer a catastrophe occurs to the end of a reporting period, the more likely we have limited information to estimate loss and loss expense reserves, adding greater uncertainty to our estimates. More detailed claims information available after a reporting period may result in reserve changes in subsequent periods.\nOur loss and loss expense reserves may not be adequate to cover actual losses and expenses.\nWe maintain reserves for our estimated liability for loss and loss expense associated with reported and unreported insurance claims. Estimating loss and loss expense reserves is inherently uncertain, and there is no method for precisely estimating the ultimate liability for the settlement of claims. We base our loss and loss expense reserve estimates on our internal comprehensive reserve review, which utilizes our own loss experience, including claims payment and reporting patterns, as well as our view of underlying trends in claims frequency and severity. The results are supplemented with other subjective considerations, such as projected impacts from various broad economic, political, social, and legal developments or trends, such as inflation, ongoing impacts of the COVID-19-related governmental actions, judicial tort decisions, and various state legislative initiatives. The timing or impact of these developments or trends cannot be predicted with certainty, and we cannot be sure the reserves we establish are adequate or will be so in the future.\nWe review our reserve position quarterly and adjust the reserve position accordingly. An increase in reserves (i) reduces net income and stockholders\u2019 equity, and (ii) could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial strength, and debt ratings. As we underwrite new business and renew existing business, we estimate future loss cost trends in pricing our products to generate an adequate risk-adjusted return. If our estimate of future loss cost trends proves to be understated, our pricing of future new and renewal business may be inadequate to cover actual loss costs, understating our future loss and loss expense reserves.\nThree examples of how loss and loss expense reserves might be affected by economic, political, social, or legal developments or trends are:\n\u2022If inflation, including medical and social inflation, is higher than our assumptions, our loss and loss expense reserves associated with our longer tail lines of business may prove to be insufficient. For example, inflation rates in 2021 increased from 2020, as reflected in the overall consumer price index (\"CPI\"), the Core CPI, and the Producer Price Index. We, however, do not know how long elevated inflation will persist. Our workers compensation line of business is susceptible to inflation because of its extended payment pattern and the medical inflationary environment.\n\u2022Our loss and loss expense reserves may be impacted by the following COVID-19-related items:\n\u25e6All of our commercial property and businessowners' policies require direct physical loss of, or damage to, property by a covered cause of loss in order to trigger a business interruption claim. Whether COVID-19-\nrelated contamination, the existence of a pandemic, and/or the continuing government actions cause physical loss of or damage to property continues to be the subject of much debate and litigation. While the insurance industry has won most of the cases at the trial level, many cases are now on appeal and we cannot predict the outcome of that litigation. Our practice is to include in, or attach to, all standard lines commercial property and businessowners' policies an exclusion that states that all loss or property damage caused by, or resulting from, any virus, bacterium, or other microorganism that induces or is capable of inducing physical distress, illness, or disease is not a covered cause of loss. We offer some limited coverages that could apply in COVID-19-related claims and circumstances, primarily tied to clean-up and food-contamination that are subject to sub-limits. Principally all of our commercial property and businessowners' policies now include the very specific and regulatory-approved virus exclusion.\n\u25e6Limited medical resources availability could result in medical inflation and complicate, delay and/or extend medical treatment that could impact exposure on workers compensation, general liability, and personal and commercial automobile claims.\n\u25e6We may have increased workers compensation loss and loss expenses if policyholders' employees in high-risk roles of essential businesses contracted COVID-19 in the workplace. We may experience higher frequency of workers compensation claims, particularly as state legislative or executive order proposals are enacted that create presumptions that the contraction of COVID-19 by an essential business employee who interacted with the public is work-related. We also may see an extension of workers compensation benefits if employees do not have jobs to which they can return.\n\u25e6We may experience an increase in liability claims against our policyholders related to business practices as remote-office work-from-home employees return to their pre-COVID-19 pandemic office and business locations. This may be exacerbated by an active plaintiffs\u2019 attorney seeking to generate COVID-19-related claim activity.\n\u25e6Loss frequency and severity could increase related to our auto and property coverages due to, among other things, disruptions in supply chains and changes in business practices and individual behaviors resulting from the shelter-in-place and social distancing measures, such as arson and fraud.\n\u25e6We may experience delayed reporting of losses, settlement negotiations, and trial of disputed claims that may disrupt our normal claims resolution processes and trends.\n\u2022Various states have expanded or could expand the statute of limitations for civil actions alleging sexual abuse. By retroactively permitting previously time-barred claims, these \u201creviver\u201d laws may result in insurance claims that could significantly increase loss costs and require re-evaluation of previously-established reserves or the creation of new reserves. Since reviver statutes have been enacted, we have received some notices of claims or potential claims for acts alleged to have occurred, some dating as far back as the 1950s. Without prior experience, we cannot estimate how many \"reviver\" claims notices we may receive. Most notices we have received (i) are blanket notices sent by attorneys representing claimants unsure of the alleged assailant or supervising entity's insurer or policy (if any) and (ii) may not implicate any insurance policies we or a predecessor issued. For those we determine implicate a policy we or a predecessor issued, we (i) have investigated or are investigating facts, (ii) have evaluated policy terms, (iii) believe we have appropriate coverage defenses to most of these claims and/or sufficient reinsurance protections, and (iv) have considered these factors in establishing our reserves, which we believe provide a reasonable estimate of the aggregate ultimate net exposure for these claims. As coverage positions may be challenged through litigation or otherwise, we face litigation risks further discussed below in the Risk Factor entitled, \u201cWe are engaged in ordinary routine legal proceedings incidental to our insurance operations that, because litigation outcomes are inherently unpredictable, could impact our reputation and/or have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.\u201d\nFor further discussion on our loss and loss expense reserves, please see the \u201cCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d section of Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d and Note 2. \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" in Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" of this Form 10-K.\nOur ability to reduce our risk exposure depends on the availability and cost of reinsurance.\nWe transfer a significant portion of our underwriting risk exposure - specifically a portion of our loss and loss expense - to reinsurance companies in exchange for a specified portion of premiums. Typically, our reinsurance coverages align with the coverages offered under our primary insurance policies.\nThe availability, amount, and cost of reinsurance depend on market conditions, including retrocessional reinsurance market capacity. Most of our reinsurance contracts have annual terms, so reinsurance costs may fluctuate significantly and not necessarily correlate to the loss experience of our specific book of business. State insurance regulators generally permit us to consider catastrophe reinsurance expense in our filed rates and rating plans. However, the degree and timing of regulatory\napproval may not align with the actual expense impact from new reinsurance terms. Disproportionate increases in our reinsurance expense that we cannot include in our filed rates and rating plans will reduce our earnings. If we are unable to negotiate desired reinsurance amounts or terms, we may experience (i) increased reinsurance expense, (ii) increased risk assumption on individual or aggregate claim losses, and (iii) limitations on our ability to write future business.\nCommercial property and homeowners coverages have historically accounted for most of our catastrophe-related claims. To limit our exposure to catastrophe losses, we purchase catastrophe reinsurance. Our reinsurance coverage may prove to be inadequate, particularly if:\n\u2022We do not purchase sufficient amounts of reinsurance because of defects or inaccuracies in the various modeling software programs we use to analyze our Insurance Subsidiaries' risk;\n\u2022A major catastrophe loss exceeds (i) the purchased reinsurance limit or (ii) the financial capacity of one or more of our reinsurers even if the loss is within the purchased limit;\n\u2022The frequency of catastrophe losses increases and our Insurance Subsidiaries' insured losses exceed the aggregate limits of the catastrophe reinsurance treaty or our Insurance Subsidiaries experience an aggregation of losses that fall below our per occurrence reinsurance retention; or\n\u2022Our reinsurance counterparties (i) are unable to access their reinsurance markets, or retrocessions, (ii) suffer significant financial losses, (iii) are sold, (iv) cease writing reinsurance business, or (v) are unable or unwilling to satisfy their contractual obligations to us.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic and recent increased catastrophic loss activity, the reinsurance industry has sought to tighten contractual terms and conditions, reduce reinsurance capacity, and increase pricing. Tightened terms and conditions include introducing new coverage exclusions, such as excluding losses related to cyber risk and communicable diseases, particularly for business interruption losses in property treaties and, to a lesser extent, in casualty treaties. To the extent we are exposed to losses on our primary policies from risks, such as cyber and communicable disease, that are now principally excluded from coverage under our reinsurance treaties, we face increased underwriting risk. The increased underwriting risk could increase our net loss and loss expenses and increase the volatility in our underwriting results. Decreased reinsurance capacity also would increase our underwriting risk if we cannot fully place our existing reinsurance treaties upon renewal.\nEven with the benefits of reinsurance, our exposure to catastrophe risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings.\nWe may be subject to potentially significant losses from acts of terrorism.\nWe are required to participate in TRIPRA, now extended to December 31, 2027, for our Standard Commercial Lines and E&S Lines business. TRIPRA rescinded all previously-approved coverage exclusions for terrorism and requires private insurers and the U.S. government to share the risk of loss on future acts of terrorism certified by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury. Under TRIPRA, each participating insurer is responsible for paying a significant deductible of specified losses before federal assistance is available. Our deductible of $419 million is based on a percentage of our prior year\u2019s applicable Standard Commercial Lines and E&S Lines premiums. In 2022, the federal government will pay 80% of losses above the deductible, with the insurer retaining 20%. Although TRIPRA will mitigate some of our loss exposure to a large-scale terrorist attack, our deductible could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings. If the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury does not certify specific terrorist events (as occurred with the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing and the 2015 San Bernardino shootings), we could be required to pay terrorism-related covered losses without TRIPRA's risk-sharing benefits. We also could be required to pay terrorism-related losses for customers who declined terrorism coverage.\nOur primary workers compensation policies are required to cover terrorism risk, so TRIPRA applies to those policies. Insureds with non-workers compensation commercial policies have the option to accept or decline our terrorism coverage or negotiate with us for other terms. In 2021, 85% of our Standard Commercial Lines non-workers compensation policyholders purchased terrorism coverage that included nuclear, biological, chemical, and radioactive (\"NBCR\") events. TRIPRA also applies to cyber liability insurance policies reported under a Terrorism Risk Insurance Program-eligible line of insurance.\nMany states mandate that commercial property policies cover fire following an act of terrorism - regardless of whether the insured purchased terrorism coverage. We also sometimes elect to provide terrorism coverage for lines of business not included in TRIPRA, such as Commercial Automobile. TRIPRA has never covered personal lines of business. Our Standard Personal Lines homeowner policies exclude nuclear losses but not biological or chemical losses. Our current reinsurance programs generally cover losses from conventional foreign and domestic terrorism acts, but not NBCR events.\nWe are exposed to credit risk.\nWe face credit risk in several areas of our insurance operations, including from:\n\u2022Our reinsurers, which are obligated to make payments to us under our reinsurance agreements. Reinsurance credit risk can fluctuate over time, increasing during periods of high industry catastrophe and liability losses. Reinsurers generally manage their large loss exposure through their own reinsurance programs, or retrocessions, about which we do not always have the full details. If our reinsurers have difficulty collecting on their retrocession programs or reinstating retrocession coverage after a large loss, we may not receive timely or full payment of our reinsurance claims. This means that we have direct and indirect counterparty credit risk to our reinsurers and the reinsurance industry, which is a global but concentrated market.\n\u2022Certain life insurance companies, if they fail to fulfill their annuity contract obligations to our policyholders or claimants under annuities we purchased as part of structured claims settlements.\n\u2022Some of our independent distribution partners, who collect premiums from our policyholders for us.\n\u2022Some policyholders, who are directly obligated to us for premium and/or deductible payments, the timing of which may be impacted by mandated payment moratoriums.\nOur exposure to credit risk could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings.\nWe depend on distribution partners.\nWe market and sell our insurance products through independent, non-employee distribution partners. Insurance law and regulation makes us responsible for the business practices and customer interactions of our distribution partners. Independent distribution partners have - and we expect will continue to have - a significant role in overall insurance industry premium production. While our customers find advantages in using independent distribution partners, our reliance on independent distribution partners presents risks and challenges, including:\n\u2022Competition in our distribution channel, as we must market our products and services to our independent distribution partners who have access to products from multiple carriers and markets.\n\u2022Challenges in developing brand recognition because we closely coordinate with our distribution partners and some customers cannot differentiate their insurance agent from their insurance carrier.\n\u2022Our market share growth is tied to our distribution partners' market share. Independent retail insurance agencies control 85% of standard commercial lines business and 36% of standard personal lines business in the U.S. Consequently, growth in our Standard Personal Lines could be more limited than in our Standard Commercial Lines. Competitors have focused on lower-cost \"direct-to-customer\" distribution models that emphasize digital ease and efficiencies to address the discrepancy in agency control of standard personal lines business. Continued advancements in \"direct-to-customer\" distribution models may impact the overall market share our independent distribution partners control, make it more difficult for us to grow, or require us to establish relationships with more distribution partners.\n\u2022Aggregation and consolidation of our independent distribution partners and their market share, as some publicly-traded and private equity-backed independent distribution partners have deployed consolidation strategies to acquire other independent distribution partners and increase their market share (\"Aggregators\") over the last decade. If more of our independent distribution partners become Aggregators or are acquired by Aggregators, Aggregator demands and influence on our business could increase. For example, Aggregators could develop and implement strategies to consolidate their business with fewer insurers and demand higher base and supplemental commissions. Aggregators accounted for approximately 36% of our DPW at December 31, 2021, up from 28% three years ago. Currently, no one distribution partner is responsible for 10% or more of our combined insurance operations' premium.\nOur financial condition and results of operations are impacted by our independent distribution partners' success in marketing and selling our products and services.\nNational and global economic conditions could adversely and materially affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and growth.\nUnfavorable economic developments, such as increased inflation levels and the effect, lifting, or lapsing of COVID-19-related governmental directives experienced in 2021, could adversely affect our earnings if our policyholders need less insurance coverage, cancel existing insurance policies, modify coverage, or choose not to renew with us. Inflation and unemployment increases could significantly impact our claims severity across multiple lines of business and could result in adverse reserve development. Heightened levels of economic inflation also could cause higher interest rates, which would likely result in unrealized losses within our portfolio of fixed income securities and lower total returns from our other invested assets. The effect, lifting, or lapsing of COVID-19-related governmental directives in 2021 disrupted supply chains and caused shortages of products, services, and labor. These economic condition-induced shortages may impact our ability to attract and retain labor, including increasing attrition rates, wages, and the cost and difficulty of obtaining third-party resources. An economic downturn also could lead to increased credit and premium receivable risk, failure of reinsurance counterparties and other financial institutions, limitations on our ability to issue new debt, reduced liquidity, and declines in our investments' fair value and financial strength ratings. These potential events and other economic factors could adversely and materially affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and growth. During 2021, 28% of DPW in our Standard Commercial Lines business was based on payroll or sales of our underlying policyholders. An economic downturn in which our policyholders experience declines in revenue or employee count could adversely affect our total written premium, including audit and endorsement premium.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to have widespread, rapidly evolving, and unpredictable impacts on ordinary business commerce and financial markets. Federal and state governments have acted to contain the virus, including establishing social distancing requirements, travel restrictions, and vaccination initiatives. While pandemic containment efforts have resulted in the relaxation of some restrictions, new virus variants are leading to new outbreaks and restrictions. The COVID-19 pandemic has and will likely continue to impact our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. There is substantial uncertainty about the nature and degree of its continued effects over time. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business going forward will depend on numerous evolving factors we cannot reliably predict, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, its impact on economic activity, including the possibility of financial market instability or recession, and the response of government, businesses, and individuals.\nA downgrade or a potential downgrade in our financial strength or credit ratings could result in a loss of business and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant financial strength rating downgrade, particularly from AM Best, would affect our ability to write new or renewal business. Most policyholders are required by various third-party agreements, primarily with lenders, to maintain insurance policies from a carrier with a minimum AM Best or S&P rating. Credit rating downgrades could also make it more expensive for us to access capital markets. We cannot predict the possible rating actions NRSROs might take that could adversely affect our business or our potential actions in response. Any significant downgrade in our financial strength and credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings. For additional information on our current financial strength and credit ratings, refer to \"Overview\" in Item 1. \"Business.\" of this Form 10-K.\nMarkets for insurance products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and we may be unable to compete effectively.\nWe offer our insurance products and services in a highly competitive market characterized by aggressive price competition and downward pressure on underwriting margins, introduction of new products and services, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product pricing based on performance characteristics and larger data sets, rapid competitor adoption of technological advancements, and consumer and business price sensitivity. Our ability to compete successfully depends heavily on our timely and consistent introduction of innovative new products and services through digital platforms.\nWe face substantial competition from a wide range of property and casualty insurance companies for customers, distribution partners, and employees. Competitors include public, private, and mutual insurance companies. Many competitors are larger and may have lower relative operating costs, lower cost of capital, or greater ability to absorb or diversify more risk while maintaining their financial strength ratings. Other competitors, such as mutual or reciprocal companies, are owned by or operated cooperatively for insureds and, unlike us, do not have shareholders who evaluate ROE performance. Consequently, some competitors may be able to price their products more competitively.\nThe Internet has emerged as a significant competitive digital marketplace for existing and new competitors. Established insurance competitors, such as The Progressive Corporation, are beginning to explore broader digital Internet offerings, while new competitors with variations on traditional business models have emerged, such as Lemonade, Root, and Next. Because the Internet makes it easier and less expensive to bundle products and services, it also is possible that non-insurance companies\nconducting business on the Internet could enter the insurance business or form strategic alliances with insurers in the future. Changes in competitors and competition, particularly on the Internet, could cause changes in the supply or demand for insurance and adversely affect our business.\nThe increasing importance of the Internet, technology, and digital strategy in our industry also highlights our need to attract and retain employees in difficult-to-fill data science, advanced analytics, and IT roles - and the potential negative impact if we fail in so doing.\nWe have less loss experience data than our larger competitors.\nInsurers depend on access to reliable data about their policyholders and loss experience to build complex analytics and predictive models that assess risk profitability, reserve adequacy, adverse claim development potential, recovery opportunities, fraudulent activities, and customer buying habits. Because we use and depend on the aggregated industry loss data assembled by rating bureaus under the antitrust exemptions of the McCarran-Ferguson Act, we likely would be at a competitive disadvantage to larger insurers if Congress repealed the McCarran-Ferguson Act.\nWe expect the use of data science and analytics to increase and become more complex and accurate, particularly with larger sets of relevant data. Some larger competitors have significantly more data about the performance of their underwritten risks. In comparison, we may not have sufficient volumes of loss experience data to analyze and project our future costs as accurately or granularly. We use industry loss experience from ISO, AAIS, NCCI, and other publicly available sources to supplement our data. While relevant, industry data may not correlate specifically to the performance of our underwritten risks and be as predictive as data on a larger book of our own business.\nWe are subject to various modeling risks that could have a material adverse impact on our business results.\nWe rely on complex financial and other statistical models, developed internally and by third parties, to predict (i) underwriting results on individual risks and our overall portfolio, (ii) claims fraud and other claims impacts, such as escalation, (iii) impacts from catastrophes, (iv) enterprise risk management capital scenarios, and (v) investment portfolio changes. We rely on these financial and other statistical models to analyze historical loss costs and pricing, claims severity and frequency trends, catastrophe losses, reinsurance attachment and exhaustion points, investment performance, portfolio risk, and our economic capital position. Flaws in these financial and other statistical models, or in their embedded assumptions, could lead to increased losses. Our statistical models are extremely useful in monitoring and controlling risk, but they are not a substitute for senior management's experience or judgment.\nRisks Related to Our Investments Segment\nOur investments are exposed to credit risk, interest rate fluctuation, and changes in value.\nWe depend on income from our investment portfolio for a significant portion of our revenue and earnings. Our investments can be negatively affected by (i) liquidity, (ii) credit deterioration, (iii) financial results, (iv) public equity and/or debt market changes, (v) economic conditions, including heightened levels of economic inflation and any ongoing COVID-19-related governmental orders, (vi) political risk, (vii) sovereign risk, (viii) interest rate fluctuations, or (ix) other factors, including climate change risk and civil unrest. Our investment portfolio's value is subject to credit risk from the issuers, and/or guarantors and insurers, of the securities we hold and other counterparties in certain transactions. Defaults on any of our investments by any issuer, guarantor, insurer, or other counterparty could reduce our net investment income and net realized investment gains - or result in investment losses. We are subject to the risk that the issuers or guarantors of fixed income securities we own may default on principal and interest payment obligations.\nAdditionally, we are exposed to interest rate risk, primarily related to the market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in interest rates. Consequently, the value and liquidity of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Future fluctuations in the value of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable and non-marketable securities could result in significant losses and have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results.\nOur investment portfolio also has climate change-related transition risks. Transition risks arise from society\u2019s transition towards a low-carbon economy, driven by policy and regulations, low-carbon technology advancement, and shifting sentiment and societal preferences. This transition can lead to stranded assets in areas such as the fossil-fuel and automotive industries. It can also result in increased costs to reinvest in and replace infrastructure and litigation against fossil-fuel companies. Transition risks can lead to corporate asset devaluation, lower corporate profitability, lower property values, and lower household wealth. Transition risks may reduce the market value of some energy, transportation, and other investments with high carbon footprints\nor those closely tied to carbon-based economic activity. As of December 31, 2021, sectors identified as carbon intensive within our fixed income securities portfolio represented less than 5% of our total invested assets.\nSignificant future investment value declines could require further losses recorded on securities we intend to sell and credit losses. For more information regarding market interest rate, credit, and equity price risk, see Item 7A. \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nWe have securities tied to LIBOR, which will be eliminated on June 30, 2023.\nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately 15% of our fixed income securities portfolio had floating rate securities primarily tied to the 1- and 3-month U.S. dollar-denominated London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\"). The global banking industry has used LIBOR as a primary metric to calculate interest rates for numerous types of debt obligations, including personal and commercial loans, interest rate swaps, and other derivative products. In anticipation of LIBOR's elimination, the U.S. Federal Reserve established the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\"ARRC\") to select a replacement index for U.S. Dollar LIBOR. The ARRC, comprised of a broad group of private-market participants, including banks, asset managers, insurers, and industry regulators, identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") as the recommended benchmark rate to replace LIBOR. SOFR is based on overnight repurchase agreement transactions backed by U.S. Treasury securities. The ARRC announced a paced transition plan for this new rate, including specific steps and timelines designed to encourage the adoption of SOFR. Effective December 31, 2021, LIBOR can no longer be used as a benchmark reference rate in new issue loans, securitized products, and other floating rate instruments. Effective June 30, 2023, LIBOR will cease to exist and require remaining floating rate securities to transition to SOFR. Consequently, our fixed income securities portfolio may be subject to (i) interest rate and prepayment risk associated with the resetting of our floating rate coupons from LIBOR to SOFR, (ii) potential rating agency downgrades, (iii) reduced trading liquidity on securities with insufficient fallback transition language, and (iv) lower returns associated with basis risk from a reference rate mismatch between liabilities and assets in certain securitized assets. We continue to monitor the potential impact, if any, the elimination of LIBOR and the transition to SOFR will have on our floating rate investments' performance. We have and continue to evaluate and monitor other LIBOR risks across the organization.\nWe are subject to the risks inherent in investing in private limited partnerships.\nOur other investments include investments in private limited partnerships that invest in various strategies, such as private equity, private credit, and real assets. The primary assets and liabilities underlying the investments in these limited partnerships generally do not have quoted prices in active markets for the same or similar assets, so their valuation is subject to a higher level of subjectivity and unobservable inputs than substantially all of our other investments. Because these limited partnership investments are recorded under the equity method of accounting, any valuation decreases could negatively impact our results of operations. Because of their return relative to risk, we currently expect to slightly increase our allocation to these investments, which may produce additional variability in our net investment income.\nThe determination of the amount of credit losses taken on our investments is highly subjective and could materially impact our results of operations or our financial position.\nThe determination of the amount of credit losses taken on our investments is based on our quarterly evaluation and assessment of our investments and known and inherent risks associated with the various asset classes. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. Management updates its evaluations regularly and reflects changes in credit losses at the time of evaluation. There can be no assurance that management has accurately assessed the level of credit losses recorded in our Financial Statements. For further information about our evaluation and considerations for determining whether a security has a credit loss, please refer to \u201cCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d in Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Evolving Laws, Regulations, and Public Policy Debates\nWe are subject to complex and changing laws, regulations, and public policy debates that expose us to regulatory scrutiny, potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on our business.\nOur operations are subject to complex and changing state and federal laws, regulations, and public policy debates on subjects, including, without limitation, the following:\n\u2022Pricing and underwriting practices;\n\u2022Claims practices;\n\u2022Loss and loss adjustment expense reserves;\n\u2022Exiting geographic markets and/or canceling or non-renewing policies;\n\u2022Environmental, social, and governance (\"ESG\") related issues, including ESG investment mandates;\n\u2022Assessments for guaranty funds and second-injury funds, and other mandatory assigned risks and reinsurance;\n\u2022The types, quality, and concentration of investments we make;\n\u2022Minimum capital requirements for the Insurance Subsidiaries;\n\u2022Dividends from our Insurance Subsidiaries to the Parent;\n\u2022Privacy and data security;\n\u2022Tax;\n\u2022Antitrust;\n\u2022Consumer protection;\n\u2022Advertising;\n\u2022Sales;\n\u2022Billing and e-commerce;\n\u2022Intellectual property ownership and infringement;\n\u2022Digital platforms;\n\u2022Internet, telecommunications, and mobile communications;\n\u2022Media and digital content;\n\u2022Availability of third-party software applications and services;\n\u2022Labor and employment;\n\u2022Anti-money laundering; and\n\u2022Workplace environmental, health, and safety issues.\nChanges to laws and regulations can adversely affect our business by increasing our costs, limiting our ability to offer a product or service to customers, requiring changes to our business practices, or otherwise making our products and services less attractive to customers.\nIf Congress enacted a law directly regulating insurance, particularly insurer solvency oversight, and state regulators remained responsible for rate approval, we could be subject to a conflicting and inconsistent regulatory framework that could impact our profitability and capital adequacy.\nWhile we underwrite risks only in the U.S., international regulatory developments, particularly related to capital adequacy and risk management requirements in the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d), may influence U.S. regulators as they develop or revise domestic regulatory standards. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the NAIC's Group Capital Calculation Working Group adopted the basic structure of its new Group Capital Calculation and drafted model law changes that provide for its adoption as a state law requirement for U.S. insurance groups. It is expected that state legislatures will begin to adopt the group capital calculation model law by year-end 2022. The changes could increase the amount of capital our insurance subsidiaries are required to hold.\nWe have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. However, we can provide no assurance that our employees, contractors, or independent distribution partners will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies and procedures. To some degree, we have multiple regulators whose authority may overlap and may have different interpretations and/or regulations related to the same legal issues. This creates the risk that one regulator's position or interpretation may conflict with another regulator on the same issue. The cost of complying with various, potentially conflicting laws and regulations, and changes in those laws and regulations, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings.\nInsurers are subject to intense regulatory, political, and media scrutiny. We are subject to government market conduct review and investigations, legal actions, and penalties. There can be no assurance that our business will not be materially adversely affected by the outcomes of such examinations, investigations, or media scrutiny in the future. If we are found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur business is subject to a variety of state, federal, and other laws, rules, policies, and other obligations regarding data protection.\nWe are subject to federal and state laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security, and transfer of personally identifiable information (\u201cPII\u201d). Federal laws include the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Drivers Privacy Protection Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and Unfair and Deceptive Acts and Practices laws. Several states, like New York, Nevada, Colorado, Virginia, and California, have passed laws in this area, and other jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or creating new rights concerning PII. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements may cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant reputational harm, penalties, and legal liability.\nThe EU adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\") in 2016. Effective since 2018 after a two-year implementation period, GDPR regulates data protection and privacy in the EU and transfers of personal data outside the EU.\nGDPR\u2019s main tenet is to give individuals primary control over their personal data. Because we do not write coverages in the EU, GDPR has no direct impact on us. Some U.S. states have subsequently incorporated individual-control mechanisms into state privacy laws. Future EU data privacy actions likely will influence U.S. regulators over time.\nWe make statements about our use and disclosure of PII through our privacy policy, information provided on our website, and other public statements. If we fail to comply with these public statements or federal and state privacy-related and data protection laws and regulations, we could be subject to litigation or governmental actions. Such proceedings could impact our reputation and result in penalties, including ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability.\nWe are engaged in ordinary routine legal proceedings incidental to our insurance operations that, because litigation outcomes are inherently unpredictable, could impact our reputation and/or have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.\nWe are engaged in ordinary routine legal proceedings incidental to our insurance operations that include:\n\u2022Defense of or indemnity for third-party suits brought against our insureds;\n\u2022Defense of actions brought against us by our insureds who disagree with our coverage decisions, some of which allege bad faith claims handling and seek extra-contractual damages, punitive damages, or other penalties;\n\u2022Actions we file, primarily for declaratory judgment, seeking confirmation that we have made appropriate coverage decisions under our insurance contracts;\n\u2022Actions brought against us or competitors alleging improper business practices and sometimes seeking class status. Such actions historically have included issues and allegations, without limitation, related to (i) unfairly discriminatory underwriting practices, including the impact of credit score usage, (ii) managed care practices, such as provider reimbursement, and (iii) automobile claims practices; and\n\u2022Actions we file against third parties and other insurers for subrogation and recovery of other amounts we paid on behalf of our insureds.\nFrom time-to-time, legal proceedings in which we are involved may receive media attention based on their perceived newsworthiness and/or relationship to a variety of broad economic, political, social, and legal developments or trends. Such media stories could negatively impact our reputation.\nWe expect any potential ultimate liability for ordinary routine legal proceedings incidental to our insurance business will not be material to our consolidated financial condition after considering estimated loss provisions. Litigation outcomes, however, are inherently unpredictable even with meritorious defenses. The time a case is in litigation also is unpredictable, as state court dockets are increasingly overcrowded. Generally, the longer a case is in litigation, the more expensive it can become. Because the amounts sought in certain of these actions are large or indeterminate, any adverse outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.\nAdditionally, we do not have any material litigation risks related to climate change.\nRisks Related to Our Corporate Structure and Governance\nWe are a holding company, and our ability to declare dividends to our shareholders, pay indebtedness, and enter into affiliate transactions may be limited because our Insurance Subsidiaries are regulated.\nRestrictions on our Insurance Subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends, make loans or advances to the Parent, or enter into transactions with affiliates may materially affect our ability to pay dividends on our preferred stock and common stock, or repay our indebtedness.\nBased on these restrictions, the maximum in ordinary annual dividends the Insurance Subsidiaries can provide the Parent in 2022 is $322 million. Their ability to pay dividends or make loans or advances, however, is subject to domiciliary state insurance regulators' approval or review. For additional details regarding dividend restrictions, see Note 22. \u201cStatutory Financial Information, Capital Requirements, and Restrictions on Dividends and Transfers of Funds\u201d in Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" of this Form 10-K.\nThe Parent\u2019s ability to pay dividends to its stockholders is also impacted by covenants in its credit agreement (the \u201cLine of Credit\u201d) among the Parent, the lenders named therein (the \u201cLenders\u201d), and the Bank of Montreal, Chicago Branch, as Administrative Agent. These covenants obligate the Parent to, among other things, maintain a minimum consolidated net worth and a maximum ratio of debt to capitalization. Under the terms of our Preferred Stock, the Parent's ability to declare or pay dividends on, or purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, shares of its common stock or any shares of the Parent that rank junior to, or on parity with, the Preferred Stock will be subject to certain restrictions if the Parent does not declare and pay (or set aside) dividends on the Preferred Stock for the last preceding dividend period. For additional details about the Line of Credit\u2019s\nfinancial covenants, see Note 11. \u201cIndebtedness\u201d in Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Form 10-K. For additional details about conditions related to our Preferred Stock, see Note 17. \"Preferred Stock\" in Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Form 10-K.\nBecause we are a New Jersey corporation and an insurance holding company, we may be less attractive to potential acquirers and the value of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nWe are a New Jersey company, and provisions of the New Jersey Shareholders\u2019 Protection Act and our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation may discourage, delay, or prevent us from being acquired. A supermajority of our shareholders must approve (i) certain business combinations with interested shareholders, or (ii) any amendment to the related provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation unless certain conditions are met. These conditions may relate to, among other things, the interested stockholder\u2019s acquisition of stock, the approval of the business combination by disinterested members of our Board and disinterested stockholders, and the price and payment of the consideration proposed in the business combination. In addition to considering the effects of any action on our shareholders (including any offer or proposal to acquire the Parent), our Board may consider: (i) the long-term, as well as the short-term, interests of the Parent and our shareholders, including the possibility that these interests may best be served by the continued independence of the Parent; (ii) the effects of the action on the Parent's employees, suppliers, creditors, and customers; and (iii) the effects of the action on the community in which the Parent operates.\nThese provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and New Jersey law could deprive our common shareholders of an opportunity to receive a premium over the prevailing market price in the event of a hostile takeover and may adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nBecause we own insurance subsidiaries, any party seeking to acquire 10% or more of our common stock must seek prior approval from the subsidiaries' domiciliary insurance regulators and file extensive information about their business operations and finances. The New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance Commissioner, who regulates seven of our Insurance Subsidiaries, also considers whether (i) the acquisition of control of an insurer would be adverse to the public interest or the protection of existing and future policyholders or (ii) persons seeking control would use control adversely to the public interest or the protection of policyholders.\nRisks Related to Our General Operations\nWe, our distribution partners, and our vendors are subject to attempted cyber-attacks, other cybersecurity risks, and system availability risk.\nOur business heavily relies on IT and application systems that may be accessed from, or are connected to, the Internet. Consequently, a malicious cyber-attack could affect us. Our systems also contain proprietary and confidential information, including PII, about our operations, employees, agents, and customers and their employees and property. A malicious cyber-attack on (i) our systems, (ii) our distribution partners or their key operating systems, and (iii) any other of our third-party partners or vendors and their key operating systems may interrupt our ability to operate, damage our reputation and result in monetary damages that are difficult to quantify, and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings.\nWe have implemented systems and processes, through encryption and authentication technologies, intended to mitigate or secure our IT systems and prevent unauthorized access to, or loss of, sensitive data. As cyber-attacks continue to evolve daily, our security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities. We may be vulnerable to hacking, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management, or other irregularities. Any disruption or breach of our systems or data security could damage our reputation, result in monetary damages that are difficult to quantify, and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings. To mitigate this risk, we have and expect to continue to (i) conduct employee education programs and tabletop exercises and (ii) develop and invest in a variety of controls to prevent, detect, and appropriately react to cyber-attacks, including frequently testing our systems' security and access controls. We have insurance coverage for certain cybersecurity risks, including privacy breach incidents, which coverage may be insufficient to indemnify all losses or types of claims that may arise.\nIn addition to cyber-attack risk, we face system availability risk. Our business relies heavily on various IT and application systems. We have robust business continuity plans, which are designed to minimize the duration and impact of an unexpected loss of availability of any of these systems. Nevertheless, we could experience an event that impacts one or more of these systems, including those based in facilities where we or our vendors operate, which may interrupt our ability to operate and negatively impact our results of operations, despite our business continuity plans.\nOur long-term strategy to deploy operational leverage is dependent on the success of our risk management strategies, and their failure could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nAs an insurer, we assume risk from our policyholders. Our long-term strategy includes the use of above-average operational leverage, which can be measured as the ratio of NPW to our equity or statutory surplus. We balance and mitigate our operational leverage risk with several risk management strategies within our insurance operations to achieve a balance of growth and profit, including using significant amounts of reinsurance, a disciplined approach to reserving, and a conservative investment philosophy. These strategies have inherent limitations. We cannot be certain that an event or series of unanticipated events will not occur and result in losses greater than we expect. Given our higher operating leverage than that of our industry, an event or series of unanticipated events could have a more material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, financial condition, financial strength, and debt ratings compared to our industry.", "PERMNO": 68292, "SIC": 6331, "TIC": "SIGI"}
