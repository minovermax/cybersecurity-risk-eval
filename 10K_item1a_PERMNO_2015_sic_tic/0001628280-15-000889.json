{"cik": "816284", "company": "CELGENE CORP /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-20", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following describes the major risks to our business and should be considered carefully. Any of these factors could significantly and negatively affect our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results or credit ratings, which could cause the trading prices of our equity securities to decline. The risks described below are not the only risks we may face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or risks that we currently consider immaterial, could also negatively affect us.\nOur operating results are subject to significant fluctuations.\nOur operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year for a number of reasons, including the risks discussed elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. Events such as a delay in product development or a revenue shortfall may cause financial results for a particular period to be below our expectations. In addition, we have experienced and may continue to experience fluctuations in our quarterly operating results due to the timing of charges that we may take. We have recorded, or may be required to record, charges that include development milestone and license payments under collaboration and license agreements, amortization of acquired intangibles and other acquisition related charges, and impairment charges.\nOur revenues are also subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations due to the global nature of our operations. We recognize foreign currency gains or losses arising from our operation in the period in which we incur those gains or losses. Although we utilize foreign currency forward contracts and occasionally foreign currency put and call options to manage foreign currency risk, our efforts to reduce currency exchange losses may not be successful. As a result, currency fluctuation among our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar, and the currencies in which we do business will affect our operating results. Our net income may also fluctuate due to the impact of charges we may be required to take with respect to foreign currency and other hedge transactions. In particular, we may incur higher than expected charges from hedge ineffectiveness or from the termination of a hedge arrangement. For more information, see Item 7A. \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Market Risk Management - Foreign Currency Risk Management.\u201d\nWe are dependent on the continued commercial success of our primary products, REVLIMID\u00ae, VIDAZA\u00ae, THALOMID\u00ae, ABRAXANE\u00ae, POMALYST\u00ae/IMNOVID\u00ae and OTEZLA\u00ae.\nCurrently, our business is largely dependent on the commercial success of REVLIMID\u00ae, VIDAZA\u00ae, THALOMID\u00ae, ABRAXANE\u00ae, POMALYST\u00ae/IMNOVID\u00ae and OTEZLA\u00ae. The success of these products depends on acceptance by regulators, key opinion leaders, physicians, and patients as effective drugs with certain advantages over other therapies. A number of factors, as discussed in greater detail below, may adversely impact the degree of acceptance of these products, including their efficacy, safety, price and benefits over competing products, as well as the reimbursement policies of third-party payers, such as government and private insurance plans.\nIf unexpected adverse events are reported in connection with the use of any of these products, physician and patient acceptance of the product could deteriorate and the commercial success of such product could be adversely affected. We are required to report to the FDA or similar bodies in other countries events associated with our products relating to death or serious injury. Adverse events could result in additional regulatory controls, such as for the imposition of costly post-approval clinical studies or revisions to our approved labeling which could limit the indications or patient population for a product or could even lead to the withdrawal of a product from the market. THALOMID\u00ae is known to be toxic to the human fetus and exposure to the drug during pregnancy could result in significant deformities. REVLIMID\u00ae and POMALYST\u00ae/IMNOVID\u00ae are also considered toxic to the human fetus and their respective labels contain warnings against use which could result in embryo-fetal exposure. While we have restricted distribution systems for THALOMID\u00ae, REVLIMID\u00ae, and POMALYST\u00ae/IMNOVID\u00ae, and endeavor to educate patients regarding the potential known adverse events, including pregnancy risks, we cannot ensure that all such warnings and recommendations will be complied with or that adverse events resulting from non-compliance will not occur.\nOur future commercial success depends on gaining regulatory approval for products in development, and obtaining approvals for our current products for additional indications.\nThe testing, manufacturing and marketing of our products require regulatory approvals, including approval from the FDA and similar bodies in other countries. Certain of our pharmaceutical products, such as FOCALIN\u00ae, also require authorization by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) of the U.S. Department of Justice. Our future growth would be negatively impacted if we fail to obtain timely, or at all, requisite regulatory approvals in the United States and internationally for products in development and approvals for our existing products for additional indications.\nThe principal risks to obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals are as follows:\n\u2022\nIn general, preclinical tests and clinical trials can take many years and require the expenditure of substantial resources, and the data obtained from these tests and trials may not lead to regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nDelays or rejections may be encountered during any stage of the regulatory process if the clinical or other data fails to demonstrate compliance with a regulatory agency\u2019s requirements for safety, efficacy and quality;\n\u2022\nRequirements for approval may become more stringent due to changes in regulatory agency policy or the adoption of new regulations or legislation;\n\u2022\nEven if a product is approved, the scope of the approval may significantly limit the indicated uses or the patient population for which the product may be marketed and may impose significant limitations in the nature of warnings, precautions and contra-indications that could materially affect the sales and profitability of the product;\n\u2022\nAfter a product is approved, the FDA or similar bodies in other countries may withdraw or modify an approval in a significant manner or request that we perform additional clinical trials or change the labeling of the product due to a number of reasons, including safety concerns, adverse events and side effects;\n\u2022\nProducts, such as REVLIMID\u00ae and POMALYST\u00ae/IMNOVID\u00ae, that receive accelerated approval can be subject to an expedited withdrawal if post-marketing restrictions are not adhered to or are shown to be inadequate to assure safe use, or if the drug is shown to be unsafe or ineffective under its conditions of use;\n\u2022\nGuidelines and recommendations published by various governmental and non-governmental organizations can reduce the use of our approved products;\n\u2022\nApproved products, as well as their manufacturers, are subject to continuing and ongoing review by regulatory agencies, and the discovery of previously unknown problems with these products or the failure to comply with manufacturing or quality control requirements may result in restrictions on the manufacture, sale or use of a product or its withdrawal from the market; and\n\u2022\nChanges in regulatory agency policy or the adoption of new regulations or legislation could impose restrictions on the sale of our approved products.\nIf we fail to comply with laws or government regulations or policies our business could be adversely affected.\nThe discovery, preclinical development, clinical trials, manufacturing, risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (such as our REMSTM program), marketing and labeling of pharmaceuticals and biologics are all subject to extensive laws and government regulations and policies. In addition, individual states, acting through their attorneys general, are increasingly seeking to regulate the marketing of prescription drugs under state consumer protection and false advertising laws. If we fail to comply with the laws and regulations regarding the promotion and sale of our products, appropriate distribution of our products under our restricted distribution systems, off-label promotion and the promotion of unapproved products, government agencies may bring enforcement actions against us or private litigants may assert claims on behalf of the government against us that could inhibit our commercial capabilities and/or result in significant damage awards and penalties.\nOther matters that may be the subject of governmental or regulatory action which could adversely affect our business include laws, regulations and policies governing:\n\u2022\nprotection of the environment, privacy, healthcare reimbursement programs, and competition;\n\u2022\nparallel importation of prescription drugs from outside the United States at prices that are regulated by the governments of various foreign countries; and\n\u2022\nmandated disclosures of clinical trial or other data, such as the EMA\u2019s policy on publication of clinical data.\nThe FDA\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research currently regulates human tissue or cells intended for transplantation, implantation, infusion or transfer to a human, requiring, among other things, cell and tissue establishments to screen and test donors, prepare and follow written procedures for the prevention of the spread of communicable disease and register with FDA. Through our Celgene Cellular Therapeutics (CCT) subsidiary, we are licensed in certain states to operate our allogeneic and private stem cell banking businesses. If we are unable to maintain those licenses or are unable to obtain licenses in other states that may adopt similar licensing requirements, those businesses could be adversely affected.\nSales of our products will be significantly reduced if access to and reimbursement for our products by governmental and other third-party payers are reduced or terminated.\nSales of our current and future products depend, in large part, on the conditions under which our products are paid for by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar health care management organizations (HCMOs), or reimbursed by government health administration authorities, private health coverage insurers and other third-party payers.\nThe influence of HCMOs has increased in recent years due to the growing number of patients receiving coverage through a few large HCMOs as a result of industry consolidation. One objective of HCMOs is to contain and, where possible, reduce healthcare expenditures. HCMOs typically use formularies (lists of approved medicines available to members of a particular HCMO), clinical protocols, volume purchasing, long-term contracts and other methods to negotiate prices with pharmaceutical providers. Due to their lower cost generally, generic medicines are typically placed in preferred tiers of HCMO formularies. Additionally, many formularies include alternative and competitive products for treatment of particular medical problems. Exclusion of our products from a formulary or HCMO-implemented restrictions imposed upon our products can significantly impact drug usage in the HCMO patient population, and consequently our revenues.\nGenerally, in Europe and other countries outside the United States, the government-sponsored healthcare system is the primary payer of patients\u2019 healthcare costs. These health care management organizations and third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, seeking to implement cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Our products continue to be subject to increasing price and reimbursement pressure due to price controls imposed by governments in many countries; increased difficulty in obtaining and maintaining satisfactory drug reimbursement rates; and the tendency of governments and private health care providers to favor generic pharmaceuticals. In addition, governmental and private third-party payers and purchasers of our products may restrict access to formularies or otherwise discourage use of our products. Limitations on patient access to our drugs, adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures could adversely affect our business. In addition, our operating results may also be affected by distributors seeking to take advantage of price differences among various markets by buying our products in low cost markets for resale in higher cost markets.\nThe Affordable Care Act and other legislation may affect our pricing policies and government reimbursement of our products that may adversely impact our revenues and profitability.\nIn the U.S. there have been and may continue to be a number of legislative and regulatory proposals and enactments related to drug pricing and reimbursement that could impact our profitability. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 were signed into law on March 23, 2010 and March 30, 2010, respectively, and are referred to collectively as the Healthcare Reform Acts. Although these reforms have significantly impacted the pharmaceutical industry, the full effects of these provisions will become apparent over time as these laws are implemented and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and other agencies issue applicable regulations or guidance as required by the Healthcare Reform Acts. Moreover, in the coming years, additional changes could be made to governmental healthcare programs that could significantly impact the profitability of our products.\nThe Healthcare Reform Acts, among other things, made significant changes to the Medicaid rebate program by increasing the minimum rebates that manufacturers like us are required to pay. These changes also expanded the government\u2019s 340B drug discount program by increasing the category of entities qualified to participate in the program and benefit from its deeply discounted drug pricing. We have received inquiries from the Health Resources and Services Administration of the Department of Health & Human Services (\u201cHRSA\u201d) regarding our compliance with the 340B program. We have responded to these inquiries and believe that we have complied with applicable legal requirements. If, however, we are ultimately required to change our sales or pricing practices, there would be an adverse effect on our revenues and profitability.\nOur ability to sell our products to hospitals in the United States depends in part on our relationships with group purchasing organizations.\nMany existing and potential customers for our products become members of group purchasing organizations (GPOs). GPOs negotiate pricing arrangements and contracts, sometimes on an exclusive basis, with medical supply manufacturers and distributors and these negotiated prices are made available to a GPO\u2019s affiliated hospitals and other members. If we are not one of the providers selected by a GPO, affiliated hospitals and other members may be less likely to purchase our products, and if the GPO has negotiated a strict sole source, market share compliance or bundling contract for another manufacturer\u2019s products, we may be precluded from making sales to members of the GPO for the duration of that contractual arrangement. Our failure to enter into or renew contracts with GPOs may cause us to lose market share and could adversely affect our sales.\nOur long-term success depends, in part, on intellectual property protection.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain and enforce patents, protect trade secrets, obtain licenses to technology owned by third parties and to conduct our business without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies, including ours, can be uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. There can be no assurance that if claims of any of our owned or licensed patents are challenged by one or more third parties, a court or patent authority ruling on such challenge will determine that our patent claims are valid and enforceable. If a third party is found to have rights covering products or processes used by us, we could be forced to cease using such products or processes, be subject to significant liabilities to such third party and/or be required to obtain license rights from such third party. Lawsuits involving patent claims are costly and could affect our results of operations, result in significant expense and divert the attention of managerial and scientific personnel. For more information on challenges to certain of our patents, see Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn addition, we do not know whether any of our owned or licensed pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or, if patents are issued, whether they will be dominated by third-party patent rights, provide significant proprietary protection or commercial advantage or be circumvented, opposed, invalidated, rendered unenforceable or infringed by others.\nOur intellectual property rights may be affected in ways that are difficult to anticipate at this time under the provisions of the America Invents Act enacted in 2011. This law includes a number of important changes to established practices, including transition to a first-to-file system, post-grant review for issued patents, and various procedural changes. The scope of these changes and the lack of experience with their practical implementation may result in uncertainty over the next few years.\nOn October 2, 2014, the EMA adopted its clinical transparency policy, \"Policy on Publication of Clinical Data for Medicinal Products for Human Use\" (the \u201cClinical Data Policy\u201d), which became effective on January 1, 2015. In general, under the Clinical Data Policy, clinical data is not deemed to be commercially confidential data. Therefore, there is a risk that unpublished proprietary information, including trade secrets, that are incorporated into a marketing application before the EMA may be made publicly available. While it is difficult to predict how the EMA will interpret and apply the Clinical Data Policy, any public disclosure of our trade secrets or other confidential and proprietary information may adversely impact our patent rights and our competitive advantage in the marketplace.\nAlso, different countries have different procedures for obtaining patents and patents issued by different countries provide different degrees of protection against the use of a patented invention by others. There can be no assurance that the issuance to us in one country of a patent covering an invention will be followed by the issuance in other countries of patents covering the same invention or that any judicial interpretation of the validity, enforceability or scope of the claims in a patent issued in one country will be similar to or recognized by the judicial interpretation given to a corresponding patent issued in another country.\nThe United States Patent and Trademark Office and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. While an inadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction.\nWe also rely upon unpatented, proprietary and trade secret technology that we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our collaborative partners, employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors. Despite precautions taken by us, there can be no assurance that these agreements provide meaningful protection, that they will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any such breach or that our proprietary and trade secret technologies will not otherwise become known to others or found to be non-proprietary.\nWe receive confidential and proprietary information from collaborators, prospective licensees and other third parties. In addition, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. We may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed confidential information of these third parties or our employees\u2019 former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims, which can result in significant costs if we are found to have improperly used the confidential or proprietary information of others. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of personnel and resources.\nOur products may face competition from lower cost generic or follow-on products.\nManufacturers of generic drugs are seeking to compete with our drugs and present a significant challenge to us. Those manufacturers may challenge the scope, validity or enforceability of our patents in court, requiring us to engage in complex, lengthy and costly litigation. If any of our owned or licensed patents are infringed or challenged, we may not be successful in enforcing or defending those intellectual property rights and, as a result, may not be able to develop or market the relevant product exclusively, which would have a material adverse effect on our sales from that product. In addition, manufacturers of innovative drugs as well as generic drug manufacturers may be able to design their products around our owned or licensed patents and compete with us using the resulting alternative technology. For more information concerning certain pending proceedings relating to our intellectual property rights, see Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nUpon the expiration or loss of patent protection for a product, or upon the \u201cat-risk\u201d launch (despite pending patent infringement litigation against the generic product) by a manufacturer of a generic version of one of our products, we can quickly lose a significant portion of our sales of that product. In addition, if generic versions of our competitors\u2019 branded products lose their market exclusivity, our patented products may face increased competition or pricing pressure.\nOur business operates in an extremely competitive environment.\nThe pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries in which we operate are highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Our present and potential competitors include major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as specialty pharmaceutical firms, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nHematology and Oncology: Amgen, AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers-Squibb, Eisai, Gilead, Johnson & Johnson, Novartis, Pharmacyclics, Roche/Genentech, Sanofi and Takeda.\n\u2022\nInflammation and Immunology: AbbVie, Amgen, Biogen Idec, Eisai, Eli Lilly, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Pfizer, Novartis and UCB S.A.\nSome of these companies have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we have, enabling them, among other things, to make greater research and development investments. We also experience competition in drug development from universities and other research institutions, and we compete with others in acquiring technology from these sources. The pharmaceutical industry has undergone, and is expected to continue to undergo, rapid and significant technological change and we expect competition to intensify as technical advances are made and become more widely known. The development of products or processes by our competitors with significant advantages over those that we are developing could adversely affect our future revenues and profitability.\nA decline in general economic conditions would adversely affect our results of operations.\nSales of our products are dependent, in large part, on third-party payers. As a result of global credit and financial market conditions, these organizations may be unable to satisfy their reimbursement obligations or may delay payment. For information about amounts receivable from the government-owned or -controlled hospitals in Spain, Italy and Portugal, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nIn addition, due to tightened global credit, there may be a disruption or delay in the performance of our third-party contractors, suppliers or collaborators. We rely on third parties for several important aspects of our business, including portions of our product manufacturing, clinical development of future collaboration products, conduct of clinical trials and supply of raw materials. If such third parties are unable to satisfy their commitments to us, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe may be required to modify our business practices, pay fines and significant expenses or experience other losses due to governmental investigations or other enforcement activities.\nWe may become subject to litigation or governmental investigations in the United States and foreign jurisdictions that may arise from the conduct of our business. Like many companies in our industry, we have from time to time received inquiries and subpoenas and other types of information requests from government authorities and we have been subject to claims and other actions related to our business activities. For more information relating to governmental investigations and other legal proceedings, see Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWhile the ultimate outcomes of investigations and legal proceedings are difficult to predict, adverse resolutions or settlements of those matters could result in, among other things:\n\u2022\nsignificant damage awards, fines, penalties or other payments, and administrative remedies, such as exclusion and/or debarment from government programs, or other rulings that preclude us from operating our business in a certain manner;\n\u2022\nchanges and additional costs to our business operations to avoid risks associated with such litigation or investigations;\n\u2022\nproduct recalls;\n\u2022\nreputational damage and decreased demand for our products; and\n\u2022\nexpenditure of significant time and resources that would otherwise be available for operating our business.\nThe development of new biopharmaceutical products involves a lengthy and complex process and we may be unable to commercialize any of the products we are currently developing.\nMany of our drug candidates are in the early or mid-stages of research and development and will require the commitment of substantial financial resources, extensive research, development, preclinical testing, clinical trials, manufacturing scale-up and regulatory approval prior to being ready for sale. This process takes many years of effort without any assurance of ultimate success. Our product development efforts with respect to a product candidate may fail for many reasons, including:\n\u2022\nthe failure of the product candidate in preclinical or clinical studies;\n\u2022\nadverse patient reactions to the product candidate or indications of other safety concerns;\n\u2022\ninsufficient clinical trial data to support the effectiveness or superiority of the product candidate;\n\u2022\nour inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of the product candidate for development or commercialization activities in a timely and cost-efficient manner;\n\u2022\nour failure to obtain, or delays in obtaining, the required regulatory approvals for the product candidate, the facilities or the process used to manufacture the product candidate;\n\u2022\nchanges in the regulatory environment, including pricing and reimbursement, that make development of a new product or of an existing product for a new indication no longer attractive;\n\u2022\nthe failure to obtain or maintain satisfactory drug reimbursement rates by governmental or third-party payers; and\n\u2022\nthe development of a competitive product or therapy.\nThe stem cell products that we are developing through our CCT subsidiary may represent substantial departures from established treatment methods and will compete with a number of traditional products and therapies which are now, or may be in the future, manufactured and marketed by major pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies. Furthermore, public attitudes may be influenced by claims that stem cell therapy is unsafe and stem cell therapy may not gain the acceptance of the public or the medical community.\nIf a product were to fail to be approved or if sales fail to materialize for a newly approved product, we may incur losses related to the write-down of inventory, impairment of property, plant and equipment dedicated to the product or expenses related to restructuring.\nDisruptions of our manufacturing and distribution operations could significantly interrupt our production and distribution capabilities.\nWe have our own manufacturing facilities for many of our products and we have contracted with third parties to provide other manufacturing, finishing, and packaging services. Any of those manufacturing processes could be partially or completely disrupted by fire, contamination, natural disaster, terrorist attack or governmental action. A disruption could lead to substantial production delays and the need to establish alternative manufacturing sources for the affected products requiring additional regulatory\napprovals. In the interim, our finished goods inventories may be insufficient to satisfy customer orders on a timely basis. Further, our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for any losses that may occur.\nIn all the countries where we sell our products, governmental regulations define standards for manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distributing and storing pharmaceutical products. Our failure to comply, or the failure of our contract manufacturers and distributors to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on them or us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, disgorgement, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions.\nWe have contracted with distributors to distribute REVLIMID\u00ae, THALOMID\u00ae, VIDAZA\u00ae, ABRAXANE\u00ae, POMALYST\u00ae/IMNOVID\u00ae, ISTODAX\u00ae and OTEZLA\u00ae. If our distributors fail to perform and we cannot secure a replacement distributor within a reasonable period of time, our revenue could be adversely affected.\nThe consolidation of drug wholesalers and other wholesaler actions could increase competitive and pricing pressures.\nWe sell our pharmaceutical products in the United States primarily through wholesale distributors and contracted pharmacies. These wholesale customers comprise a significant part of our distribution network for pharmaceutical products in the United States. This distribution network is continuing to undergo significant consolidation. As a result, a smaller number of large wholesale distributors and pharmacy chains control a significant share of the market. We expect that consolidation of drug wholesalers and pharmacy chains will increase competitive and pricing pressures on pharmaceutical manufacturers, including us. In addition, wholesalers may apply pricing pressure through fee-for-service arrangements and their purchases may exceed customer demand, resulting in increased returns or reduced wholesaler purchases in later periods.\nRisks from the improper conduct of employees, agents, contractors or collaborators could adversely affect our business or reputation.\nWe cannot ensure that our compliance controls, policies and procedures will in every instance protect us from acts committed by our employees, agents, contractors or collaborators that violate the laws or regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including employment, anti-corruption, environmental, competition and privacy laws. Such improper actions, particularly with respect to foreign healthcare professionals and government officials, could subject us to civil or criminal investigations, monetary and injunctive penalties, adversely impact our ability to conduct business in certain markets, negatively affect our results of operations and damage our reputation.\nWe are subject to a variety of risks related to the conduct and expansion of our business internationally, particularly in emerging markets.\nAs our operations expand globally, we are subject to risks associated with conducting business in foreign markets, particularly in emerging markets. Those risks include:\n\u2022\nincreased management, travel, infrastructure and legal compliance costs;\n\u2022\nlonger payment and reimbursement cycles;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable;\n\u2022\nlocal marketing and promotional challenges;\n\u2022\nlack of consistency, and unexpected changes, in foreign regulatory requirements and practices;\n\u2022\nincreased risk of governmental and regulatory scrutiny and investigations;\n\u2022\nincreased exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nthe burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and legal standards;\n\u2022\noperating in locations with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign sales and development operations;\n\u2022\nimport and export requirements, tariffs, taxes and other trade barriers;\n\u2022\nweak or no protection of intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\npossible enactment of laws regarding the management of and access to data and public networks and websites;\n\u2022\npossible future limitations on foreign-owned businesses;\n\u2022\nincreased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities; and\n\u2022\nother factors beyond our control, including political, social and economic instability, popular uprisings, war, terrorist attacks and security concerns in general.\nAs we continue to expand our business into multiple international markets, our success will depend, in large part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations. Any of these risks could harm our international operations and reduce our sales, adversely affecting our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions and strategic initiatives.\nWe may face significant challenges in effectively integrating entities and businesses that we acquire and we may not realize the benefits anticipated from such acquisitions. Achieving the anticipated benefits of our acquired businesses will depend in part upon whether we can integrate our businesses in an efficient and effective manner. Our integration of acquired businesses involves a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\ndemands on management related to the increase in our size after an acquisition;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from daily operations to the integration of acquired businesses and personnel;\n\u2022\nhigher than anticipated integration costs;\n\u2022\nfailure to achieve expected synergies and costs savings;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the assimilation and retention of employees;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the assimilation of different cultures and practices, as well as in the assimilation of broad and geographically dispersed personnel and operations; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the integration of departments, systems, including accounting systems, technologies, books and records and procedures, as well as in maintaining uniform standards and controls, including internal control over financial reporting, and related procedures and policies.\nIn addition, we may not be able to realize the projected benefits of corporate strategic initiatives we may pursue in the future.\nWe may not be able to continue to attract and retain highly qualified managerial, scientific, manufacturing and commercial talent.\nThe success of our business depends, in large part, on our continued ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial, scientific, medical, manufacturing, commercial and other professional personnel, and competition for these types of personnel is intense. We cannot be sure that we will be able to attract or retain skilled personnel or that the costs of doing so will not materially increase.\nRisks associated with using hazardous materials in our business could subject us to significant liability.\nWe use certain hazardous materials in our research, development, manufacturing and other business activities. If an accident or environmental discharge occurs, or if we discover contamination caused by prior owners and operators of properties we acquire, we could be liable for remediation obligations, damages and fines that could exceed our insurance coverage and financial resources. Additionally, the cost of compliance with environmental and safety laws and regulations may increase in the future, requiring us to expend more financial resources either in compliance or in purchasing supplemental insurance coverage.\nProduct liability claims could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nProduct liability claims could result in significant damage awards or settlements. Such claims can also be accompanied by consumer fraud claims or claims by third-party payers seeking reimbursement of the cost of our products. In addition, adverse determinations or settlements of product liability claims may result in suspension or withdrawal of a product marketing authorization or changes to our product labeling, including restrictions on therapeutic indications, inclusion of new contraindications, warnings or precautions. Although we purchase product liability coverage from third-party carriers, it is increasingly difficult and costly to obtain. There can be no assurance that we will be able to recover under any insurance policy or that such coverage will be adequate to fully cover all risks or damage awards or settlements. Product liability claims, regardless of their merits or ultimate outcome, are costly, divert management's attention, may harm our reputation and can impact the demand for our products.\nChanges in our effective income tax rate could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to income taxes in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions and our domestic and international tax liabilities are largely dependent upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions. Various factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our effective income tax rate. These factors include interpretations of existing tax laws, the accounting for stock options and other share-based compensation, changes in tax laws and rates, future levels of research and development spending, changes in accounting standards, changes in the mix of earnings in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate, the outcome of examinations by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, the accuracy of our estimates for unrecognized tax benefits and realization of deferred tax assets and changes in overall levels of pre-tax earnings. The impact on our income tax provision resulting from the above-mentioned factors and others could have a material impact on our results of operations. For more information, see Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCurrency fluctuations and changes in exchange rates could adversely affect our revenue growth, increase our costs and cause our profitability to decline.\nWe collect and pay a substantial portion of our sales and expenditures in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Therefore, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect our operating results. We utilize foreign currency forward contracts and occasionally foreign currency put and call options, all of which are derivative instruments, to manage foreign currency risk. We use these derivative instruments to hedge certain forecasted transactions, manage exchange rate volatility in the translation of foreign earnings and reduce exposures to foreign currency fluctuations of certain balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. The use of these derivative instruments is intended to mitigate a portion of the exposure of these risks with the intent to reduce our risk or cost, but generally would not fully offset any change in operating results as a consequence of fluctuations in foreign currencies. Any significant foreign exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 7A. \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe may experience an adverse market reaction if we are unable to meet our financial reporting obligations.\nAs we continue to expand at a rapid pace, the development of new and/or improved automated systems will remain an ongoing priority. During this expansion period, our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements in our financial reporting. Such misstatements may result in litigation and/or negative publicity and possibly cause an adverse market reaction that may negatively impact our growth plans and the value of our common stock.\nImpairment charges or write downs in our books and changes in accounting standards could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nNew or revised accounting standards, rules and interpretations could result in changes to the recognition of income and expense that may materially and adversely affect our financial results. In addition, the value allocated to certain of our assets could be substantially impaired due to a number of factors beyond our control. Also, if any of our strategic equity investments decline in value, we may be required to write down such investment.\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market for our shares of common stock may fluctuate significantly. The following key factors may have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock:\n\u2022\nresults of our clinical trials or adverse events associated with our marketed products;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our commercial and operating results;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technical or product developments by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions for pharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks in particular;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and governmental regulations, including changes in tax, healthcare, environmental, competition and patent laws;\n\u2022\nnew accounting pronouncements or regulatory rulings;\n\u2022\npublic announcements regarding medical advances in the treatment of the disease states that we are targeting;\n\u2022\npatent or proprietary rights developments;\n\u2022\nchanges in pricing and third-party reimbursement policies for our products;\n\u2022\nthe outcome of litigation involving our products, processes or intellectual property;\n\u2022\nthe existence and outcome of governmental investigations and proceedings;\n\u2022\nregulatory actions that may impact our products or potential products;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in our manufacturing processes or supply chain;\n\u2022\nfailure of our collaboration partners to successfully develop potential drug candidates;\n\u2022\ncompetition; and\n\u2022\ninvestor reaction to announcements regarding business or product acquisitions.\nIn addition, a market downturn in general and/or in the biopharmaceutical sector in particular, may adversely affect the market price of our securities, which may not necessarily reflect the actual or perceived value of our Company.\nOur business would be adversely affected if we are unable to service our debt obligations.\nWe have incurred various forms of indebtedness, including senior notes, commercial paper and a senior unsecured credit facility. Our ability to pay interest and principal amounts when due, comply with debt covenants or repurchase the senior notes if a change of control occurs, will depend upon, among other things, continued commercial success of our products and other factors that affect our future financial and operating performance, including prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and regulatory factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service the debt service requirements under our debt instruments, we may be forced to take remedial actions such as:\n\u2022\nrestructuring or refinancing our debt;\n\u2022\nseeking additional debt or equity capital;\n\u2022\nreducing or delaying our business activities, acquisitions, investments or capital expenditures, including research and development expenditures; or\n\u2022\nselling assets, businesses, products or other potential revenue streams.\nSuch measures might not be successful and might not enable us to service our debt obligations. In addition, any such financing, refinancing or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms, if at all.\nA breakdown or breach of our information technology systems could subject us to liability or interrupt the operation of our business.\nWe rely upon our information technology systems and infrastructure for our business. The size and complexity of our computer systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown and unauthorized intrusion. We could also experience a business\ninterruption, theft of confidential information, or reputational damage from industrial espionage attacks, malware or other cyber attacks, which may compromise our system infrastructure or lead to data leakage, either internally or at our third-party providers.\nSimilarly, data privacy breaches by those who access our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information belonging to us, our patients, employees, customers or other business partners, may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. There can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our data and information technology systems will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business and result in financial and reputational harm to us.\nThe illegal distribution and sale by third parties of counterfeit versions of our products or stolen products could have a negative impact on our reputation and business.\nThird parties might illegally distribute and sell counterfeit or unfit versions of our products, which do not meet our rigorous manufacturing and testing standards. A patient who receives a counterfeit or unfit drug may be at risk for a number of dangerous health consequences. Our reputation and business could suffer harm as a result of counterfeit or unfit drugs sold under our brand name. In addition, thefts of inventory at warehouses, plants or while in-transit, which are not properly stored and which are sold through unauthorized channels, could adversely impact patient safety, our reputation and our business.\nWe have certain charter and by-law provisions that may deter a third-party from acquiring us and may impede the stockholders\u2019 ability to remove and replace our management or board of directors.\nOur board of directors has the authority to issue, at any time, without further stockholder approval, up to 5.0 million shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights, privileges and preferences of those shares. An issuance of preferred stock could discourage a third-party from acquiring a majority of our outstanding voting stock. Additionally, our by-laws contain provisions intended to strengthen the board\u2019s position in the event of a hostile takeover attempt. These provisions could impede the stockholders\u2019 ability to remove and replace our management and/or board of directors. Furthermore, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an anti-takeover law, which may also dissuade a potential acquirer of our common stock.\nIn addition to the risks relating to our common stock, holders of our CVRs are subject to additional risks.\nOn October 15, 2010, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Abraxis BioScience, Inc. (Abraxis) and in connection with our acquisition, contingent value rights (CVRs) were issued entitling each holder of a CVR to a pro rata portion of certain milestone and net sales payments if certain specified conditions are satisfied. In addition to the risks relating to our common stock, CVR holders are subject to additional risks, including:\n\u2022\nan active public market for the CVRs may not continue to exist or the CVRs may trade at low volumes, both of which could have an adverse effect on the market price of the CVRs;\n\u2022\nif the clinical approval milestones or net sales targets specified in the CVR Agreement are not achieved within the time periods specified, no payment will be made and the CVRs will expire valueless;\n\u2022\nsince the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the CVRs is unclear, any part of a CVR payment could be treated as ordinary income and the tax thereon may be required to be paid prior to the receipt of the CVR payment;\n\u2022\nany payments in respect of the CVRs are subordinated to the right of payment of certain of our other indebtedness;\n\u2022\nwe may under certain circumstances redeem the CVRs; and\n\u2022\nupon expiration of our obligations under the CVR Agreement to continue to commercialize ABRAXANE\u00ae or any of the other Abraxis pipeline products, we may discontinue such efforts, which would have an adverse effect on the value of the CVRs.", "PERMNO": 11552, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "CELG"}
