{"cik": "704415", "company": "HEALTHWAYS, INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn the execution of our business strategy, our operations and financial condition are subject to certain risks. A summary of certain material risks is provided below, and you should take such risks into account in evaluating any investment decision involving the Company. This section does not describe all risks applicable to us and is intended only as a summary of certain material factors that could impact our operations in the industry in which we operate. Other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this \"Report\") contain additional information concerning these and other risks.\nWe depend on payments from customers, and cost reduction pressure on our customers may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe healthcare industry currently faces significant cost reduction pressures as a result of increased competition, constrained revenues from governmental and private sources, increasing underlying medical care costs and general economic conditions. We believe that these pressures will continue and possibly intensify.\nWe believe that our solutions, which are geared to foster well-being improvement by engaging people in health improvement programs, specifically assist our customers in controlling the costs of healthcare; however, the pressures to reduce costs in the short term may negatively affect our ability to sign and/or retain contracts under existing terms or to restructure these contracts on terms that would not have a material negative impact on our results of operations. These financial pressures could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nA significant percentage of our revenues is derived from health plan customers.\nA significant percentage of our revenues is derived from health plan customers. The health plan industry continues to consolidate, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain health plan customers if they are acquired by other health plans that already participate in competing programs or are not interested in our programs. In addition, a reduction in the number of covered lives enrolled with our health plan customers or a decision by our health plan customers to take programs in-house could adversely affect our results of operations. Our health plan customers are subject to increased obligations under PPACA, including benefit mandates, limitations on exclusions and factors used for rate setting, requirements for MLRs, and increased taxes. In determining how to meet these requirements, current or prospective customers may seek reduced fees or choose to reduce or delay the purchase of our services.\nIn addition, PPACA required that each state establish or participate in an Exchange (as defined above) where individuals may compare and purchase health insurance. Health plans participating in an Exchange must offer a set of minimum benefits, known as \"essential health benefits,\" and may elect to offer additional benefits. Chronic disease management is one of the ten essential health benefits. The parameters of the chronic disease management benefit may vary based upon each state's specific benchmark plan which sets the standard for each market. It is possible that our services will not qualify under these standards in some or all states. We cannot predict whether individuals who are currently receiving our services will switch to health plans offered through the Exchanges that do not include our services. If we are unable to provide services to health plans participating in Exchanges, if health plans in the Exchanges that engage our services are not successful, or if the Exchanges otherwise reduce the number of members receiving our services or the payments we receive, our results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nWe currently derive a significant percentage of our revenues from one customer.\nBecause of the size of its membership, Humana comprised approximately 11.6% of our revenues in 2014. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our revenues in 2014. Our primary contract with Humana continues through 2016. The loss or restructuring of a contract with, Humana or other large customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur business strategy is dependent in part on developing new and additional products and services to complement our existing products and services, as well as establishing additional distribution channels through which we may offer our products and services.\nOur strategy focuses on helping people adopt and/or maintain healthy behaviors, reducing health-related risk factors, and optimizing care for identified health conditions. While we have considerable experience in solutions for a broad range of health conditions, any new or modified programs will involve inherent risks of execution, such as our ability to implement our programs within expected timelines or cost estimates; our ability to obtain adequate financing to provide the capital that may be necessary to support our operations and to support or guarantee our performance under new contracts; and our ability to deliver outcomes on any new products or services. In addition, as part of our business strategy, we may enter into relationships to establish additional distribution channels through which we may offer our products and services. As we offer products through new or alternative distribution channels, we may face difficulties, such as potential customer overlap, which may lead to pricing conflicts, which may adversely affect our business.\nOur business strategy relating to the development and introduction of new products and services exposes us to risks such as limited customer acceptance and additional expenditures that may not result in additional net revenue.\nAn important component of our business strategy is to focus on new products and services that enable us to provide immediate value to our customers, such as Dr. Dean Ornish's Lifestyle Management Programs. Customer acceptance of these new products and services cannot be predicted with certainty, and if we fail to execute properly on this strategy or to adapt this strategy as market conditions evolve, our ability to grow revenue and our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to successfully implement our business strategy, our financial performance and our growth could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur future financial performance and success are dependent in large part upon our ability to implement our business strategy successfully. Implementation of our strategy will require effective management of our operational, financial and human resources and will place significant demands on those resources. See Item 1. \"Business - Business Strategy\" for more information regarding our business strategy. There are risks involved in pursuing our strategy, including the following:\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to hire or retain the personnel necessary to manage our strategy effectively.\n\u2022\nWe may be unsuccessful in implementing improvements to operational efficiency and such efforts may not yield the intended result.\n\u2022\nExecution of our strategy may cause us to incur substantial implementation costs, make substantial investments in technology and/or incur additional indebtedness, which may divert capital away from our traditional business operations.\nIn addition to the risks set forth above, implementation of our business strategy could be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, such as increased competition, legal developments, government regulation, general economic conditions, increased operating costs or expenses, and changes in industry trends. We may decide to alter or discontinue certain aspects of our business strategy at any time. If we are not able to implement our business strategy successfully, our long-term growth and profitability may be adversely affected. Even if we are able to implement some or all of the initiatives of our business strategy successfully, our operating results may not improve to the extent we anticipate, or at all.\nOur inability to renew and/or maintain contracts with our customers could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIf our customers choose not to renew their contracts with us, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. No contracts subject to renewal in 2015 individually represent 2% or more of our 2014 revenues.\nFailure to successfully execute on the terms of our contracts could result in significant harm to our business.\nOur ability to grow and expand our business is contingent upon our ability to achieve desired performance metrics, cost savings, and/or clinical outcomes improvements under our existing contracts and to favorably resolve contract billing and interpretation issues with our customers. Some of our contracts place a portion of our fees at risk or provide for gain share opportunity based on achieving such metrics, savings, and/or improvements. We cannot guarantee that we will achieve and reach mutual agreement with customers with respect to contractually required performance metrics, cost savings and/or clinical outcomes improvements under our contracts within the expected time frames. Unusual and unforeseen patterns of healthcare utilization by individuals with diseases or conditions for which we provide services could adversely affect our ability to achieve desired performance metrics, cost savings, and clinical outcomes. Our inability to meet or exceed the targets under our customer contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Also, our ability to provide financial guidance with respect to performance-based contracts is contingent upon our ability to accurately forecast variables that affect performance and the timing of revenue recognition under the terms of our contracts ahead of data collection and reconciliation.\nIn addition, certain of our contracts are increasing in complexity, requiring integration of data, systems, people, programs and services, the execution of sophisticated business activities, and the delivery of a broad array of services to large numbers of people who may be geographically dispersed. The failure to successfully manage and execute the terms of these agreements could result in the loss of fees and/or contracts and could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe depend on the timely receipt of accurate data from our customers and our accurate analysis of such data.\nIdentifying which members may benefit from receiving our services and measuring our performance under our contracts are highly dependent upon the timely receipt of accurate data from our customers and our accurate analysis of such data. Data acquisition, data quality control and data analysis are complex processes that carry a risk of untimely, incomplete or inaccurate data from our customers or flawed analysis of such data, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to recognize revenues.\nOur ability to achieve estimated annualized revenue in backlog is based on certain estimates.\nOur ability to achieve estimated annualized revenue in backlog in the manner and within the timeframe we expect is based on certain estimates regarding the implementation of our services. We cannot assure you that the amounts in backlog will ultimately result in revenues in the manner and within the timeframe we expect.\nChanges in macroeconomic conditions may adversely affect our business.\nEconomic difficulties and other macroeconomic conditions could reduce the demand and/or the timing of purchases for certain of our services from customers and potential customers. Loss of a significant customer or a reduction in a customer's enrolled lives could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, changes in economic conditions could create liquidity and credit constraints. We cannot assure you that we would be able to secure additional financing if needed and, if such funds were available, that the terms and conditions would be acceptable to us.\nThe continued expansion of our services into international markets subjects us to additional business, regulatory and financial risks.\nWe provide health improvement programs and services in Brazil, Australia, and France, and we intend to continue expanding our international operations as part of our business strategy. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur costs in connection with pursuing business opportunities in international markets. Our success in the international markets will depend in part on our ability to anticipate the rate of market acceptance of our solutions and the individual market dynamics and regulatory requirements in potential international markets. Because the international market for our services is still developing and also involves many new solutions, there is no guarantee that we will be able to achieve the necessary cost savings and clinical outcomes improvements under our contracts with international customers within the expected time frames and reach mutual agreement with customers with respect to those outcomes. The failure to accurately forecast the costs of implementing our strategy of establishing a presence in these markets could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, as a result of doing business in foreign markets, we are subject to a variety of additional risks that are different from the risks we face within the United States. Our future operating results in these countries or in other countries or regions throughout the world could be negatively affected by a variety of factors that are beyond our control. These factors include political conditions, economic conditions, legal and regulatory constraints, currency regulations, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future. In addition, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our future costs or on future cash flows from our international operations, and could adversely affect our financial performance. Other factors that may impact our international operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies both of the United States and of other countries, laws, regulations, and other activities of foreign governments, agencies, and similar organizations. Additional risks inherent in our international operations generally include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the United States.\nWe may experience difficulties associated with the implementation and/or integration of new businesses, services (including outsourced services), technologies, solutions, or products.\nWe may face substantial difficulties, costs, and delays in effectively implementing and/or integrating acquired businesses, services (including outsourced services), or technologies into our platform. Implementing internally-developed solutions and/or integrating newly acquired businesses, services (including outsourced services), and technologies could be costly and time-consuming and may strain our resources. Consequently, we may not be successful in implementing and/or integrating these new businesses, services, or technologies and may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits.\nThe performance of our business and the level of our indebtedness could prevent us from meeting the obligations under our debt agreement or the cash convertible senior notes or have an adverse effect on our future financial condition, our ability to raise additional capital, or our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry.\nOn June 8, 2012, we entered into the Fifth Amended and Restated Revolving Credit and Term Loan Agreement (the \"Fifth Amended Credit Agreement\"), which was amended on February 5, 2013, March 15, 2013, July 1, 2013, April 14, 2014, and December 29, 2014. On July 16, 2013, we completed the issuance of $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of cash convertible senior notes due 2018 (the \"Cash Convertible Notes\"), and on October 1, 2013, we entered into an Investment Agreement (the \"Investment Agreement\") with CareFirst Holdings, LLC (\"CareFirst\"). Pursuant to the Investment Agreement, we issued to CareFirst a convertible subordinated promissory note in an aggregate original principal amount of $20 million (the \"CareFirst Convertible Note\"). As of December 31, 2014, our long-term debt under these arrangements, including the current portion but excluding the debt discount, was $272.5 million.\nOur ability to service our indebtedness (including the debt outstanding under the Fifth Amended Credit Agreement, the Cash Convertible Notes and the CareFirst Convertible Note) will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs.\nThe Fifth Amended Credit Agreement contains various financial covenants, restricts the payment of dividends, and limits the amount of repurchases of our common stock. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the Fifth Amended Credit Agreement, in which all amounts outstanding under the Fifth Amended Credit Agreement may become immediately due and payable, and all commitments under the Fifth Amended Credit Agreement to extend further credit may be terminated. In addition, a payment default, including an acceleration following an event of default, under the Fifth Amended Credit Agreement or under our indenture for the Cash Convertible Notes, could each trigger an event of default under the other debt instrument, which could result in the principal of and the accrued and unpaid interest on such debt becoming due and payable.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our future financial condition or our ability to react to changes in the economy or industry by, among other things:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to a downturn in general economic conditions, loss of revenue and/or profit margins in our business, or to increases in interest rates, particularly with respect to the portion of our outstanding debt that is subject to variable interest rates;\n\u2022\npotentially limiting our ability to obtain additional financing or to obtain such financing on favorable terms;\n\u2022\ncausing us to dedicate a portion of future cash flow from operations to service or pay down our debt, which reduces the cash available for other purposes, such as operations, capital expenditures, and future business opportunities; and\n\u2022\npossibly limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who may be less leveraged.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Cash Convertible Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nThe cash conversion feature of the Cash Convertible Notes (the \"Cash Conversion Derivative\") requires bifurcation from the Cash Convertible Notes in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging. In the event the conditional conversion feature of the Cash Convertible Notes is triggered, holders of Cash Convertible Notes will be entitled to convert the Cash Convertible Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Cash Convertible Notes, we would be required to pay cash to settle any such conversion, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Cash Convertible Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Cash Convertible Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which could result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nThe accounting for the Cash Convertible Notes and related cash convertible notes hedge transactions may result in volatility to our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\nThe Cash Conversion Derivative that is part of the Cash Convertible Notes is accounted for as a derivative liability pursuant to ASC Topic 470, Debt, relating to derivative instruments and hedging activities. In general, the initial valuation of the conversion option was bifurcated from the debt component of the Cash Convertible Notes and is measured at fair value each reporting period. For each financial statement period after issuance of the Cash Convertible Notes, a hedge gain (or loss) will be reported in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) to the extent the valuation of the Cash Conversion Derivative changes from the previous period. In connection with the issuance of the Cash Convertible Notes, we entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions (the \"Cash Convertible Notes Hedges\"), which are cash-settled and are recorded and carried at fair value as a derivative asset and are intended to offset the gain (or loss) associated with changes to the valuation of the Cash Conversion Derivative. Although we do not expect there to be a material net impact to our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) as a result of our issuing the Cash Convertible Notes and entering into the Cash Convertible Notes Hedges, we cannot assure you these transactions will be completely offset, which may result in volatility to our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the Cash Convertible Notes Hedges.\nThe counterparties to the Cash Convertible Notes Hedges (the \"Counterparties\") are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that these Counterparties may default or otherwise fail to perform, or may exercise certain rights to terminate their obligations, under the Cash Convertible Notes Hedges. Our exposure to the credit risk of the Counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. If one or more of the Counterparties to one or more of the Cash Convertible Notes Hedges becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under those transactions. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in the market price of our common stock and in volatility of our common stock. In addition, upon a default or other failure to perform, or a termination of obligations, by one of the Counterparties, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of the Counterparties.\nWe have a significant amount of goodwill and intangible assets, the value of which could become impaired.\nWe have recorded significant portions of the purchase price of certain acquisitions as goodwill and/or intangible assets. At December 31, 2014, we had approximately $338.8 million and $69.2 million of goodwill and intangible assets, respectively. We review goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization for impairment on an annual basis (during the fourth quarter) or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If we determine that the carrying values of our goodwill and/or intangible assets are impaired, we may incur a non-cash charge to earnings, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the period in which the impairment occurs.\nA failure of our information systems could adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to deliver our services depends on effectively using information technology. We expect to continually invest in updating and expanding our information technology capabilities. In some cases, we may have to make systems investments before we generate revenues from contracts with new customers. In addition, these system requirements expose us to technology obsolescence risks.\nWe rely upon our information systems for operating and monitoring all major aspects of our business. These systems and, therefore, our operations could be damaged or interrupted by natural disasters, power loss, network failure, improper operation by our employees, data privacy or security breaches, computer viruses, computer hacking, network penetration or other illegal intrusions or other unexpected events. Any disruption in the operation of our information systems, regardless of the cause, could adversely impact our operations, which may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA cyber-security incident could result in the loss of confidential data, give rise to remediation and other expenses, expose us to liability under HIPAA, consumer protection laws, or common law theories, subject us to litigation and federal and state governmental inquiries, damage our reputation, and otherwise be disruptive to our business.\nThe nature of our business involves the receipt and storage of a significant amount of health information about the participants in our programs. The secure maintenance of this confidential information is critical to our business operations. To protect our information systems from attack, damage and unauthorized use, we have implemented multiple layers of security, including technical safeguards, processes, and our people. Our defenses are monitored and routinely tested internally and by external parties. Despite these efforts, threats from malicious persons and groups, new vulnerabilities, and advanced attacks against information systems create risk of cyber security incidents. There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to cyber security incidents that bypass our security measures, result in loss of personal health information or other data subject to privacy laws or disrupt our information systems or business. As a result, cyber-security and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices remain a priority for us. We may be required to expend significant additional resources in our efforts to modify or enhance our protective measures against evolving threats or to investigate and remediate any cyber security vulnerabilities. The occurrence of a breach in security of our systems or those of our third-party vendors and other service providers could result in interruptions, delays, the loss, access, misappropriation, disclosure or corruption of data, liability under privacy, security and consumer protection laws or litigation under these or other laws, including common law theories, and subject us to federal and state governmental inquiries, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and harm our business reputation.\nIf we lose the services of our Chief Executive Officer or other members of our senior management team, we may not be able to execute our business strategy.\nWe believe that our success depends in significant part upon the continued service of our senior management team. In particular, we believe that our Chief Executive Officer, Ben R. Leedle, Jr., is critical to our strategic direction and is uniquely positioned to lead the Company through the current business environment in the healthcare industry that is largely due to the changes resulting from healthcare reform. The loss of our Chief Executive Officer, even temporarily, or any other member of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe face competition for staffing, which may increase our labor costs and reduce profitability.\nWe compete with other healthcare and services providers in recruiting qualified management, including executives with the required skills and experience to operate and grow our business, and staff personnel for the day-to-day operations of our business and well-being improvement call centers, including nurses, health coaches, and other healthcare professionals. In some markets, the scarcity of nurses, experienced health coaches, and other medical support personnel has become a significant operating issue to healthcare businesses. These challenges may require us to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain qualified management and other professionals. A failure to attract and retain qualified management, nurses, health coaches, and other healthcare professionals, or to control labor costs, could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.\nOur industry is a rapidly evolving and highly competitive segment of the healthcare industry.\nThe rapidly growing industry in which we operate is an evolving segment of the overall healthcare industry with many entities marketing or announcing an intention to offer a variety of total population health improvement services and other services to health plans, integrated healthcare systems, self-insured employers, and government entities. The financial, research, staff, and marketing resources of these entities may exceed our resources,\nWe believe we have advantages over our competitors because of the breadth and depth of our well-being improvement capabilities, including our scope of strategic relationships, state-of-the-art proprietary information technology, predictive modeling capabilities, behavior-change techniques, the comprehensive recruitment and training of our clinical colleagues, our experienced management team, the comprehensive clinical nature of our product offerings, our established reputation for providing well-being improvement services to members with health risk factors or chronic diseases, and the proven financial and clinical outcomes of our programs. However, we cannot assure you that we can compete effectively with other companies.\nWe are party to litigation that could force us to pay significant damages and/or harm our reputation.\nWe are subject to certain legal proceedings, which potentially involve large claims and significant defense costs (see Item 3. \"Legal Proceedings\"). These legal proceedings and any other claims that we may face, whether with or without merit, could result in costly litigation, and divert the time, attention, and resources of our management. Although we currently maintain various types of liability insurance, there can be no assurance that the coverage limits of such insurance policies will be adequate or that all such claims will be covered by insurance. Although we believe that we have conducted our operations in full compliance with applicable statutory and contractual requirements and that we have meritorious defenses to outstanding claims, it is possible that resolution of these legal matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, legal expenses associated with the defense of these matters may be material to our results of operations in a particular financial reporting period.\nCompliance with federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives could adversely affect our results of operations or may require us to spend substantial amounts acquiring and implementing new information systems or modifying existing systems.\nOur customers are subject to considerable state and federal government regulation. Many of these regulations are vaguely written and subject to differing interpretations that may, in certain cases, result in unintended consequences that could impact our ability to effectively deliver services.\nWe believe that federal requirements governing the confidentiality of individually-identifiable health information permit us to obtain individually-identifiable health information for well-being improvement purposes from a covered entity; however, state laws or regulations could impose additional and more restrictive privacy and security restrictions. We are required to comply with most requirements of the HIPAA privacy and security laws and regulations and may be subject to criminal or civil penalties for violations of these regulations. In addition, impermissible uses and disclosures of unsecured individually identifiable health information are presumed to be breaches for which notice must be made by us or our customers to affected individuals and, in some cases, the media, unless it can be demonstrated that there is a low probability that the information has been compromised.\nAlthough we continually monitor the extent to which federal and state legislation and regulations govern our operations, new federal or state legislation or regulations that restrict our ability to obtain and handle individually-identifiable health information or that otherwise restrict our operations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nGovernment regulators may interpret current regulations or adopt new legislation governing our operations in a manner that subjects us to penalties or negatively impacts our ability to provide services.\nBroadly written Medicare fraud and abuse laws and regulations may be subject to varying interpretations, which may expose us to potential civil and criminal litigation regarding the structure of current and past contracts entered into with our customers.\nExpanding the well-being and health management industry to Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans could lead to increased direct regulation of well-being and health management services. Further, providing services to Medicare Advantage beneficiaries may result in our being subject directly to various federal laws and regulations, including the federal False Claims Act, billing and reimbursement requirements and other provisions related to fraud and abuse.\nIn addition, certain of our services, including health utilization management and certain claims payment functions, require licensure by government agencies. We are subject to a variety of legal requirements in order to obtain and maintain such licenses, but little guidance is available to determine the scope of some of these requirements. Failure to obtain and maintain any required licenses or failure to comply with other laws and regulations applicable to our business could have a material negative impact on our operations.\nCertain of our professional healthcare employees, such as nurses, must comply with individual licensing requirements.\nAll of our healthcare professionals who are subject to licensing requirements, such as the professionals located at a well-being improvement call center, are licensed in the state in which they are physically present. Multiple state licensing requirements for healthcare professionals who provide services telephonically over state lines may require us to license some of our healthcare professionals in more than one state. We continually monitor legislative, regulatory, and judicial developments in telemedicine; however, new agency interpretations, federal or state legislation or regulations, or judicial decisions could increase the requirement for multi-state licensing of all well-being improvement call center health professionals, which could increase our costs of services and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nHealthcare reform legislation may result in a reduction to our revenues from government health programs and private insurance companies.\nAmong other things, PPACA decreases the number of uninsured individuals and expands coverage through the expansion of public programs, increased access to private sector health insurance and a number of health insurance market reforms. PPACA also encourages utilization of preventive services and wellness programs, such as those provided by the Company. However, PPACA also directly affects our customers or prospective customers and may increase their costs and/or reduce their revenues. For example, PPACA prohibits commercial health plans from using gender, health status, family history, or occupation to set premium rates, eliminates pre-existing condition exclusions, and bans annual benefit limits. In addition, PPACA mandates minimum MLRs for health plans such that the percentage of health coverage premium revenue spent on healthcare medical costs and quality improvement expenses must be at least 80% for individual and small group health plans and 85% for large group coverage and Medicare Advantage plans, with policyholders receiving rebates, and CMS receiving refunds in the case of Medicare Advantage plans, if the actual loss ratios fall below these minimums. PPACA provides for reductions in funding to Medicare Advantage programs, which may cause some Medicare Advantage plans to raise beneficiary premiums or limit benefits.\nWhile we believe that our programs and services specifically assist our customers in controlling their costs and improving their competitiveness, it is possible that the reforms imposed by PPACA will adversely affect the profitability of our customers and cause our customers or prospective customers to reduce or delay the purchase of our services or to demand reduced fees. Further, demand for our programs could be reduced if Medicare Advantage plans respond to PPACA funding reductions or other changes by eliminating our programs or by limiting or changing benefits in a manner that causes some Medicare Advantage beneficiaries to terminate their Medicare Advantage coverage.\nBecause of PPACA's complexity, lack of implementing regulations or interpretive guidance, gradual and potentially delayed implementation, remaining or new court challenges, and possible amendment or repeal, we are unable to predict all of the ways in which PPACA could impact the Company. We could also be impacted by future healthcare reform legislative initiatives and/or government regulation.\nWe are exploring and evaluating strategic alternatives for the Company, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in consummating a viable strategic alternative, that any such strategic alternative will yield additional value for stockholders, or that the process will not have an adverse impact on our business.\nIn January 2015, we announced that we retained J.P. Morgan Securities LLC as financial advisor to assist in exploring and evaluating a broad range of strategic alternatives. No decision has been made to enter into any transaction at this time, and there can be no assurances that this evaluation will result in any specific transaction. The process of exploring strategic alternatives may be time-consuming and disruptive to our business operations, and if we are unable to effectively manage the process, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, identifying and evaluating potential strategic alternatives may result in the incurrence of expenses and could expose us to increased risk of claims or other litigation arising from the pursuit of one or more transactions.\nAny strategic decision will involve risks and uncertainties, and we cannot assure you that any potential transaction or other strategic alternative, if identified, evaluated and consummated, will provide greater value to our stockholders than that reflected in the current stock price. Any potential transaction would be dependent upon a number of factors that may be beyond our control, including, among other factors, market conditions, industry trends and the interest of third parties in our business.\nWe do not intend to comment regarding the evaluation of strategic alternatives until such time as our board of directors has determined the outcome of the process or otherwise has deemed that disclosure is appropriate. As a consequence, perceived uncertainties related to the future of the Company may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners.", "PERMNO": 76788, "SIC": 8090, "TIC": "TVTY"}
