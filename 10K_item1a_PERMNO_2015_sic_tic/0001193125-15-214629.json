{"cik": "1592329", "company": "Clifton Bancorp Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-06-05", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in shares of our common stock involves various risks. Before deciding to invest in our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below in conjunction with the other information in this annual report on Form 10-K and information incorporated by reference into this annual report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed by any of the following risks or by other risks that have not been identified or that we may believe are immaterial or unlikely. The value or market price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. The risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements.\nChanges in interest rates may hurt our profits and asset value and our strategies for managing interest rate risk may not be effective.\nLike other financial institutions, we are subject to interest rate risk. Our primary source of income is net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings. Changes in the general level of interest rates can affect our net interest income by affecting the difference between the weighted-average yield earned on our interest-earning assets and the weighted-average rate paid on our interest-bearing liabilities, or interest rate spread, and the average life of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Changes in interest rates also can affect: (1) our ability to originate loans; (2) the value of our interest-earning assets and our ability to realize gains from the sale of such assets; (3) our ability to obtain and retain deposits in competition with other available investment alternatives; and (4) the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, particularly adjustable or variable rate loans. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including government monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control.\nAt March 31, 2015, in the event of a 200 basis point increase in interest rates, we would be expected to experience a 17.84% decrease in net portfolio value and a $624,000, or 2.39%, decrease in net interest income. Consequently, our profitability could be adversely affected as a result of changes in interest rates.\nIn order to decrease interest rate risk, we utilize a variety of asset and liability management strategies such as increasing the amount of adjustable rate loans and short term investments, as well as using longer term Federal Home Loan Bank advances. In addition, we price longer term certificates of deposit at an attractive rate to extend the average term of our deposits. Due to market conditions and customer demand, these strategies may not be effective in decreasing our interest rate risk. In addition, our interest rate risk mitigation strategies may be influenced by regulatory guidance and directives. As a result, we may be required to take actions that, while mitigating our interest rate risk, may negatively impact our earnings.\nIf our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our results of operations would be negatively affected.\nIn determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we analyze our loss and delinquency experience by loan categories and we consider the effect of existing economic conditions. In addition, we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. If the results of our analyses are incorrect, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, which would require additions to our allowance and would decrease our net income. Our emphasis on loan growth and on increasing our portfolio of multi-family and commercial real estate loans, as well any future credit deterioration, will require us to increase our allowance further in the future.\nIn addition, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency periodically reviews our allowance for loan losses and could require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur increase in multi-family and commercial real estate lending could expose us to increased lending risks and related loan losses.\nIn late 2012, we established a commercial loan department to expand our multi-family and commercial lending activities. From March 31, 2014 to March 31, 2015, our multi-family and commercial portfolio increased $27.5 million. Our current business strategy is to continue to increase our originations of multi-family and commercial real estate loans in accordance with our conservative underwriting guidelines. Multi-family and commercial real estate loans generally expose a lender to greater risk of non-payment and loss than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation of the properties and the income stream of the borrowers. Such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Further, we may increase our loans to individual borrowers, which would result in larger loan balances. In addition, to the extent that borrowers have more than one multi-family or commercial loan outstanding, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship could expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one-to four-family residential real estate loan. Furthermore, if loans that are collateralized by multi-family or commercial real estate become troubled and the value of the real estate has been significantly impaired, then we may not be able to recover the full contractual amount of principal and interest that we anticipated at the time we originated the loan, which could cause us to increase our provision for loan losses and adversely affect our earnings and financial condition.\nIt is difficult for us to assess the future performance of newly originated multi-family and commercial real estate loans because our relatively limited experience in this type of lending does not provide us with a significant payment history from which to judge future collectability, especially in a less than robust economic environment. Accordingly, these unseasoned loans may experience higher delinquency or charge-off levels than our historical loan portfolio experience, which would adversely affect our earnings.\nOur emphasis on residential mortgage loans exposes us to risks.\nAt March 31, 2015, $557.3 million, or 86.7%, of our loan portfolio was secured by one- to four-family real estate and we intend to continue this type of lending in the foreseeable future. One- to four-family residential mortgage lending is generally sensitive to regional and local economic conditions that significantly impact the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations, making loss levels difficult to predict. The decline in residential real estate values as a result of a downturn in the local housing market has reduced (and would reduce) the value of the real estate collateral securing these types of loans. Declines in real estate values could cause some of our residential mortgages to be inadequately collateralized, which would expose us to a greater risk of loss if we seek to recover on defaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral.\nOur earnings may be negatively impacted as a result of our plans to grow and diversify our loan portfolio.\nAs a result of our strategy to grow and diversify our loan portfolio by increasing our multi-family and commercial real estate lending activities, we will incur increased operating expenses associated with the hiring of additional personnel and the addition of appropriate infrastructure that will be necessary to implement this strategy. These expenses will relate to salaries and employee benefits for additional staff, increased marketing efforts, investment in technology and developing our business and deposit products to better serve commercial customers. Over time, we anticipate that we will generate additional income related to this growth and diversification strategy.\nThe building of market share through our branching strategy could cause our expenses to increase faster than revenues.\nWe intend to open a full-service branch office in Hoboken, New Jersey in fiscal 2016 and may open additional branch offices in the future. There are considerable costs involved in opening branches and new branches generally require a period of time to generate sufficient revenues to offset their costs, especially in areas in which we do not have an established presence. Accordingly, any new branch can be expected to negatively impact our earnings for some period of time until the branch reaches a certain customer base.\nWe intend to implement new equity benefit plans that will adversely affect our profitability and may dilute your ownership interest.\nIf approved by our shareholders, we intend to adopt a new equity incentive plan. We will recognize additional annual employee compensation and benefit expenses as a result of the implementation of the new equity incentive plan. These additional expenses are expected to be material and will adversely affect our profitability. We may fund the equity incentive plan through the purchase of common stock in the open market (subject to regulatory restrictions) or by issuing new shares of common stock. If we fund the awards under the equity incentive plan by issuing new shares of common stock, your ownership interest would be diluted.\nOur strategy of transitioning from higher-rate non-core deposits to lower cost core deposits may not be successful.\nCore deposits, including checking, savings and money market accounts, are a lower cost source of funds than time deposits, and we have made a concerted effort to increase lower cost transaction and savings deposit accounts and reduce our dependence on traditionally higher cost certificates of deposit. Our current strategy is to competitively price our core deposits in order to increase core deposit relationships. In addition, we will introduce new products or offer promotional deposit rates on certain deposit products in order to attract deposits. Accordingly, during the year ended March 31, 2013, we began pricing deposits to allow for a controlled outflow of higher-rate non-core deposits in order to maintain the net interest margin and spread in the current economic environment. As a result of the strategy implemented in 2013, deposits decreased $126.8 million, or 15.3%, to $699.5 million at March 31, 2015 from $826.3 million at March 31, 2012. In addition, our ratio of certificates of deposit to total deposits has decreased from 77.2% at March 31, 2012 to 70.6% at March 31, 2015. Certificates of deposit due within one year of March 31, 2015 totaled $244.6 million, or 35.0% of total deposits. If these deposits do not remain with us, and we are not successful in attracting lower cost core deposits, we will be required to seek other sources of funds, including other certificates of deposit, Federal Home Loan Bank advances and lines of credit. Depending on market conditions, we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on maturing certificates of deposit due on or before March 31, 2016.\nWe are dependent on our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party service providers; systems failures, interruptions and security breaches could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur business is dependent on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party service providers. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If significant, sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, and/or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur third-party service providers may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes and other security breaches. We likely will expend additional resources to protect against the threat of such security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by such security breaches or viruses. To the extent that the activities of our third-party service providers or the activities of our customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches and viruses could expose us to claims, regulatory scrutiny, litigation and other possible liabilities.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners; and personally identifiable\ninformation of our customers and employees. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. We, our customers, and other financial institutions with which we interact, are subject to ongoing, continuous attempts to penetrate key systems by individual hackers, organized criminals, and in some cases, state-sponsored organizations. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such unauthorized access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties; disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers; damage our reputation; and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, all of which could adversely affect our business, revenues and competitive position. We expect to expend resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses.\nTo remain competitive, we must keep pace with technological change.\nFinancial products and services have become increasingly technology-driven. Our ability to meet the needs of our customers competitively, and in a cost-efficient manner, is dependent on the ability to keep pace with technological advances and to invest in new technology as it becomes available. Many of our competitors have already implemented critical technologies have greater resources to invest in technology than we do and may be better equipped to market new technology-driven products and services. The ability to keep pace with technological change is important, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse impact on our business and therefore on our financial condition and results of operations.\nImprovements in technology will increase our costs and may impact our growth strategies.\nIn order to improve our technology and competitiveness, we changed our core service/data services provider during fiscal 2015. This resulted in additional data related costs. Going forward, we plan to continue to update to new technologies to enhance the customer experience and ultimately increase the efficiency of our operations. We believe such technological changes are necessary to be able to effectively compete in our marketplace. Such changes will increase expenses. In addition, we may experience delays in acquisition and implementation of new technologies which could further increase costs and adversely impact our growth strategies.\nThe amount of dividends we pay on our common stock, if any, may be limited by certain factors including the ability of Clifton Savings Bank to pay dividends to Clifton Bancorp Inc.\nThe long-term ability of Clifton Bancorp to pay dividends to its stockholders is based primarily upon the ability of Clifton Savings Bank to make capital distributions to Clifton Bancorp, and also on the availability of cash at the holding company level in the event earnings are not sufficient to pay dividends. Under Office of the Comptroller of the Currency safe harbor regulations, Clifton Savings Bank may distribute to Clifton Bancorp capital not exceeding net income for the current calendar year and the prior two calendar years. In addition, Clifton Bancorp\u2019s dividend rate and the continued payment of dividends will depend upon a number of other factors, including tax considerations, capital requirements and alternative uses for capital, industry standards and economic conditions. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to pay dividends or that we will not reduce dividends in the future.\nOur plans to return excess capital to stockholders are limited by extensive government regulation.\nGovernment regulations and regulatory policies may affect our ability to pay dividends, repurchase shares of common stock or otherwise engage in capital distributions. We intend to manage our capital position, using appropriate capital management tools, to return excess capital to our stockholders. In particular, we recently approved a new stock repurchase program that became effective on April 2, 2015 and we expect to continue stock repurchases subject to market conditions and regulatory restrictions. Current Federal Reserve Board policy generally limits our ability to repurchase stock in certain circumstances and limits our ability to pay dividends and provides for prior regulatory review of capital distributions in certain circumstances.\nA return of recessionary conditions could result in increases in our level of non-performing loans and/or reduce demand for our products and services, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nAlthough the U.S. economy has emerged from the severe recession that occurred in 2008 and 2009, economic growth has been slow and uneven, and unemployment levels remain relatively high. Recovery by many businesses has been impaired by lower consumer spending. A return to prolonged deteriorating economic conditions could significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the value of our loans and investments, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability. Further, declines in real estate values and sales volumes and elevated unemployment levels may result in higher than expected loan delinquencies, increases in our non-performing and classified assets and a decline in demand for our products and services. These events may cause us to incur losses and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our non-performing assets and troubled debt restructurings increased from $265,000 at March 31, 2008 to $6.4 million at March 31, 2015. Reduction in problem assets has been slow, and the process has been exacerbated by the condition of some of the properties securing non-performing loans, the lengthy foreclosure process in New Jersey and extended workout plans with certain borrowers. To the extent that we must work through the resolution of assets, economic problems may cause us to incur losses and adversely affect our capital, liquidity, and financial condition.\nThe geographic concentration of our loan portfolio and lending activities makes us vulnerable to a downturn in the local economy.\nWhile there is not a single employer or industry in our market area on which a significant number of our customers are dependent, a substantial portion of our loan portfolio is comprised of loans secured by property located in northern New Jersey. This makes us vulnerable to a downturn in the local economy and real estate markets. Adverse conditions in the local economy such as unemployment, recession, a catastrophic event or other factors beyond our control could impact the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, which could impact our net interest income. Decreases in local real estate values caused by economic conditions or other events could adversely affect the value of the property used as collateral for our loans, which could cause us to realize a loss in the event of a foreclosure.\nStrong competition within our market area could hurt our profits and slow growth.\nOur profitability depends upon our continued ability to compete successfully in our market area. We face intense competition both in making loans and attracting deposits. We continue to face stiff competition for one- to four-family residential loans from other financial service providers, including large national residential lenders and local community banks. Other competitors for one- to four-family residential loans include credit unions and mortgage brokers which keep overhead costs and mortgage rates down by selling loans and not holding or servicing them. Our competitors for multi-family and commercial real estate loans include other community bank commercial lenders, many of which are larger than us and have greater resources and lending limits than we have and offer services that we do not provide. Price competition for loans and deposits might result in us earning less on our loans and paying more on our deposits, which reduces net interest income. We expect competition to remain strong in the future even though there are increased legislative, regulatory and technological changes and a continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry.\nRegulation of the financial services industry is undergoing major changes, and we may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation, supervision and examination. Such regulation, supervision and examination governs the activities in which we may engage, and is intended primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance fund and Clifton Savings Bank\u2019s depositors.\nIn 2010 and 2011, in response to the financial crisis and recession that began in 2008, significant regulatory and legislative changes resulted in broad reform and increased regulation affecting financial institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act has created a significant shift in the way financial institutions operate and has restructured the regulation of depository institutions by merging the Office of Thrift Supervision, which previously regulated Clifton Savings\nBank, into the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and assigning the regulation of savings and loan holding companies to the Federal Reserve Board. The Dodd-Frank Act also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to administer consumer protection and fair lending laws, a function that was formerly performed by the depository institution regulators. As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the federal banking regulators have implemented new consolidated capital requirements that will limit our ability to borrow at the holding company level and invest the proceeds from such borrowings as capital in Clifton Savings Bank that could be leveraged to support additional growth. The Dodd-Frank Act contains various other provisions designed to enhance the regulation of depository institutions and prevent the recurrence of a financial crisis such as that which occurred in 2008 and 2009. The Dodd-Frank Act has had and may continue to have a material impact on our operations, particularly through increased regulatory burden and compliance costs. Any future legislative changes could have a material impact on our profitability, the value of assets held for investment or the value of collateral for loans. Future legislative changes could also require changes to business practices and potentially expose us to additional costs, liabilities, enforcement action and reputational risk.\nFederal regulatory agencies have the ability to take strong supervisory actions against financial institutions that have experienced increased loan losses and other weaknesses. These actions include the entering into of written agreements and cease and desist orders that place certain limitations on their operations. If we were to become subject to a supervisory agreement such action may negatively impact our ability to execute our business plan, and result in operational restrictions, as well as our ability to grow, pay dividends, repurchase stock or engage in mergers and acquisitions. See \u201cRegulation and Supervision-Federal Banking Regulation-Capital Requirements\u201d for a discussion of regulatory capital requirements.\nNew regulations could restrict our ability to originate loans.\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has issued a rule designed to clarify for lenders how they can avoid monetary damages under the Dodd-Frank Act, which would hold lenders accountable for ensuring a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a mortgage. Loans that meet this \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d definition will be presumed to have complied with the new ability-to-repay standard. Under the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s rule, a \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d loan must not contain certain specified features, including (i) excessive upfront points and fees (those exceeding 3% of the total loan amount, less \u201cbona fide discount points\u201d for prime loans); (ii) interest-only-payments; (iii) negative amortization; or (iv) terms longer than 30 years. Additionally, to qualify as a \u201cqualified mortgage,\u201d a borrower\u2019s total debt-to-income ratio may not exceed 43%. Lenders must also verify and document the income and financial resources relied upon to qualify the borrower for the loan and underwrite the loan based on a fully amortizing payment schedule and maximum interest rate during the first five years, taking into account all applicable taxes, insurance and assessments. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s rule on qualified mortgages could limit our ability or desire to make certain types of loans or loans or pursue certain borrowers, or could make it more expensive/and or time consuming to make these loans, which could limit our growth or profitability.\nWe may have unanticipated credit risk in our investment and mortgage-backed securities portfolio.\nAt March 31, 2015, $418.9 million, or 35.3%, of our assets consisted of investment and mortgage-backed securities, $295.6 million of which (representing 24.9% of our assets at March 31, 2015) were issued by, or have principal and interest payments guaranteed by, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. On September 7, 2008, the Federal Housing Finance Agency placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into federal conservatorship. Although the federal government has committed substantial capital to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, these credit facilities and other capital infusions may not be adequate for their needs. If the financial support is inadequate, or if additional support is not provided when needed, these companies could fail to honor their guarantees and other obligations. As a result, the future roles of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could be significantly altered. Failure by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac to honor their guarantees or obligations, or a significant restructuring of their roles, could have a significant adverse effect on the market value and cash flows of the investment and mortgage-backed securities we hold, which could result in substantial losses.", "PERMNO": 90080, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "CSBK"}
