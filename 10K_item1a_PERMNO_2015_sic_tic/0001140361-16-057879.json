{"cik": "876343", "company": "BIOTIME INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to various risks, including those described below. You should consider the following risk factors, together with all of the other information included in this report, which could materially adversely affect our proposed operations, our business prospects, and financial condition, and the value of an investment in our business. There may be other factors that are not mentioned here or of which we are not presently aware that could also affect our business operations and prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations\nWe have incurred operating losses since inception and we do not know if we will attain profitability\nOur total comprehensive losses for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 were $47.8 million, $36.4 million, and $43.8 million respectively, and we had an accumulated deficit of $229.2 million, $182.2 million, and $145.8 million, as of December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. We primarily finance our operations through the sale of equity securities, licensing fees, royalties on product sales by our licensees, research grants, and subscription fees and advertising revenue from database products. Ultimately, our ability to generate sufficient operating revenue to earn a profit depends upon our success in developing and marketing or licensing our products, diagnostic tests, and technology.\nWe will spend a substantial amount of our capital on research and development but we might not succeed in developing products and technologies that are useful in medicine\n\u00b7 We are attempting to develop new medical products and technologies.\n\u00b7 Many of our experimental products and technologies have not been applied in human medicine and have only been used in laboratory studies in vitro or in animals. These new products and technologies might not prove to be safe and efficacious in the human medical applications for which they were developed.\nTable of Content\n\u00b7 The experimentation we are doing is costly, time consuming, and uncertain as to its results. We incurred research and development expenses amounting to $42.6 million, $37.5 million, and $26.6 million during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, excluding $17.5 million charged as in process research and development expenses during 2013 in accordance with ASC 805-50 on account of Asterias\u2019 acquisition of certain assets from Geron.\n\u00b7 If we are successful in developing a new technology or product, refinement of the new technology or product and definition of the practical applications and limitations of the technology or product may take years and require the expenditure of large sums of money. Future clinical trials of new therapeutic products, particularly those products that are regulated as drugs or biological, will be very expensive and will take years to complete. We may not have the financial resources to fund clinical trials on our own and we may have to enter into licensing or collaborative arrangements with larger, well-capitalized pharmaceutical companies in order to bear the cost. Any such arrangements may be dilutive to our ownership or economic interest in the products we develop, and we might have to accept a royalty payment on the sale of the product rather than receiving the gross revenues from product sales.\nThe operations of Asterias and OncoCyte will result in an increase in our operating expenses and losses on a consolidated basis\n\u00b7 The expansion of the operations of our subsidiaries Asterias and OncoCyte will involve substantial expense, including but not limited to hiring additional research and management personnel, and, in the case of OncoCyte, marketing personnel if it successfully completes the development of its initial cancer diagnostic tests, and those expenses will add to our losses on a consolidated basis for the near future.\n\u00b7 Asterias and OncoCyte are a public companies and will incur costs associated with audits of their respective financial statements, filing annual, quarterly, and other periodic reports with the SEC, holding annual shareholder meetings, listing their common stock for trading, and public relations and investor relations. These costs will be in addition to those incurred by BioTime for similar purposes.\n\u00b7 As a developer of therapeutic products derived from pluripotent stem, Asterias will face substantially the same kind of risks that affect our business, as well as the risks related to our industry generally.\nPatents pertaining to the manufacture of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) products from pluripotent cells recently issued to one of our competitors and could impact the rights of Cell Cure Neurosciences to manufacture and commercialize OpRegen\u00ae\nThe USPTO issued certain RPE-related patents to Ocata in 2015, with claims directed to methods of producing RPE cell compositions for human therapy. If the process used by Cell Cure Neurosciences to manufacture RPE cells for OpRegen\u00ae were to be determined to infringe the issued claims and if the patented claims were to be determined to be valid, Cell Cure Neurosciences might not be permitted to manufacture OpRegen\u00ae and commercialize that product in the United States or in other countries in which such patent claims may have issued.\nOur success depends in part on the uncertain growth of the stem cell industry, which is still in its infancy\n\u00b7 The success of Ascendance\u2019s business of selling products for use in stem cell research depends on the growth of stem cell research, without which there may be no market or only a very small market for our products and technology. The likelihood that stem cell research will grow depends upon the successful development of stem cell products that can be used to treat disease or injuries in people or that can be used to facilitate the development of other therapeutic products.\n\u00b7 The growth in stem cell research also depends upon the availability of funding through private investment and government research grants. In the event of a failed trial of a proposed stem cell product by us or by another company, for reasons of efficacy or safety, it could be increasingly difficult to secure funding or have future INDs cleared by the FDA.\nTable of Content\n\u00b7 There can be no assurance that any safe and efficacious human medical applications will be developed using stem cells or related technology.\n\u00b7 If serious adverse events related to cell therapy products were to arise in clinical trials or after marketing approval, the FDA or foreign regulators could impose more restrictive safety requirements on cell therapy products generally, including in the manner of use and manufacture, could require safety warnings in product labeling, and could limit, restrict or deny permission for new cell therapy products to enter clinical trials or to be marketed.\nWe are providing funding for the development of new software products\nOur subsidiary LifeMap Sciences has formed a new subsidiary, LifeMap Solutions, Inc., to develop new personal mobile health software products intended to connect users with their complex personal health information and other big data. The field of mobile health products, including both hardware and software products, is new, and there is no certainty that LifeMap Solutions will be successful in developing its planned new products or that it will be successful in commercializing any products that it does develop.\nLifeMap Solutions has not yet launched any commercial products, and we would need to continue to provide funding for the development and commercialization of the planned products, unless it is able to obtain financing from other sources. The field of mobile health products is subject to increasing competition, including from large computer and internet technology companies that have much greater financial and marketing resources than we and LifeMap Solutions have.\nThe FDA has also taken an interest in the field of on-line or mobile health products and there is a risk that the FDA could determine that LifeMap Solutions\u2019 products should be regulated as medical devices under existing laws and regulations, or the FDA could promulgate new regulations that might subject LifeMap Solutions\u2019 products to FDA clinical trial and approval procedures, as a prerequisite for permission to use and market the new mobile health products in the United States. Foreign regulatory authorities could make similar determinations or could adopt their own rules regulating the use and marketing of LifeMap Solution\u2019s products.\nSales of our products to date have not been sufficient to generate an amount of revenue sufficient to cover our operating expenses\nThe revenues that we have received from sales of products have not been sufficient to pay our operating expenses. This means that we and our subsidiaries need to successfully develop and market or license additional products and earn additional revenues in sufficient amounts to meet our operating expenses.\nSales of the products we may develop will be adversely impacted by the availability of competing products\n\u00b7 Sales of Hextend\u00ae have already been adversely impacted by the availability of other products that are commonly used in surgery and trauma care and sell at low prices.\n\u00b7 Ocata, which was recently acquired by a subsidiary of Astellas Pharma, Inc. for $379 million, is conducting clinical trials of a pluripotent stem cell product designed to treat AMD. If the Ocata product is proven to be safe and effective, it may reach the market ahead of OpRegen\u00ae. Moreover, Ocata was recently issued a patent pertaining to the manufacture of RPE products that could adversely impact the rights of Cell Cure Neurosciences to manufacture OpRegen\u00ae.\n\u00b7 In order to compete with other products, particularly those that sell at lower prices, our products will have to provide medically significant advantages.\n\u00b7 Physicians and hospitals may be reluctant to try a new product due to the high degree of risk associated with the application of new technologies and products in the field of human medicine.\nTable of Content\n\u00b7 Competing products are being manufactured and marketed by established pharmaceutical companies. For example, B. Braun presently markets Hespan\u00ae, an artificial plasma volume expander, and Hospira, Inc. and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc. sell a generic equivalent of Hespan\u00ae. Hospira also markets Voluven\u00ae, a plasma volume expander containing a 6% low molecular weight hydroxyethyl starch in saline solution.\n\u00b7 Competing products for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer are being manufactured and marketed by established pharmaceutical companies, and more cancer diagnostics and therapeutics are being developed by those companies and by other smaller biotechnology companies. Other companies, both large and small, are also working on the development of stem cell based therapies for the same diseases and disorders that are the focus of the research and development programs of our subsidiaries.\n\u00b7 There also is a risk that our competitors may succeed at developing safer or more effective products that could render our products and technologies obsolete or noncompetitive.\nSales of Hextend\u00ae have been adversely affected by safety and use labeling changes required by the FDA\nSales of Hextend\u00ae have been adversely affected by certain safety labeling changes required by the FDA for the entire class of hydroxyethyl starch products, including Hextend\u00ae. The labeling changes were approved by the FDA in November 2013 and include a boxed warning stating that the use of hydroxyethyl starch products, including Hextend\u00ae, increases the risk of mortality and renal injury requiring renal replacement therapy in critically ill adult patients, including patients with sepsis, and that Hextend\u00ae should not be used in critically ill adult patients, including patients with sepsis. New warning and precaution information is also required along with new information about contraindications, adverse reactions, and information about certain recent studies. The new warning and precautions include statements to the effect that the use of Hextend\u00ae should be avoided in patients with pre-existing renal dysfunction, and the coagulation status of patients undergoing open heart surgery in association with cardiopulmonary bypass should be monitored as excess bleeding has been reported with hydroxyethyl starch solutions in that population and use of Hextend\u00ae should be discontinued at the first sign of coagulopathy. The liver function of patients receiving hydroxyethyl starch products, including Hextend\u00ae should also be monitored. The approved revised label may adversely affect Hextend\u00ae sales since some users of plasma volume expanders might elect to abandon the use of all hydroxyethyl starch products, including Hextend\u00ae.\nWe will need to issue additional equity or debt securities in order to raise additional capital needed to pay our operating expenses\n\u00b7 We plan to continue to incur substantial research and product development expenses, largely through our subsidiaries, and we and our subsidiaries will need to raise additional capital to pay operating expenses until we are able to generate sufficient revenues from product sales, royalties, and license fees.\n\u00b7 It is likely that additional sales of equity or debt securities will be required to meet our short-term capital needs, unless we receive substantial revenues from the sale of our new products or we are successful at licensing or sublicensing the technology that we develop or acquire from others and we receive substantial licensing fees and royalties.\n\u00b7 Our ability, and the ability of our subsidiaries, to raise additional equity or debt capital will depend not only on progress made in developing new products and technologies, but also will depend on access to capital and conditions in the capital markets. There is no assurance that we and our subsidiaries, even those that have shares listed on the NYSE MKT, will be able to raise capital at times and in amounts needed to finance product development, clinical trials, and general operations. Even if capital is available, it may not be available on terms that we or our shareholders would consider favorable.\n\u00b7 Sales of additional equity securities by us or our subsidiaries could result in the dilution of the interests of present shareholders.\nTable of Content\nThe amount and pace of research and development work that we and our subsidiaries can do or sponsor, and our ability to commence and complete clinical trials required to obtain regulatory approval to market our therapeutic and medical device products, depends upon the amount of money we have\n\u00b7 At December 31, 2015, we had $42.2 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, of which $22.1 million was held by our subsidiaries. There can be no assurance that we or our subsidiaries will be able to raise additional funds on favorable terms or at all, or that any funds raised will be sufficient to permit us or our subsidiaries to develop and market our products and technology. Unless we and our subsidiaries are able to generate sufficient revenue or raise additional funds when needed, it is likely that we will be unable to continue our planned activities, even if we make progress in our research and development projects.\n\u00b7 We may have to postpone or limit the pace of our research and development work and planned clinical trials of our product candidates unless our cash resources increase through a growth in revenues or additional equity investment or borrowing.\nAny cell-based products that receive regulatory approval may be difficult and expensive to manufacture on a commercial scale\n\u00b7 pluripotent stem derived therapeutic cells have only been produced on a small scale and not in quantities and at levels of purity and viability that will be needed for wide scale commercialization. If we are successful in developing products that consist of pluripotent stem cells or other cells or products derived from pluripotent stem or other cells, we will need to develop, alone or in collaboration with one or more pharmaceutical companies or contract manufacturers, technology for the commercial production of those products.\n\u00b7 pluripotent stem cell or other cell based products are likely to be more expensive to manufacture on a commercial scale than most other drugs on the market today. The high cost of manufacturing a product will require that we charge our customers a high price for the product in order to cover our costs and earn a profit. If the price of our products is too high, hospitals and physicians may be reluctant to purchase our products, especially if lower priced alternative products are available, and we may not be able to sell our products in sufficient volumes to recover our costs of development and manufacture or to earn a profit.\nWe and our subsidiaries will have certain obligations and may incur liabilities arising from clinical trials, and we do not yet know the scope of any resulting expenses that might arise\nWe or our subsidiaries that conduct clinical trials of product candidates face the risk of incurring liabilities to patients if they incur any injuries as a result of their participation in the clinical trials. We or our subsidiaries will also be obligated to obtain information and prepare reports about the health of the clinical trial patients. In addition, Asterias has assumed Geron\u2019s obligations to obtain information and prepare reports about the health of patients, and has assumed any liabilities to those patients that might arise from any injuries they may have incurred, as a result of their participation in the clinical trials of Geron\u2019s GRN-OPC1 cell replacement therapy for spinal cord damage and its GRN-VAC1 immunological therapy for certain cancers. We are not aware of any claims by patients alleging injuries suffered as a result of any of our clinical trials or the Geron clinical trials, but if any claims are made and if liability can be established, the amount of any liability that we or our subsidiaries may incur, depending upon the nature and extent of any provable injuries, could exceed any insurance coverage that we or our subsidiaries may obtain, and the amount of the liability could be material to our financial condition.\nOur business could be adversely affected if we lose the services of the key personnel upon whom we depend\nBioTime stem cell research programs, and to a lesser extent, the programs of BioTime\u2019s subsidiaries, are directed primarily by our Co-Chief Executive Officers, Dr. Michael West and Adi Mohanty. BioTime\u2019s subsidiaries are directed by their respective management teams. The loss of the services of Dr. West, Mr. Mohanty or other members of senior management of BioTime or of our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on us.\nTable of Content\nIf we make strategic acquisitions, we will incur a variety of costs and might never realize the anticipated benefits\nIf appropriate opportunities become available, we might attempt to acquire approved products, additional drug candidates, diagnostic tests, technologies, or businesses that we believe are a strategic fit with our business. If we pursue any transaction of that sort, the process of negotiating the acquisition and integrating an acquired product, drug candidate, diagnostic test, technology, or business might result in operating difficulties and expenditures and might require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business, whether or not any such transaction is ever consummated. Moreover, we might never realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition. Future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, or impairment expenses related to goodwill, and impairment or amortization expenses related to other intangible assets, which could harm our financial condition.\nFailure of our internal control over financial reporting could harm our business and financial results\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of the financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of our assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected. Our growth and entry into new products, technologies and markets will place significant additional pressure on our system of internal control over financial reporting. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud.\nOperating our business through subsidiaries, some of which are located in foreign countries, also adds to the complexity of our internal control over financial reporting and adds to the risk of a system failure, an undetected improper use or expenditure of funds or other resources by a subsidiary, or a failure to properly report a transaction or financial results of a subsidiary. We allocate certain expenses among BioTime itself and one or more of our subsidiaries, which creates a risk that the allocations we make may not accurately reflect the benefit of an expenditure or use of financial or other resources by BioTime as the parent company and the subsidiaries among which the allocations are made. An inaccurate allocation may impact our consolidated financial results, particularly in the case of subsidiaries that we do not wholly own since our financial statements include adjustments to reflect the minority ownership interests in our subsidiaries held by others.\nOur multi-subsidiary corporate structure may give rise to administrative inefficiencies and may add to our administrative expenses.\nThe operation of our business through multiple subsidiaries, two of which are public companies, will result in certain administrative expense that we would not incur if all of our operations were conducted within BioTime itself. Our subsidiaries generally provide compensation to their own executive management teams and members of their boards of directors who are not employees of BioTime or a BioTime subsidiary. Other expenses arise from more complex record keeping and internal procedures for allocating various operating expenses, such as rent, equipment, utilities, and shared personnel, among BioTime and the subsidiaries, and from the obligations of Asterias and OncoCyte to prepare and file their own periodic financial and informational reports and proxy materials with the SEC and to hold annual meetings of their shareholders.\nTable of Content\nWe may also face conflicts of interest in managing, financing, engaging in transactions with, or allocating business opportunities to, subsidiaries that are not wholly-owned by us. Our directors and those of our subsidiaries will consider their fiduciary duties to BioTime and the subsidiaries, and in certain circumstances decisions making may be delegated to committees of directors who are \u201cindependent\u201d under the rules of the NYSE MKT. We or our subsidiaries also may engage the services of independent financial advisers to provide valuations and other advice with respect to certain proposed transactions.\nOur business and operations could suffer in the event of computer system failures\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. Such events could cause interruption of our operations. For example, the loss of data for our product candidates could result in delays in our regulatory filings and development efforts and significantly increase our costs. To the extent that any disruption or security breach was to result in a loss of or damage to our data, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the development of our product candidates could be delayed.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nWe will face certain risks arising from regulatory, legal, and economic factors that affect our business and the business of other biotechnology and pharmaceutical development companies. Because we are a small company with limited revenues and limited capital resources, we may be less able to bear the financial impact of these risks than is the case with larger companies possessing substantial income and available capital.\nIf we do not receive regulatory approvals we will not be permitted to sell our therapeutic and medical device products\nThe therapeutic and medical device products that we and our subsidiaries develop cannot be sold until the FDA and corresponding foreign regulatory authorities approve the products for medical use. The need to obtain regulatory approval to market a new product means that:\n\u00b7 We will have to conduct expensive and time-consuming clinical trials of new products. The full cost of conducting and completing clinical trials necessary to obtain FDA and foreign regulatory approval of a new product cannot be presently determined, but could exceed our current financial resources.\n\u00b7 Clinical trials and the regulatory approval process for a pharmaceutical or cell-based product can take several years to complete. As a result, we will incur the expense and delay inherent in seeking FDA and foreign regulatory approval of new products, even if the results of clinical trials are favorable.\n\u00b7 Data obtained from preclinical and clinical studies is susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit, or prevent regulatory agency approvals. Delays in the regulatory approval process or rejections of an application for approval of a new product may be encountered as a result of changes in regulatory agency policy.\n\u00b7 Because the therapeutic products we are developing with pluripotent stem cell technology involve the application of new technologies and approaches to medicine, the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies may subject those products to additional or more stringent review than drugs or biologicals derived from other technologies.\n\u00b7 A product that is approved may be subject to restrictions on use.\n\u00b7 The FDA can recall or withdraw approval of a product if problems arise.\n\u00b7 We will face similar regulatory issues in foreign countries.\nTable of Content\nClinical trial failures can occur at any stage of the testing and we may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, the clinical trial process that could delay or prevent commercialization of our current or future product candidates\nClinical trial failures or delays can occur at any stage of the trials, and may be directly or indirectly caused by a variety of factors, including but not limited to:\n\u00b7 delays in securing clinical investigators or trial sites for our clinical trials;\n\u00b7 delays in obtaining institutional review board (IRB) and other regulatory approvals to commence a clinical trial;\n\u00b7 slower than anticipated rates of patient recruitment and enrollment, or failing to reach the targeted number of patients due to competition for patients from other trials;\n\u00b7 limited or no availability of coverage, reimbursement and adequate payment from health maintenance organizations and other third party payors for the use of agents used in our clinical trials;\n\u00b7 negative or inconclusive results from clinical trials;\n\u00b7 unforeseen side effects interrupting, delaying or halting clinical trials of our product candidates and possibly resulting in the FDA or other regulatory authorities denying approval of our product candidates;\n\u00b7 unforeseen safety issues;\n\u00b7 uncertain dosing issues;\n\u00b7 approval and introduction of new therapies or changes in standards of practice or regulatory guidance that render our clinical trial endpoints or the targeting of our proposed indications obsolete;\n\u00b7 inability to monitor patients adequately during or after treatment or problems with investigator or patient compliance with the trial protocols;\n\u00b7 inability to replicate in large controlled studies safety and efficacy data obtained from a limited number of patients in uncontrolled trials;\n\u00b7 inability or unwillingness of medical investigators to follow our clinical protocols; and\n\u00b7 unavailability of clinical trial supplies.\nGovernment-imposed bans or restrictions and religious, moral, and ethical concerns about the use of hES cells could prevent us from developing and successfully marketing stem cell products\nGovernment-imposed bans or restrictions on the use of embryos or hES cells in research and development in the United States and abroad could generally constrain stem cell research, thereby limiting the market and demand for our products. During March 2009, President Obama lifted certain restrictions on federal funding of research involving the use of hES cells, and in accordance with President Obama\u2019s Executive Order, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has adopted new guidelines for determining the eligibility of hES cell lines for use in federally funded research. The central focus of the proposed guidelines is to assure that hES cells used in federally funded research were derived from human embryos that were created for reproductive purposes, were no longer needed for this purpose, and were voluntarily donated for research purposes with the informed written consent of the donors. The hES cells that were derived from embryos created for research purposes rather than reproductive purposes, and other hES cells that were not derived in compliance with the guidelines, are not eligible for use in federally funded research.\nTable of Content\nCalifornia law requires that stem cell research be conducted under the oversight of a stem cell review oversight committee (SCRO). Many kinds of stem cell research, including the derivation of new hES cell lines, may only be conducted in California with the prior written approval of the SCRO. A SCRO could prohibit or impose restrictions on the research that we plan to do.\nThe use of hES cells gives rise to religious, moral, and ethical issues regarding the appropriate means of obtaining the cells and the appropriate use and disposal of the cells. These considerations could lead to more restrictive government regulations or could generally constrain stem cell research, thereby limiting the market and demand for our products.\nIf we are unable to obtain and enforce patents and to protect our trade secrets, others could use our technology to compete with us, which could limit opportunities for us to generate revenues by licensing our technology and selling products\n\u00b7 Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and enforce patents and maintain trade secrets in the United States and in other countries. If we are unsuccessful at obtaining and enforcing patents, our competitors could use our technology and create products that compete with our products, without paying license fees or royalties to us.\n\u00b7 The preparation, filing, and prosecution of patent applications can be costly and time consuming. Our limited financial resources may not permit us to pursue patent protection of all of our technology and products throughout the world.\n\u00b7 Even if we are able to obtain issued patents covering our technology or products, we may have to incur substantial legal fees and other expenses to enforce our patent rights in order to protect our technology and products from infringing uses. We may not have the financial resources to finance the litigation required to preserve our patent and trade secret rights.\n\u00b7 In addition to interference proceedings, the USPTO can re-examine issued patents at the request of a third party seeking to have the patent invalidated. This means that patents owned or licensed by us may be subject to re-examination and may be lost if the outcome of the re-examination is unfavorable to us. Our patents may be subject to inter partes review (replacing the prior inter partes reexamination proceeding), a proceeding in which a third party can challenge the validity of one of our patents.\nThere is no certainty that our pending or future patent applications will result in the issuance of patents\nWe have filed patent applications for technology that we have developed, and we have obtained licenses for a number of patent applications covering technology developed by others, that we believe will be useful in producing new products, and which we believe may be of commercial interest to other companies that may be willing to sublicense the technology for fees or royalty payments. In the future, we may also file additional new patent applications seeking patent protection for new technology or products that we develop ourselves or jointly with others. However, there is no assurance that any of our licensed patent applications, or any patent applications that we have filed or that we may file in the future covering our own technology, either in the United States or abroad, will result in the issuance of patents.\nIn Europe, there is uncertainty about the eligibility of hES cell subject matter for patent protection. The European Patent Convention prohibits the granting of European patents for inventions that concern \u201cuses of human embryos for industrial or commercial purposes.\u201d A recent decision at the Court of Justice of the European Union interpreted parthenogeneticly produced hES cells as patentable subject matter. Consequently, the European Patent Office now recognizes that human pluripotent stem cells (including human ES cells) can be created without a destructive use of human embryos as of June 5, 2003, and patent applications relating to hES cell subject matter with a filing and priority date after this date are no longer automatically excluded from patentability under Article 53 (a) EPC and Rule 28(c) EPC.\nTable of Content\nThe Supreme Court decisions in Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc. and Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics will need to be considered in determining whether certain diagnostic methods and reagents can be patented, since the Court denied patent protection for the use of a mathematical correlation of the presence of a well-known naturally occurring metabolite as a means of determining proper drug dosage, and found that DNA sequences isolated from humans were not patent eligible. Our subsidiary OncoCyte is developing cancer diagnostic tests based on the presence of certain genetic markers and proteins for a variety of cancers. Because OncoCyte\u2019s planned diagnostic tests combine an innovative methodology with newly discovered compositions of matter, we are hopeful that the Supreme Court decision will not preclude the availability of patent protection for the diagnostic tests that OncoCyte is developing. However, like other developers of diagnostic products, OncoCyte is evaluating the Supreme Court decision and interim guidelines issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for the patenting of products that test for biological substances.\nThe process of applying for and obtaining patents can be expensive and slow\n\u00b7 The preparation and filing of patent applications, and the maintenance of patents that are issued, may require substantial time and money.\n\u00b7 A patent interference proceeding may be instituted with the USPTO for patents or applications filed before March 16, 2013 when more than one person files a patent application covering the same technology, or if someone wishes to challenge the validity of an issued patent. At the completion of the interference proceeding, the USPTO may determine which competing applicant is entitled to the patent, or whether an issued patent is valid. Patent interference proceedings are complex, highly contested legal proceedings, and the USPTO\u2019s decision is subject to appeal. This means that if an interference proceeding arises with respect to any of our patent applications, we may experience significant expenses and delay in obtaining a patent, and if the outcome of the proceeding is unfavorable to us, the patent could be issued to a competitor rather than to us.\n\u00b7 A derivation proceeding may be instituted by the USPTO or an inventor alleging that a patent or application was derived from the work of another inventor.\n\u00b7 Post Grant Review under the new America Invents Act makes available opposition-like proceedings in the United States. As with the USPTO interference proceedings, Post Grant Review proceedings will be very expensive to contest and can result in cancellation of a patent.\n\u00b7 Oppositions to the issuance of patents may be filed under European patent law and the patent laws of certain other countries. As with the USPTO interference proceedings, these foreign proceedings can be very expensive to contest and can result in significant delays in obtaining a patent or can result in a denial of a patent application\nWe may be subject to patent infringement claims that could be costly to defend, which may limit our ability to use disputed technologies, and which could prevent us from pursuing research and development or commercialization of some of our products, require us to pay licensing fees to have freedom to operate, and/or result in monetary damages or other liability for us\nThe success of our business depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing patents and other proprietary rights of others. If the technology that we use infringes a patent held by others, we could be sued for monetary damages by the patent holder or its licensee, or we could be prevented from continuing research, development, and commercialization of products that rely on that technology, unless we are able to obtain a license to use the patent. The cost and availability of a license to a patent cannot be predicted, and the likelihood of obtaining a license at an acceptable cost would be lower if the patent holder or any of its licensees is using the patent to develop or market a product with which our product would compete. If we could not obtain a necessary license, we would need to develop or obtain rights to alternative technologies, which could prove costly and could cause delays in product development, or we could be forced to discontinue the development or marketing of any products that were developed using the technology covered by the patent.\nTable of Content\nIf we fail to meet our obligations under license agreements, we may lose our rights to key technologies on which our business depends\nOur business depends on several critical technologies that are based in part on technology licensed from third parties. Those third-party license agreements impose obligations on us, including payment obligations and obligations to pursue development of commercial products under the licensed patents or technology. If a licensor believes that we have failed to meet our obligations under a license agreement, the licensor could seek to limit or terminate our license rights, which could lead to costly and time-consuming litigation and, potentially, a loss of the licensed rights. During the period of any such litigation, our ability to carry out the development and commercialization of potential products, and our ability to raise any capital that we might then need, could be significantly and negatively affected. If our license rights were restricted or ultimately lost, we would not be able to continue to use the licensed technology in our business.\nThe price and sale of our products and diagnostic tests may be limited by health insurance coverage and government regulation\nSuccess in selling our pharmaceutical and cell-based products, medical devices, and diagnostic tests may depend in part on the extent to which health insurance companies, HMOs, and government health administration authorities such as Medicare and Medicaid will pay for the cost of the products, tests, and related treatment. Presently, most health insurance plans and HMOs will pay for Hextend\u00ae when it is used in a surgical procedure that is covered by the plan. However, until we actually introduce a new product or diagnostic test into the medical marketplace, we will not know with certainty whether adequate health insurance, HMO, and government coverage will be available to permit the product or test to be sold at a price high enough for us to generate a profit. In some foreign countries, pricing or profitability of health care products is subject to government control, which may result in low prices for our products. In the United States, there have been a number of federal and state proposals to implement similar government controls, and new proposals are likely to be made in the future.\nThe implementation of the ACA in the United States may adversely affect our business.\nAs a result of the adoption of the ACA, in the United States, substantial changes are being made to the current system for paying for healthcare in the United States, including programs to extend medical benefits to millions of individuals who currently lack insurance coverage. The changes contemplated by the ACA are subject to rule-making and implementation timelines that extend for several years, as well as initiatives in Congress to amend or repeal the law, and this uncertainty limits our ability to forecast changes that may occur in the future. However, implementation of the ACA has already begun with respect to certain significant cost-saving measures, including changes to several government healthcare programs that may cover the cost of our future products and diagnostic tests, including Medicaid, Medicare Parts B and D, and these efforts could have a materially adverse impact on our future financial prospects and performance. For example, with respect to Medicaid, in order for a manufacturer\u2019s products to be reimbursed by federal funding under Medicaid, the manufacturer must enter into a Medicaid rebate agreement with the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, and must pay certain rebates to the states based on utilization data provided by each state to the manufacturer and to CMS, and based on pricing data provided by the manufacturer to the federal government. The states share this savings with the federal government, and sometimes implement their own additional supplemental rebate programs. Under the Medicaid drug rebate program, the rebate amount for most branded drug products was previously equal to a minimum of 15.1% of the Average Manufacturer Price, or AMP, or the AMP less Best Price, whichever is greater. Effective January 1, 2010, the ACA generally increased the size of the Medicaid rebates paid by manufacturers for single source and innovator multiple source (brand name) drug product from a minimum of 15.1% to a minimum of 23.1% of the AMP, subject to certain exceptions, for example, for certain clotting factors, the increase is limited to a minimum of 17.1% of the AMP. For non-innovator multiple source (generic) products, the rebate percentage is increased from a minimum of 11.0% to a minimum of 13.0% of AMP. These increases in required rebates may adversely affect our future financial prospects and performance. The ACA also creates new rebate obligations for products under Medicare Part D, a partial, voluntary prescription drug benefit created by the United States federal government primarily for persons 65 years old and over. The Part D drug program is administered through private insurers that contract with CMS. Beginning in 2011, the healthcare reform law generally requires that in order for a drug manufacturer\u2019s products to be reimbursed under Medicare Part D, the manufacturer must enter into a Medicare Coverage Gap Discount Program agreement with the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, and reimburse each Medicare Part D plan sponsor an amount equal to 50% savings for the manufacturer\u2019s brand name drugs and biologics which the Part D plan sponsor has provided to its Medicare Part D beneficiaries who are in the \u201cdonut hole\u201d (or a gap in Medicare Part D coverage for beneficiaries who have expended certain amounts for drugs). The Part D plan sponsor is responsible for calculating and providing the discount directly to its beneficiaries and for reporting these amounts paid to CMS\u2019s contractor, which notifies drug manufacturers of the rebate amounts it must pay to each Part D plan sponsor. The rebate requirement could adversely affect our future financial performance, particularly if contracts with Part D plans cannot be favorably renegotiated or the Part D plan sponsors fail to accurately calculate payments due in a manner that overstates our rebate obligation.\nTable of Content\nThe ACA also introduced a biosimilar pathway that will permit companies to obtain FDA approval of generic versions of existing biologics based upon reduced documentation and data requirements deemed sufficient to demonstrate safety and efficacy than are required for the pioneer biologics. The new law provides that a biosimilar application may be submitted as soon as four years after the reference product is first licensed, and that the FDA may not make approval of an application effective until 12 years after the reference product was first licensed. With the likely introduction of biosimilars in the United States, we expect in the future to face greater competition from biosimilar products, including a possible increase in patent challenges. The FDA has reported meeting with sponsors who are interested in developing biosimilar products, and is developing regulations to implement the abbreviated regulatory review pathway. Regarding access to our products, the ACA established and provided significant funding for a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to coordinate and fund Comparative Effectiveness Research, or CER. While the stated intent of CER is to develop information to guide providers to the most efficacious therapies, outcomes of CER could influence the reimbursement or coverage for therapies that are determined to be less cost-effective than others. Should any of our products be determined to be less cost effective than alternative therapies, the levels of reimbursement for these products, or the willingness to reimburse at all, could be impacted, which could materially impact our future financial prospects and results.\nCMS recently proposed a new plan to alter Medicare Part B, which pays for medications administered in doctors\u2019 officers or outpatient hospital clinics. The new plan aims to eliminate incentives for doctors to use the most expensive drugs. Under the current plan, Medicare Part B reimburses doctors or clinics for the cost of the medication plus a 6% fee. CMS plans to test a reimbursement formula that would pay the cost of the drug, plus a 2.5% surcharge and a flat fee of $16.80. CMS hopes that the proposed plan would cut costs by eliminating incentives to choose high priced drugs over ones that may be more appropriate. CMS is planning to test various value-based pricing ideas that would pay for drugs according how well they work. For example, if a medication is effective in eliminating one condition but is also used on a second condition with less success, Medicare would pay less when it is used for the second condition than the first. Certain private health insurance plans are also implementing similar new reimbursement procedures for physicians administered medications that will base reimbursements on the effectiveness of the selected drug. CMS\u2019 proposed plans are open for public comment until May 9, 2016, and field tests will begin upon completion of the comment period. While the ultimate adoption of the proposals is uncertain, if adopted, the plans could affect doctors\u2019 utilization of any therapeutic products that we may successfully develop.\nTable of Content\nRisks Related to our Dependence on Third Parties\nAsterias could lose its CIRM grant if Asterias fails to meet the clinical trial milestones that are a condition to CIRM\u2019s obligation to provide funding\nAsterias depends on its grant from CIRM as a source of financing for the costs of conducting its Phase I/IIa clinical trial and process development of AST-OPC1. Under the terms of the CIRM grant, Asterias must meet certain efficacy and progress milestones pertaining to the clinical trial. If Asterias fails to meet any of the milestones within the specified time frame, CIRM may discontinue providing grant funds to Asterias, which could force Asterias to postpone, delay, or discontinue the clinical trial and development work for the product.\nIf we fail to enter into and maintain successful strategic alliances for our therapeutic product candidates, we may have to reduce or delay our product development or increase our expenditures\nAn important element of our strategy for developing, manufacturing and commercializing our therapeutic product candidates will be entering into strategic alliances with pharmaceutical companies or other industry participants to advance our programs and enable us to maintain our financial and operational capacity. We will face significant competition in seeking appropriate alliances. We may not be able to negotiate alliances on acceptable terms, if at all. If we fail to create and maintain suitable alliances, we may have to limit the size or scope of, or delay, one or more of our product development or research programs, or we will have to increase our expenditures and will need to obtain additional funding, which may be unavailable or available only on unfavorable terms.\nIf we are able to enter into product development and marketing arrangements with pharmaceutical companies, we may license product development, manufacturing, and marketing rights to the pharmaceutical company or to a joint venture company formed with the pharmaceutical company. Under such arrangements we might receive only a royalty on sales of the products developed or an equity interest in a joint venture company that develops the product. As a result, our revenues from the sale of those products may be substantially less than the amount of revenues and gross profits that we might receive if we were to develop, manufacture, and market the products ourselves.\nWe may become dependent on possible future collaborations to develop and commercialize many of our product candidates and to provide the regulatory compliance, sales, marketing and distribution capabilities required for the success of our business\nWe may enter into various kinds of collaborative research and development and product marketing agreements to develop and commercialize our products. The expected future milestone payments and cost reimbursements from collaboration agreements could provide an important source of financing for our research and development programs, thereby facilitating the application of our technology to the development and commercialization of our products, but there are risks associated with entering into collaboration arrangements.\nThere is a risk that we could become dependent upon one or more collaborative arrangements. A collaborative arrangement upon which we might depend might be terminated by our collaboration partner or a partner might determine not to actively pursue the development or commercialization of our products. A collaboration partner also may not be precluded from independently pursuing competing products and drug delivery approaches or technologies.\nThere is a risk that a collaboration partner might fail to perform its obligations under the collaborative arrangements or may be slow in performing its obligations. In addition, a collaboration partner may experience financial difficulties at any time that could prevent it from having available funds to contribute to the collaboration. If a collaboration partner fails to conduct its product development, commercialization, regulatory compliance, sales and marketing or distribution activities successfully and in a timely manner, or if it terminates or materially modifies its agreements with us, the development and commercialization of one or more product candidates could be delayed, curtailed or terminated because we may not have sufficient financial resources or capabilities to continue such development and commercialization on our own.\nTable of Content\nWe have very limited experience in marketing, selling or distributing our products, and we may need to rely on marketing partners or contract sales companies\nEven if we are able to develop our products and obtain necessary regulatory approvals, we have very limited experience or capabilities in marketing, selling or distributing our products. We rely entirely on Hospira and CJ Health for the sale of Hextend\u00ae. Ascendance currently has only limited sales, marketing and distribution resources for selling its assay and stem cell research products, and we and our other subsidiaries have no other marketing or distribution resources for selling any of the medical devices or therapeutic products that are being developed. Accordingly, we and our subsidiaries will be dependent on our ability to build our own marketing and distribution capability for our new products, which would require the investment of significant financial and management resources, or we will need to find collaborative marketing partners or sales representatives, or wholesale distributors for the commercial sale of our products.\nIf we market products through arrangements with third parties, we may pay sales commissions to sales representatives or we may sell or consign products to distributors at wholesale prices. As a result, our gross profit from product sales may be lower than it would be if we were to sell our products directly to end users at retail prices through our own sales force. There can be no assurance we will able to negotiate distribution or sales agreements with third parties on favorable terms to justify our investment in our products or achieve sufficient revenues to support our operations.\nWe do not have the ability to independently conduct clinical trials required to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates\nWe will need to rely on third parties, such as contract research organizations, data management companies, contract clinical research associates, medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories to conduct any clinical trials that we may undertake for our products. We may also rely on third parties to assist with our preclinical development of product candidates. If we outsource clinical trial we may be unable to directly control the timing, conduct and expense of our clinical trials. If we enlist third parties to conduct clinical trials and they fail to successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations or fail to meet expected deadlines, if the third parties need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our preclinical development activities or clinical trials may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates.\nRisks Related to the Asset Contribution Agreement With Geron\nWe could be liable to indemnify Geron from certain liabilities\nUnder the Asset Contribution Agreement through which Asterias acquired Geron\u2019s stem cell assets (the \u201cAsset Contribution Agreement\u201d), we and Asterias have agreed to indemnify Geron from and against certain liabilities relating to (a) the distribution of shares of Asterias Series A common stock to Geron stockholders, (b) Asterias\u2019 distribution of certain BioTime warrants to the holders of Asterias Series A common stock, and (c) any distribution of securities by Asterias to the holders of the Asterias Series A common stock within one year following Asterias\u2019 acquisition of Geron\u2019s stem cell assets. That indemnification obligation will last through the fifth anniversary of the expiration, exercise, cancellation or sale of the BioTime warrants whichever occurs first.\nWe and Asterias have also agreed to indemnify Geron, from and against certain expenses, losses, and liabilities arising from, among other things, breaches of our or Asterias\u2019 representations, warranties and covenants under the Asset Contribution Agreement. The maximum damages that may be recovered by either party for a loss under this indemnification related to representations, warranties and covenants, with certain exceptions, is limited to $2,000,000.\nTable of Content\nAsterias\u2019 operations may divert our management\u2019s attention away from ongoing operations and could adversely affect ongoing operations and business relationships\nNow that Asterias has acquired Geron\u2019s stem cell assets and is conducting its own research and development programs, our management will be required to provide more management attention to Asterias. The diversion of our management\u2019s attention away from our other operations could adversely affect our operations and business relationships that do not relate to Asterias.\nRisks Related to OncoCyte\u2019s Business Operations\nOncoCyte has determined that the initial diagnostic tests that it plans to develop and commercialize will be LDTs that will be performed at a diagnostic laboratory that OncoCyte plans to operate. The decision to develop and commercialize LDTs will give rise to certain risks related to the operation of the business of operating a diagnostic laboratory and performing LDTs, including the following risks.\nOncoCyte will need to obtain regulatory approval of its diagnostic laboratory facilities\nOncoCyte will need to receive certification for its planned diagnostic laboratory under the CLIA. In addition to meeting federal regulatory requirements, each state has its own laboratory certification and inspection requirements for a CLIA laboratory that must be met in order to sell diagnostic tests in the state. CLIA licensed laboratories can lose their licenses if problems arise during periodic regulatory inspections.\nThe FDA may impose additional regulations for laboratory developed tests such as the ones OncoCyte is developing\nThe FDA issued two draft guidance documents that set forth a proposed risk-based regulatory framework that would apply varying levels of FDA oversight to LDTs such as those OncoCyte is developing. If the FDA implements new regulatory measures:\n\u00b7 OncoCyte may be required to obtain pre-market clearance or approval before selling its diagnostic tests;\n\u00b7 As a result of required FDA pre-market review, OncoCyte\u2019s tests may not be cleared or approved on a timely basis, if at all;\n\u00b7 FDA labeling requirements may limit OncoCyte\u2019s claims about its diagnostic tests, which may have a negative effect on orders from physicians;\n\u00b7 The regulatory approval process may involve, among other things, successfully completing additional clinical trials and making a 510(k) submission, or filing a pre-market approval application with the FDA; and,\n\u00b7 If regulatory actions affect any of the reagents OncoCyte obtain from suppliers and use in conducting its tests, its business could be adversely affected in the form of increased costs of testing or delays, limits or prohibitions on the purchase of reagents necessary to perform its testing.\nOncoCyte will depend on Medicare and a limited number of private payers for a significant portion of its revenues, and its revenues could decline if these payers fail to provide timely and adequate payment for its diagnostic tests\nOncoCyte expects that a substantial portion of the patients for whom it will perform diagnostic tests will have Medicare as their primary medical insurance. Even if OncoCyte\u2019s planned tests are otherwise successful, reimbursement for the Medicare-covered portions of its planned tests might not, without Medicare reimbursement, produce sufficient revenues to enable it to reach profitability and achieve its other commercial objectives.\nMedicare and other third-party payers have increased their efforts to control the cost, utilization, and delivery of health care services, and have undertaken measures to reduce payment rates for and decrease utilization of clinical laboratory testing. Because of the cost-trimming trends, any third-party payers that will cover and provide reimbursement for OncoCyte\u2019s diagnostic tests may suspend, revoke or discontinue coverage at any time, or may reduce the reimbursement rates payable to OncoCyte. Any such action could have a negative impact on OncoCyte\u2019s revenues, which may have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nTable of Content\nChanges in healthcare laws and policies may have a material adverse effect on OncoCyte\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows\nThe ACA substantially changed the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the ACA\u2019s key changes, the ACA reduced payment rates under the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule and established an Independent Payment Advisory Board to reduce the per capita rate of growth in Medicare spending if spending exceeds a target growth rate. Such provisions may negatively impact payment rates for OncoCyte\u2019s diagnostic tests.\nThe Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (\u201cPAMA\u201d) significantly altered the payment methodology under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule that determines Medicare coverage for laboratory tests. Under PAMA, clinical laboratories are required to report test payment data for each Medicare-covered clinical diagnostic lab test and beginning in 2017, the Medicare payment rate for each clinical diagnostic lab test will be equal to the weighted median amount for the test from the most recent data collection period.\nCongress has proposed on several occasions to impose a 20% coinsurance payment requirement on patients for clinical laboratory tests reimbursed under the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, which would require OncoCyte to bill patients for these amounts. In the event that Congress were to ever enact such legislation, the cost of billing and collecting for OncoCyte\u2019s tests could often exceed the amount actually received from the patient.\nOn September 25, 2015, CMS released preliminary determinations for the calendar year 2016 for the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule for some test codes, including some for oncology diagnostics, as had been anticipated. These preliminary determinations were based on a cross walk approach rather than a gap-fill approach. A cross walk approach matches a new code for a diagnostic against existing codes to determine the appropriate payment rate; while a gap-fill approach looks at local pricing patterns, including charges for the tests and any discounts on charges and payments determined by other payers. At this point it is not clear what methodology CMS may use in their determinations for future diagnostics.\nBeginning January 1, 2017, Medicare payment for any new advanced diagnostic test will be based on the list price or charge. After the test is commercially available for two quarters, the laboratory will be required to report payment and volume information and that data will be used to set payment for the test for the following year.\n\u00b7 If data shows that the list price was greater than 130% of the payment using established methodology (a weighted median), CMS will recoup the difference from the laboratory through a payment claw back.\n\u00b7 Payment will be updated annually based on the weighted median of commercial payer reimbursement.\nWe cannot predict whether future health care initiatives will be implemented at the federal or state level, or how any future legislation or regulation may affect OncoCyte. The expansion of government\u2019s role in the U.S. health care industry as a result of the ACA, and changes to the reimbursement amounts paid by Medicare and other payers for diagnostic tests may have a materially adverse effect on OncoCyte\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nBecause of certain Medicare billing policies, OncoCyte may not receive complete reimbursement for tests provided to Medicare patients\nMedicare has coverage policies that can be national or regional in scope. Coverage means that the test or assay is approved as a benefit for Medicare beneficiaries. If there is no coverage, neither the supplier nor any other party, such as a diagnostic laboratory, may receive reimbursement from Medicare for the service. Regional policies are directed by Medicare\u2019s regional Medicare Administrative Contractors (\u201cMACs\u201d). Reimbursement for diagnostic testing may be negatively impacted by California MAC policies.\nTable of Content\nLong payment cycles of Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payors, or other payment delays, could hurt OncoCyte\u2019s cash flows and increase its need for working capital\nMedicare and Medicaid have complex billing and documentation requirements that OncoCyte will have to satisfy in order to receive payment. Failure to comply with these requirements and other laws applicable to billing may result in, among other things, non-payment, refunds, exclusion from government healthcare programs, and civil or criminal liabilities, any of which may have a material adverse effect on OncoCyte\u2019s revenues and earnings. Similarly, the failure of private health insurers or other private third-party payers to properly process OncoCyte\u2019s payment claims in a timely manner could delay its receipt of payment for its diagnostic tests and services, which may have a material adverse effect on its cash flows.\nPrivate health insurance company policies may deny coverage or limit the amount they will reimburse OncoCyte for the performance of its diagnostic tests\nPatients who are not covered by Medicare will generally rely on health insurance provided by private health insurance companies. If OncoCyte is considered a \u201cnon-contracted provider\u201d by a third-party payer, that payer may not reimburse patients for diagnostic tests performed by OncoCyte or doctors within the payer\u2019s network of covered physicians may not use its services to perform diagnostic tests for their patients. As a result, OncoCyte may need to enter into contracts with health insurance companies or other private payers to provide diagnostic tests to their insured patients at specified rates of reimbursement which may be lower than the rates OncoCyte might otherwise collect.\nRisks Pertaining to Our Common Shares\nOwnership of our common shares will entail certain risks associated with the volatility of prices for our common shares and the fact that we do not pay dividends on our common shares.\nBecause we are engaged in the development of pharmaceutical and stem cell therapy products and cancer diagnostic tests, the price of our common shares may rise and fall rapidly\n\u00b7 The market price of our common shares, like that of the shares of many biotechnology companies, has been highly volatile.\n\u00b7 The price of our common shares may rise rapidly in response to certain events, such as the commencement of clinical trials of an experimental new therapy or diagnostic test, even though the outcome of those trials and the likelihood of ultimate FDA approval of a therapeutic product remain uncertain.\n\u00b7 Similarly, prices of our common shares may fall rapidly in response to certain events such as unfavorable results of clinical trials or a delay or failure to obtain FDA approval.\n\u00b7 The failure of our earnings to meet analysts\u2019 expectations could result in a significant rapid decline in the market price of our common shares.\nCurrent economic and stock market conditions may adversely affect the price of our common shares\nThe stock market has been experiencing extreme price and volume fluctuations which have affected the market price of the equity securities without regard to the operating performance of the issuing companies. Broad market fluctuations, as well as general economic and political conditions, may adversely affect the market price of our common shares.\nTable of Content\nBecause we do not pay dividends, our common shares may not be a suitable investment for anyone who needs to earn dividend income\nWe do not pay cash dividends on our common shares. For the foreseeable future, we anticipate that any earnings generated in our business will be used to finance the growth of our business and will not be paid out as dividends to holders of our common shares. This means that our common shares may not be a suitable investment for anyone who needs to earn income from their investments.\nSecurities analysts may not initiate coverage or continue to cover our common shares and this may have a negative impact on the market price of our common shares\nThe trading market for our common shares will depend, in part, on the research and reports that securities analysts publish about our business and our common shares. We do not have any control over these analysts. There is no guarantee that securities analysts will cover our common shares. If securities analysts do not cover our common shares, the lack of research coverage may adversely affect the market price of those shares. If securities analysts do cover our common shares, they could issue reports or recommendations that are unfavorable to the price of our common shares, and they could downgrade a previously favorable report or recommendation, and in either case our share prices could decline as a result of the report. If one or more of these analysts does not initiate coverage, ceases to cover our common shares or fails to publish regular reports on our business, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share prices or trading volume to decline.\nInvestors in our common shares may experience dilution of their ownership interests because of the future issuance of additional common shares and preferred shares by us and our subsidiaries\nIn the future, we may issue our authorized but previously unissued equity securities, resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of our present shareholders. We are currently authorized to issue an aggregate of 127,000,000 shares of capital stock consisting of 125,000,000 common shares and 2,000,000 \u201cblank check\u201d preferred shares. As of December 31, 2015, there were 94,894,140 common shares outstanding of which 4,472,586 were held by our subsidiaries, 5,194,313 common shares reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding options under our employee stock option plans; and 9,190,782 shares reserved for issuance upon the exercise of common share purchase warrants, including the publicly traded warrants.\nThe operation of some of our subsidiaries has been financed in part through the sale of capital stock in those subsidiaries to private investors. Sales of additional subsidiary shares could reduce our ownership interest in the subsidiaries, and correspondingly dilute our shareholder\u2019s ownership interests in our consolidated enterprise. Our subsidiaries also have their own stock option plans and the exercise of subsidiary stock options or the sale of restricted stock under those plans would also reduce our ownership interest in the subsidiaries, with a resulting dilutive effect on the ownership interest of our shareholders in our consolidated enterprise.\nWe and our subsidiaries may issue additional common shares or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for common shares in order to raise additional capital, or in connection with hiring or retaining employees or consultants, or in connection with future acquisitions of licenses to technology or rights to acquire products, or in connection with future business acquisitions, or for other business purposes. The future issuance of any such additional common shares or other securities may create downward pressure on the trading price of our common shares.\nWe may also issue preferred shares having rights, preferences, and privileges senior to the rights of our common shares with respect to dividends, rights to share in distributions of our assets if we liquidate our company, or voting rights. Any preferred shares may also be convertible into common shares on terms that would be dilutive to holders of common shares. Our subsidiaries may also issue their own preferred shares with a similar dilutive impact on our ownership of the subsidiaries.\nTable of Content\nThe market price of our common shares could be impacted by prices at which we sell shares in our subsidiaries\nThe operation of some our subsidiaries has been financed in part through the sale of capital stock in those subsidiaries, and our subsidiaries may sell shares of their capital stock in the future for financing purposes. The prices at which our subsidiaries may sell shares of their capital stock could impact the value of our company as a whole and could impact the price at which our common shares trade in the market. A sale of capital stock of one of our subsidiaries at a price that the market perceives as low could adversely impact the market price of our common shares. Even if our subsidiaries sell their capital stock at prices that reflect arm\u2019s length negotiation with investors, there is no assurance that those prices will reflect a true fair market value or that the ascribed value of the subsidiaries based on those share prices will be fully reflected in the market value of our common shares.", "PERMNO": 77393, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "LCTX"}
