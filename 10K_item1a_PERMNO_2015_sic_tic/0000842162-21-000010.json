{"cik": "842162", "company": "LEAR CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-10", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nOur business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows may be impacted by a number of factors. In addition to the factors affecting our business identified elsewhere in this Report, the material risk factors affecting our operations include the following:\nRisks Related to Our Business\n\u2022Our industry is cyclical and a decline in the production levels of our major customers, particularly with respect to models for which we are a significant supplier, or the financial distress of one or more of our major customers could adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur sales are driven by the number of vehicles produced by our automotive manufacturer customers, which is ultimately dependent on consumer demand for automotive vehicles, and our content per vehicle. The automotive industry is cyclical and sensitive to general economic conditions, including the global credit markets, interest rates, consumer credit and consumer spending and preferences. Automotive sales and production can also be affected by the age of the vehicle fleet and related scrappage rates, labor relations issues, fuel prices, regulatory requirements, government initiatives, trade agreements, tariffs and other non-tariff trade barriers, the availability and cost of credit, the availability of critical components needed to complete the production of vehicles, restructuring actions of our customers and suppliers, facility closures and increased competition, as well as consumer preferences regarding vehicle size, configuration and features, including alternative fuel vehicles, changing consumer attitudes toward vehicle ownership and usage, such as ride sharing and on-demand transportation, and other factors.\nDue to the overall global economic conditions in 2020, largely as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the automotive industry experienced a decline in global customer sales and production volumes. In 2020, global vehicle production decreased 17% as compared to 2019. In Asia, vehicle production decreased 12%, including 5% in China and 23% in India. Vehicle production also decreased 20% and 22% in North America and Europe and Africa, respectively. As a result, we have experienced and may continue to experience reductions in orders from our customers in certain regions. An economic downturn or other adverse industry conditions that result in a decline in the production levels of our major customers, particularly with respect to models for which we are a significant supplier, or the financial distress of one or more of our major customers could reduce our sales or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Further, our ability to reduce the risks inherent in certain concentrations of business, and thereby maintain our financial performance in the future, will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to diversify our sales on a customer, product, platform and geographic basis to reflect the market overall. We may not be successful in such diversification.\n\u2022Pandemics or disease outbreaks, such as COVID-19, have disrupted, and may continue to disrupt, our business, which could adversely affect our financial performance.\nPandemics or disease outbreaks, such as COVID-19, have disrupted, and may continue to disrupt, the global economy. The COVID-19 pandemic led to a dramatic reduction in economic activity worldwide. International, federal, state and local public health and governmental authorities have taken and may continue to take extraordinary actions to contain and combat the outbreak and spread of COVID-19 throughout most regions of the world, including travel bans, quarantines, \"stay-at-home\" orders and similar mandates that have caused many individuals to substantially restrict their daily activities and many businesses to curtail or cease normal operations.\nThe automotive industry was particularly negatively impacted by the situation with a sudden and sharp decline in consumer demand and automotive manufacturers suspending or severely limiting automobile production globally during portions of 2020. In 2020, we experienced, and we may continue to experience, reductions in orders from our customers globally, which in turn adversely affected, and may continue to affect, our financial performance. This reduction in orders may be further exacerbated by a continued global economic downturn resulting from the pandemic, which could decrease consumer demand for vehicles or result in the financial distress of one or more of our customers or suppliers. As described in more detail under \"Our industry is cyclical and a decline in the production levels of our major customers, particularly with respect to models for which we are a significant supplier, or the financial distress of one or more of our major customers could adversely affect our financial performance\" above and \"Adverse developments affecting or the financial distress of one or more of our suppliers could adversely affect our financial performance\" below, decreases in consumer demand for automotive vehicles, declines in the production levels of our major customers, financial distress of one or more of our major customers or suppliers or other adverse developments affecting one or more of our suppliers, could adversely affect our financial performance. In addition, if COVID-19 were to affect a significant amount of the workforce employed or operating at our facilities, we could experience delays or the inability to produce and deliver products to our customers on a timely basis.\nUnprecedented industry disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic impacted operations in every region of the world. As described in more detail under \"Our substantial international operations make us vulnerable to risks associated with doing business in foreign countries\" below, our substantial international operations make us vulnerable to risks associated with doing business in foreign countries.\nWhile all of our global manufacturing plants have resumed production, we may experience unexpected delays or obstacles, such as higher employee absenteeism, supply chain disruptions or government mandates, that may hamper our ability to operate our facilities. Further, we may not be able to operate at optimal levels of efficiency given new work rules and procedures implemented to protect our employees. The suspension of production at our manufacturing facilities, or difficulties or inefficiencies in production, would likely adversely impact our future results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and that impact may be material.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, our reliance on internet technology has increased due to the number of employees working remotely. This reliance has resulted in increased cybersecurity risks, including the risk that we fail to appropriately maintain the security of the data we hold. See \"A disruption in our information technology systems, or those of our customers or suppliers, including a disruption related to cybersecurity, could adversely affect our financial performance\" below.\nAs described in more detail under \"Our existing indebtedness and the inability to access capital markets could restrict our business activities or our ability to execute our strategic objectives or adversely affect our financial performance\" below, the volatility created by COVID-19 could adversely affect our access to the debt and capital markets. In addition, our ability to continue implementing important strategic initiatives and capital expenditures may be reduced as we devote time and other resources to responding to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCOVID-19 continues to spread in most regions of the world and the extent to which our financial performance will be adversely affected will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the pandemic, its severity, the effectiveness of actions to vaccinate populations, contain the virus or treat its impact and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience adverse impacts on our business and financial performance as a result of its global economic impact, including a recession that has occurred or may occur in the future, which will likely result in lower demand for new vehicles for a period of time, as new vehicle sales are typically correlated with positive consumer confidence and low unemployment.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks disclosed herein, including, but not limited to, our competitiveness, demand for our products and shifting consumer preferences.\n\u2022The loss of business with respect to, or the lack of commercial success of, a vehicle model for which we are a significant supplier could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe receive purchase orders from our customers, which generally provide for the supply of a customer\u2019s annual requirements for a particular vehicle model and assembly plant or, in some cases, for the supply of a customer\u2019s requirements for the life of a particular vehicle model, rather than for the purchase of a specific quantity of products. In addition, it is possible that our customers could elect to manufacture our products internally or increase the extent to which they require us to utilize specific suppliers or materials in the manufacture of our products. The loss of business with respect to, the lack of commercial success of or an increase in directed component sourcing for a vehicle model for which we are a significant supplier could reduce our sales or margins and thereby adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\n\u2022Our inability to achieve product cost reductions to offset customer-imposed price reductions could adversely affect our financial performance.\nDownward pricing pressure by automotive manufacturers is a characteristic of the automotive industry. Our customer contracts generally provide for annual price reductions over the production life of the vehicle, while requiring us to assume significant responsibility for the design, development and engineering of our products. Prices may also be adjusted on an ongoing basis to reflect changes in product content/costs and other commercial factors. Our financial performance is largely dependent on our ability to achieve product cost reductions through product design enhancement and supply chain management, as well as manufacturing efficiencies and restructuring actions. We also seek to enhance our financial performance by investing in product development, design capabilities and new product initiatives that respond to the needs of our customers and consumers. We continually evaluate operational and strategic alternatives to align our business with the changing needs of our customers and improve our business structure by investing in vertical integration opportunities globally. Our inability to achieve product cost reductions that offset customer-imposed price reductions could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\n\u2022Increases in the costs and restrictions on the availability of raw materials, energy, commodities and product components could adversely affect our financial performance.\nRaw material, energy and commodity costs can be volatile. Although we have developed and implemented strategies to mitigate the impact of higher raw material, energy and commodity costs, these strategies, together with commercial negotiations with our customers and suppliers, typically offset only a portion of the adverse impact. Certain of these strategies also may limit our opportunities in a declining commodity environment. In addition, the availability of raw materials, commodities and product components fluctuates from time to time due to factors outside of our control, including trade laws and tariffs. If the costs of raw materials, energy, commodities and product components increase or the availability thereof is restricted, it could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\n\u2022Adverse developments affecting or the financial distress of one or more of our suppliers could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe obtain components and other products and services from numerous Tier 2 automotive suppliers and other vendors throughout the world. We are responsible for managing our supply chain, including suppliers that may be the sole sources of products that we require, that our customers direct us to use or that have unique capabilities that would make it difficult and/or expensive to re-source. In certain instances, entire industries may experience short-term capacity constraints. Additionally, our production capacity, and that of our customers and suppliers, may be adversely affected by natural disasters. Any such significant disruption could adversely affect our financial performance. Furthermore, unfavorable economic or industry conditions could result in financial distress within our supply base, thereby increasing the risk of supply disruption. An economic downturn or other unfavorable industry conditions in one or more of the regions in which we operate could cause a supply disruption and thereby adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\n\u2022Our substantial international operations make us vulnerable to risks associated with doing business in foreign countries.\nAs a result of our global presence, a significant portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We have substantial manufacturing and distribution facilities in many foreign countries, including Mexico and countries in Africa, Asia, Central and South America and Europe. International operations are subject to certain risks inherent in doing business abroad, including:\n\u2022exposure to local economic conditions;\n\u2022political, economic and civil instability and uncertainty (including acts of terrorism, civil unrest, drug-cartel related and other forms of violence and outbreaks of war);\n\u2022labor unrest;\n\u2022expropriation and nationalization;\n\u2022currency exchange rate fluctuations, currency controls and the ability to economically hedge currencies;\n\u2022withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries;\n\u2022investment restrictions or requirements;\n\u2022repatriation restrictions or requirements;\n\u2022export and import restrictions and increases in duties and tariffs;\n\u2022concerns about human rights, working conditions and other labor rights and conditions and the environmental impact in foreign countries where our products are produced and raw materials and/or components are sourced, as well as changing labor, environmental and other laws in these countries;\n\u2022pandemic illness;\n\u2022increases in working capital requirements related to long supply chains; and\n\u2022global sovereign fiscal matters and creditworthiness, including potential defaults and the related impacts on economic activity, including the possible effects on credit markets, currency values, monetary unions, international treaties and fiscal policies.\nExpanding our sales and operations in Asia and our manufacturing operations in lower-cost regions are important elements of our strategy. As a result, our exposure to the risks described above is substantial. The likelihood of such occurrences and their potential effect on us vary from country to country and are unpredictable. However, any such occurrences could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\n\u2022We operate in a highly competitive industry and efforts by our competitors, as well as new non-traditional entrants to the industry, to gain market share could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry. We and most of our competitors are seeking to expand market share with new and existing customers, including in Asia and other potential high growth regions. Our customers award business based on, among other things, price, quality, service and technology. Our competitors\u2019 efforts to grow market share could exert downward pressure on our product pricing and margins. In addition, the automotive industry has attracted, and will continue to attract, non-traditional entrants as a result of the evolving nature of the automotive vehicle market, including autonomous vehicles, ride sharing and on-demand transportation. Further, the global automotive industry is experiencing a period of significant technological change, including a focus on environmentally sustainable vehicles and subcomponents. As a result, the success of portions of our business requires us to develop, acquire and/or incorporate new technologies and depends not only on our customers' ability to execute their strategies to exploit these technologies but also on the adoption of such technologies by end consumers. Such technologies are subject to rapid obsolescence. Our inability to maintain access to these technologies (through development, acquisition or licensing) may adversely affect our ability to compete. If we are unable to differentiate our products, maintain a low-cost footprint or compete effectively with technology-focused new market entrants, we may lose market share or be forced to reduce prices, thereby lowering our margins. Any such occurrences could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\n\u2022A significant labor dispute involving us or one or more of our customers or suppliers or that could otherwise affect our operations could adversely affect our financial performance.\nA substantial number of our employees and the employees of our largest customers and suppliers are members of industrial trade unions and are employed under the terms of various labor agreements. We have labor agreements covering approximately 82,500 employees globally. In the United States and Canada, each of our unionized facilities has a separate collective bargaining agreement with the union that represents the workers at such facility, with each such agreement having an expiration date that is independent of the other agreements. Labor agreements covering approximately 85% of our global unionized work force, including labor agreements in the United States and Canada covering approximately 1% of our global unionized workforce, are scheduled to expire in 2021. There can be no assurances that future negotiations with the unions will be resolved favorably or that we will not experience a work stoppage or disruption that could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. A labor dispute involving us, any of our customers or suppliers or any other suppliers to our customers or that otherwise affects our operations, or the inability by us, any of our customers or suppliers or any other suppliers to our customers to negotiate, upon the expiration of a labor agreement, an extension of such agreement or a new agreement on satisfactory terms could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. In addition, if any of our significant customers experience a material work stoppage, such as the General Motors labor strike in the fall of 2019, that customer may halt or limit the purchase of our products. This could require us to shut down or significantly reduce production at facilities relating to such products, which could adversely affect our business and harm our profitability.\n\u2022Certain of our operations are conducted through joint ventures which have unique risks.\nCertain of our operations, particularly in emerging markets, are conducted through joint ventures. With respect to our joint ventures, we may share ownership and management responsibilities with one or more partners that may not share our goals and objectives. Operating a joint venture requires us to operate the business pursuant to the terms of the agreement that we entered into with our partners, including additional organizational formalities, as well as to share information and decision making. Additional risks associated with joint ventures include one or more partners failing to satisfy contractual obligations, conflicts arising between us and any of our partners, a change in the ownership of any of our partners and less of an ability to control compliance with applicable rules and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and related rules and regulations. Additionally, our ability to sell our interest in a joint venture may be subject to contractual and other limitations. Accordingly, any such occurrences could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\n\u2022Our inability to effectively manage the timing, quality and costs of new program launches could adversely affect our financial performance.\nIn connection with the award of new business, we obligate ourselves to deliver new products and services that are subject to our customers\u2019 timing, performance and quality standards. Additionally, as a Tier 1 supplier, we must effectively coordinate the activities of numerous suppliers in order for the program launches of our products to be successful. Given the complexity of new program launches, we may experience difficulties managing product quality, timeliness and associated costs. In addition, new program launches require a significant ramp up of costs; however, our sales related to these new programs generally are dependent upon the timing and success of our customers\u2019 introduction of new vehicles.\nOur inability to effectively manage the timing, quality and costs of these new program launches could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\n\u2022Significant changes in discount rates, the actual return on pension assets and other factors could adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur earnings may be positively or negatively impacted by the amount of income or expense recorded related to our global defined benefit plans. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States require that income or expense related to the defined benefit plans be calculated at the annual measurement date using actuarial calculations, which reflect certain assumptions. The most significant of these assumptions relate to interest rates, the capital markets and other economic conditions. These assumptions, as well as the actual value of pension assets at the measurement date, will impact the calculation of pension and other postretirement benefit expense for the year. Although pension expense and pension contributions are not directly related, the key economic indicators that affect pension expense also affect the amount of cash that we will contribute to our pension plans. Because interest rates and the values of these pension assets have fluctuated and will continue to fluctuate in response to changing market conditions, pension and other postretirement benefit expense in subsequent periods, the funded status of our pension plans and the future minimum required pension contributions, if any, could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\n\u2022Impairment charges relating to our goodwill and long-lived assets could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe regularly monitor our goodwill and long-lived assets for impairment indicators. In conducting our goodwill impairment testing, we may first perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit\u2019s fair value is less than its carrying amount. If not, no further goodwill impairment testing is required. If it is more likely than not that a reporting unit\u2019s fair value is less than its carrying amount, or if we elect not to perform a qualitative assessment of a reporting unit, we then compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the related net book value. If the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is measured and recognized. In conducting our impairment analysis of long-lived assets, we compare the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the long-lived assets to the related net book values. Changes in economic or operating conditions impacting our estimates and assumptions could result in the impairment of our goodwill or long-lived assets. In the event that we determine that our goodwill or long-lived assets are impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings that could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\n\u2022Our failure to execute our strategic objectives could adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur financial performance depends, in part, on our ability to successfully execute our strategic objectives. Our objectives are to deliver superior long-term stockholder value by investing in innovation to drive business growth and profitability, while maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning excess cash to our stockholders. Various factors, including the industry environment and the other matters described herein and in Part II - Item 7, \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" including \"- Forward-Looking Statements,\" could adversely affect our ability to execute our strategic objectives. These risk factors include our failure to identify suitable opportunities for organic investment and/or acquisitions, our inability to successfully develop such opportunities or complete such acquisitions or our inability to successfully utilize or integrate the investments in our operations. Our failure to execute our strategic objectives could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Moreover, there can be no assurances that, even if implemented, our strategic objectives will be successful.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\n\u2022Our existing indebtedness and the inability to access capital markets could restrict our business activities or our ability to execute our strategic objectives or adversely affect our financial performance.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $2.3 billion of outstanding indebtedness, as well as $1.75 billion available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2020, there were no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility. The debt instruments governing our indebtedness contain covenants that may restrict our business activities or our ability to execute our strategic objectives, and our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under our indebtedness. We also lease certain buildings and equipment under non-cancelable lease agreements with terms exceeding one year, which are accounted for as operating leases. Additionally, any downgrade in the ratings that rating agencies assign to us and our debt may ultimately impact our access to capital markets. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt and lease obligations, to refinance our debt obligations or to access capital markets on commercially reasonable terms could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\n\u2022Changes affecting the availability of the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") may have consequences for us that cannot yet be reasonably predicted.\nWe have outstanding debt with variable interest rates based on LIBOR. Advances under our revolving credit facility and our term loan facility generally bear interest based on (i) the Eurocurrency Rate (as defined in our credit agreement and calculated using LIBOR) or (ii) the ABR (as defined in our credit agreement). The LIBOR benchmark has been the subject of national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals to reform. In July 2017, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. These reforms may cause LIBOR to perform differently than it has in the past, and LIBOR may ultimately cease to exist after 2021. Alternative benchmark rates may replace LIBOR and could affect our debt securities, debt payments and receipts. At this time, it is not possible to predict the effect of any changes to LIBOR, any phase out of LIBOR or any establishment of alternative benchmark rates. Any new benchmark rate will likely not replicate LIBOR exactly, which could impact our contracts that terminate after 2021. There is uncertainty about how applicable law and the courts will address the replacement of LIBOR with alternative rates on variable rate retail loan contracts and other contracts that do not include alternative rate fallback provisions. If LIBOR ceases to exist after 2021, the interest rates on our revolving credit facility and our term loan facility will be based on the ABR, which may result in higher interest rates. In addition, any changes to benchmark rates may have an uncertain impact on our cost of funds and our access to the capital markets, which could impact our results of operations and cash flows. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential changes may also adversely affect the trading market for our securities.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\n\u2022A disruption in our information technology systems, or those of our customers or suppliers, including a disruption related to cybersecurity, could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe rely on the accuracy, capacity and security of our information technology networks. Despite the security measures that we have implemented, including those measures related to cybersecurity, our operational systems (including business, financial, accounting, human resources, product development and manufacturing processes), as well as those of our customers, suppliers and other service providers, and certain of our connected vehicle systems and components that may collect and store sensitive end-user data (which could include personally identifiable information) could be breached or damaged by computer viruses, malware, phishing attacks, denial-of-service attacks, human error, natural or man-made incidents or disasters or unauthorized physical or electronic access. These types of incidents have become more prevalent and pervasive across industries, including our industry, and are expected to continue in the future. The secure operation of our information technology networks, and the processing and maintenance of information by these networks, is critical to our operations and strategy. A breach could result in business disruption, including the vehicle systems and components that we supply to our customers or our plant operations, theft of our intellectual property, trade secrets or customer information or unauthorized access to personal information, such as that of our employees or end consumers of vehicles that contain certain of our connected vehicle systems or components. Although cybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our operational systems and products from attack, damage or unauthorized access are a high priority for us, our actions and investments may not be deployed quickly enough or successfully protect our systems against all vulnerabilities, including technologies developed to bypass our security measures. In addition, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers to disclose access credentials or other sensitive information in order to gain access to our secure systems and networks. There are no assurances that our actions and investments to improve the maturity of our systems, processes and risk management framework or remediate vulnerabilities will be sufficient or deployed quickly enough to prevent or limit the impact of any cyber intrusion or security breach. Moreover, because the techniques used to gain access to or sabotage systems often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate the methods necessary to defend against these types of attacks, and we cannot predict the extent, frequency or impact these attacks may have on us. To the extent that our business is interrupted, including the vehicle systems and components that we supply to our customers or our plant operations, or data is lost, destroyed or inappropriately used or disclosed, such disruptions could adversely affect our competitive position, relationships with our customers, financial condition, operating results and cash flows and/or subject us to regulatory actions, including those contemplated by data privacy laws and regulations like the European Union General Data Privacy Regulation and California Consumer Privacy Act, or litigation. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against the damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.\nWe are also dependent on security measures that some of our customers, suppliers and other third-party service providers take to protect their own systems and infrastructures. Any security breach of any of these third-parties' systems could result in unauthorized access to our or our customers\u2019 or suppliers' sensitive data or our own information technology systems, cause us to be non-compliant with applicable laws or regulations, subject us to legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our\noperations, damage our reputation or cause a loss of confidence in our products or services, any of which could adversely affect our financial performance.\n\u2022A significant product liability lawsuit, warranty claim or product recall involving us or one of our major customers could adversely affect our financial performance.\nIn the event that our products fail to perform as expected, regardless of fault, and such failure results in, or is alleged to result in, bodily injury and/or property damage or other losses, we may be subject to product liability lawsuits and other claims or we may be required or requested by our customers to participate in a recall or other corrective action involving such products. We also are a party to agreements with certain of our customers, whereby these customers may pursue claims against us for contribution of all or a portion of the amounts sought in connection with product liability and warranty claims. We carry insurance for certain product liability claims, but such coverage may be limited. We do not maintain insurance for product warranty or recall matters. In addition, we may not be successful in recovering amounts from third parties, including sub-suppliers, in connection with these claims. These types of claims could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\n\u2022We are involved from time to time in various legal and regulatory proceedings and claims, which could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe are involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings and claims that, from time to time, are significant. These are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business including, without limitation, commercial or contractual disputes, including disputes with our customers, suppliers or competitors, intellectual property matters, personal injury claims, environmental matters, tax matters, employment matters and antitrust matters. No assurances can be given that such proceedings and claims will not adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\n\u2022New laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe and the automotive industry are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including those related to health, safety and environmental matters. Governmental regulations also affect taxes and levies, capital markets, healthcare costs, energy usage, data privacy, international trade and immigration and other labor issues, all of which may have a direct or indirect effect on our business and the businesses of our customers and suppliers. We cannot predict the substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulations, or the application thereof. The introduction of new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations, or the interpretation thereof, could increase the costs of doing business for us or our customers or suppliers or restrict our actions and adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\n\u2022We are subject to regulation of our international operations that could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe are subject to many laws governing our international operations, such as those that pertain to data privacy, prohibit improper payments to government officials and restrict where we can do business and what information or products we can supply to or purchase from certain countries or third parties, including but not limited to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.S. Export Administration Act. Violations of these laws, which are complex, may conflict with laws of other jurisdictions and often are difficult to interpret and apply, could result in significant fines, criminal penalties or sanctions that could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\n\u2022We are required to comply with environmental laws and regulations that could cause us to incur significant costs.\nOur manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect the environment, and we expect that additional requirements with respect to environmental matters will be imposed on us and our customers in the future. Material future expenditures may be necessary if compliance standards change or material unknown conditions that require remediation are discovered. Environmental laws could also restrict our ability to expand our facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses in connection with our business. If we fail to comply with present and future environmental laws and regulations, we could be subject to future liabilities, which could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\n\u2022Developments or assertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe own significant intellectual property, including a large number of patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets, and we are involved in numerous licensing arrangements. Our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve. Developments or assertions by or against us relating to intellectual property rights could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\n\u2022Changes in U.S. administrative policy, including changes to existing trade agreements and any resulting changes in international relations, could adversely affect our financial performance.\nAs a result of changes to U.S. administrative policy, among other possible changes, there may be (i) changes in policies pertaining to the environment; (ii) changes to existing trade agreements; (iii) greater restrictions on free trade generally; and (iv) significant increases in customs duties and tariffs on goods imported into the United States. The United States, Mexico and Canada signed a new trade agreement, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (\"USMCA\"), which serves as the successor agreement to the North American Free Trade Agreement (\"NAFTA\"). The USMCA became effective on July 1, 2020. There can be no assurance that the ongoing transition from NAFTA to USMCA will not adversely affect our business. The United States still maintains significant tariffs on most imports from China. It remains unclear what specific actions the new U.S. administration may take to resolve trade-related issues with China and other countries. A trade war, other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements, changes in U.S. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories and countries where we currently manufacture and sell products or any resulting negative sentiments towards the United States could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\n\u2022Changes in the United Kingdom's economic and other relationships with the European Union could adversely affect us.\nIn December 2020, the United Kingdom finalized a free trade agreement with the European Union, the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (\"TCA\"), to manage future bilateral trade and formally completed its withdrawal from the European Union. Thus, effective January 1, 2021, trade between the European Union and the United Kingdom is now subject to border controls and imported goods must meet bilateral content rules as set out in the TCA to qualify for duty-free trade.\nWe have significant operations in both the European Union and the United Kingdom. In 2020, our European Union (excluding the United Kingdom) and United Kingdom sales totaled $4.5 billion and $0.6 billion, respectively. Our supply chain and that of our customers are highly integrated across the European Union and the United Kingdom, and we are highly dependent on the free flow of goods in those regions. We have implemented procedures to manage our supply chains with the new border controls and to comply with the TCA\u2019s bilateral content rules. However, there can be no assurance that the new border controls and content rules will not adversely impact our competitive position, supplier and customer relationships and financial performance.", "PERMNO": 93101, "SIC": 2531, "TIC": "LEA"}
