If any of these risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and reputation could be harmed. You should also consider these risk factors when you read \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d elsewhere in this report. You can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as \u201cmay,\u201d \u201chope,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cpredict,\u201d \u201cpotential\u201d or \u201ccontinue,\u201d the negative of those terms or other comparable terms. Those forward-looking statements are only predictions and can be adversely affected if any of these risks occur.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nCertain of our subsidiaries have filed Chapter 11 petitions to resolve asbestos litigation.\nThe historical business operations of certain of our subsidiaries, principally GST LLC and The Anchor Packing Company (\u201cAnchor\u201d), have resulted in a substantial volume of asbestos litigation in which plaintiffs have alleged personal injury or death as a result of exposure to asbestos fibers. Those subsidiaries manufactured and/or sold industrial sealing products, predominately gaskets and packing products, which contained encapsulated asbestos fibers. Anchor is inactive and insolvent, there is no remaining insurance coverage available to Anchor and it has no assets. Our subsidiaries\u2019 exposure to asbestos litigation and their relationships with insurance carriers has been actively managed through another subsidiary, Garrison Litigation Management Group, Ltd. (\u201cGarrison,\u201d collectively with GST LLC and Anchor, \u201cGST\u201d). On the GST Petition Date, GST LLC, Anchor and Garrison filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of North Carolina in Charlotte (the \u201cBankruptcy Court\u201d) to address these claims (the \u201cGST Chapter 11 Case\u201d). These subsidiaries have been deconsolidated from our financial statements since the GST Petition Date.\nAlthough no current EnPro subsidiary other than GST LLC and Anchor has ever made indemnity payments to asbestos claimants, thousands of claims have been made in the past against Coltec Industries Inc (\u201cColtec\u201d), a subsidiary which has since been merged into our OldCo, LLC subsidiary (\u201cOldCo\u201d), and its former businesses based principally on alleged exposure to asbestos-containing gaskets and other components in equipment sold by those businesses. Coltec and its insurers have spent several million dollars defending those claims. At the GST Petition Date, thousands of claims alleging exposure to asbestos contained in products sold by Coltec and its former businesses were pending, but have been stayed by the Bankruptcy Court during the pendency of the GST Chapter 11 Case.\nOn March 17, 2016, we announced that we had reached a comprehensive consensual settlement (the \u201cConsensual Settlement\u201d) to resolve current and future asbestos claims. The Consensual Settlement was reached with both the official committee representing current asbestos claimants (the \u201cGST Current Asbestos Claimants\u2019 Committee\u201d) in the GST Chapter 11 Case and the court-appointed representative of future asbestos claimants (the \u201cGST Future Claimants\u2019 Representative\u201d) in the GST Chapter 11 Case, as well as with ad-hoc representatives for current and future asbestos claimants (the \u201cAd-hoc Representatives\u201d) against Coltec. The terms of the settlement are set forth in the Term Sheet for Permanent Resolution of All Present and Future GST Asbestos Claims and Coltec Asbestos Claims dated March 17, 2016 among EnPro, Coltec, GST, the GST Current Asbestos Claimants\u2019 Committee, the GST Future Claimants\u2019 Representative and the Ad-hoc Representatives included as Exhibit 99.2 to our Form 8-K furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 18, 2016. Under the Consensual Settlement, the GST Current Asbestos Claimants\u2019 Committee, the GST Future Claimants\u2019 Representative and the Ad-hoc Representatives agreed to join GST and Coltec (and OldCo as the successor by merger to Coltec) in proposing a joint plan of reorganization (the \u201cJoint Plan\u201d) that incorporates the Consensual Settlement and to ask asbestos claimants and the Bankruptcy Court and the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina (the \u201cDistrict Court\u201d) to approve the Joint Plan. The Joint Plan was filed with the Bankruptcy Court in the GST Chapter 11 Case on May 20, 2016 and technical amendments to the Joint Plan were filed with the Bankruptcy Court on June 21, 2016, July 29, 2016 and December 2, 2016. The Joint Plan supersedes all prior plans of reorganization filed by GST in the GST Chapter 11 Case.\nIf approved and consummated, the Joint Plan would permanently resolve current and future asbestos claims against GST and OldCo, as the successor by merger to Coltec, and would protect EnPro and its subsidiaries from those claims, under Section 524(g) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Before the Joint Plan may be consummated, it is required to be approved by the\nBankruptcy Court and the District Court and by a vote of GST asbestos claimants and Coltec asbestos claimants by 75% or more in number and at least two-thirds (2/3) in dollar amount of claims that are actually voted.\nThe Consensual Settlement and Joint Plan provide that the Joint Plan is a prepackaged plan of reorganization as to Coltec/OldCo and that Coltec will undertake the Coltec Restructuring (described below) and commence a Chapter 11 case to obtain confirmation of the Joint Plan if Coltec asbestos claimants and GST asbestos claimants voted in sufficient numbers to approve the Joint Plan. Accordingly, the Coltec asbestos claimants and GST asbestos claimants were solicited simultaneously for their vote on the approval of the Joint Plan prior to the filing of a Chapter 11 case by Coltec or OldCo. The solicitation process to obtain approval of the asbestos claimants was completed successfully on December 9, 2016, with 95.85% in number and 95.80% in amount of claims held by asbestos claimants casting valid ballots voting in favor of approval of the Joint Plan.\nThe Joint Plan and Consensual Settlement contemplate that, as an appropriate and necessary step to facilitate the implementation of the Consensual Settlement and not to delay or hinder creditors or the resolution of claims, Coltec would, subject to the receipt of necessary consents, undergo a corporate restructuring (the \u201cColtec Restructuring\u201d) in which all of its significant operating assets and subsidiaries, which included each of our major business units, would be distributed to a new direct EnPro subsidiary, EnPro Holdings, Inc., which was formerly named New Coltec, Inc. (\u201cEnPro Holdings\u201d). EnPro Holdings would also assume all of Coltec\u2019s non-asbestos liabilities. The Coltec Restructuring was completed on December 31, 2016, and included the merger of Coltec with and into OldCo, which is a direct subsidiary of EnPro Holdings. OldCo, as the restructured entity, retained responsibility for all asbestos claims and rights to certain insurance assets of Coltec, as well as the business operated by our EnPro Learning System, LLC subsidiary (\u201cEnPro Learning System\u201d), which provides occupational safety training and consulting services to third parties. EnPro Learning System was also merged into OldCo and had revenues in 2016 of approximately $0.4 million.\nIn connection with the Coltec Restructuring, the obligations of OldCo, as the successor by merger to Coltec, under an original issue amount $73.4 million Amended and Restated Promissory Note due January 1, 2018 (the \u201cColtec Note\u201d) in favor of GST LLC, and Coltec\u2019s guaranty of an original issue amount $153.8 million Amended and Restated Promissory Note due January 1, 2018 entered into by our Stemco LP subsidiary in favor of GST LLC (the \u201cStemco Note\u201d) were assumed by EnPro Holdings, and OldCo was released from those obligations. In addition, the Coltec Note and the Stemco Note were amended to extend their maturity date to January 1, 2018. Following the Coltec Restructuring and prior to the filing of the Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition by OldCo described below, OldCo was released from its obligations under our senior secured revolving credit facility and designated as an \u201cunrestricted subsidiary\u201d under the indenture governing our 5.875% Senior Notes due 2022, as a result of which it was automatically released from its obligations under such indenture. In connection with the restructuring, EnPro Holdings entered into a keep well agreement with OldCo, which is enforceable by third-party beneficiaries. Under the keep well agreement, EnPro Holdings agreed to make equity contributions to OldCo sufficient, together with other funds available to OldCo, to permit OldCo to pay and discharge its liabilities as they become due and payable, other than under the Coltec Note, the guarantee of the Stemco Note, the senior secured revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our 5.875% Senior Notes due 2022 (OldCo having been separately released from its obligations under each of those instruments).\nThe Joint Plan contemplates the establishment of a trust (the \u201cTrust\u201d) to be fully funded within a year of consummation of the Joint Plan. The Trust is to be funded (i) with aggregate cash contributions by GST LLC and Garrison of $370 million made at the effective date of the Joint Plan, (ii) by the contribution made by OldCo at the effective date of consummation of the Joint Plan of $30 million in cash and an option, exercisable one year after the effective date of consummation of the Joint Plan, permitting the Trust to purchase for $1 shares of EnPro common stock having a value of $20 million (with OldCo having the right to call the option for payment of $20 million in cash at any time prior to the first anniversary of the effective date, with the Trust having the right to put the option to OldCo for payment by OldCo of $20 million on the day prior to the first anniversary of the effective date and with the option terminating on the second anniversary of the effective date of consummation of the Joint Plan in return for payment to the Trust of $20 million), and (iii) by the obligation under the Joint Plan of OldCo to make a deferred contribution of $60 million in cash no later than one year after the effective date of the Joint Plan. This deferred contribution is to be guaranteed by EnPro and secured by a pledge of 50.1% of the outstanding voting equity interests of GST LLC and Garrison. Under the Joint Plan, the Trust would assume responsibility for all present and future asbestos claims arising from the operations or products of GST or Coltec/OldCo. Under the Joint Plan, all non-asbestos creditors would be paid in full and EnPro, through its subsidiaries, would retain ownership of OldCo, GST LLC and Garrison.\nAs contemplated by the Joint Plan and the Consensual Settlement, on January 30, 2017 (the \u201cOldCo Petition Date\u201d), OldCo filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition with the Bankruptcy Court (the \u201cOldCo Chapter 11 Case\u201d). As a result of that filing, OldCo will be deconsolidated from our financial statements commencing on the OldCo Petition Date. On February 3, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order for the joint administration of the OldCo Chapter 11 Case with the GST Chapter 11 Case. The Bankruptcy Court has scheduled the confirmation hearing on the Joint Plan to commence on May 15, 2017 and set,\nas the deadlines for filing objections to the Joint Plan, December 9, 2016 in the GST Chapter 11 Case and March 24, 2017 in the OldCo Chapter 11 Case.\nAlthough no asbestos claimant or creditor filed any objection to the Joint Plan in the GST Chapter 11 Case, objections have been filed by the appointed bankruptcy administrator and by three insurers. The technical objection filed by the bankruptcy administrator, which is a non-judicial, federal appointee that is involved in cases from a perspective independent of an interested party, concerns the scope of the Joint Plan\u2019s \u201cexculpatory\u201d provisions that would extend limited protection to the debtors in the case, their affiliates, committees appointed in the case, the future claimants\u2019 representative and their respective professional advisors from liability for ancillary claims related to their actions or failure to act in connection with the case. The objections of the three insurers primarily concern the impact of the Joint Plan on insurance policies and related contracts to which they are parties. The hearing on objections to the Joint Plan filed in both proceedings will be part of the confirmation hearings for approval of the Joint Plan by the Bankruptcy Court scheduled to commence on May 15, 2017.\nThe Consensual Settlement includes as a condition to our obligations to proceed with the settlement that EnPro, Coltec, GST and Garlock of Canada Ltd (an indirect subsidiary of GST LLC) enter into a written agreement, to be consummated concurrently with the effective date of consummation of the Joint Plan, with the Canadian provincial workers\u2019 compensation boards (the \u201cProvincial Boards\u201d) resolving remedies the Provincial Boards may possess against Garlock of Canada Ltd, GST, Coltec or any of their affiliates, including releases and covenants not to sue, for any present or future asbestos-related claim, and that the agreement is either approved by the Bankruptcy Court following notice to interested parties or the Bankruptcy Court concludes that its approval is not required. On November 11, 2016, we entered into such an agreement (the \u201cCanadian Settlement\u201d) with the Provincial Boards to resolve current and future claims against EnPro, GST, Garrison, Coltec, and Garlock of Canada Ltd. for recovery of a portion of amounts the Provincial Boards have paid and will pay in the future under asbestos-injury recovery statutes in Canada for claims relating to asbestos-containing products. The Canadian Settlement provides for an aggregate cash settlement payment to the Provincial Boards of $20 million (U.S.), payable on the fourth anniversary of the effective date of the Joint Plan. Under the Canadian Settlement, after the effective date of the Joint Plan, the Provincial Boards will have the option of accelerating the payment, in which case the amount payable would be discounted from the fourth anniversary of the effective date of the Joint Plan to the payment date at a discount rate of 4.5% per annum. This is consistent with the present value estimate of approximately $17 million, before tax, that we committed for the resolution of these claims when entering into the Consensual Settlement. In return, the Provincial Boards have separately agreed to provide a covenant not to sue EnPro, any of EnPro\u2019s affiliates or the Trust for any present or future asbestos-related claims. On February 3, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order approving the Canadian Settlement.\nThe Consensual Settlement includes as an additional condition to our obligations to proceed with the settlement that we receive a private letter ruling from the IRS that the Trust will be recognized as a \u201cdesignated settlement fund\u201d or \u201cqualified settlement fund\u201d under section 468B of the Internal Revenue Code, and any related regulations (or, if such a ruling is not available, a legal opinion satisfactory in form and substance to us that the IRS will so recognize the Trust). On February 6, 2017, the IRS issued a private letter ruling satisfying this condition.\nUnder the Consensual Settlement and Joint Plan, GST and OldCo will retain their rights to seek reimbursement under insurance policies for any amounts they have paid in the past to resolve asbestos claims and for $480 million in aggregate contributions they will make to the Trust under the Joint Plan. As of December 31, 2016, approximately $62.0 million of available products hazard limits or insurance receivables arising from settlements with insurance carriers existed to cover claims against both GST and OldCo from solvent carriers with investment grade ratings. The Joint Plan provides that GST and OldCo are entitled to collect and retain 100% of any settlements and judgments related to these insurance policies.\nIn addition, Coltec purchased a number of primary and excess general liability insurance policies that were in effect prior to January 1, 1976 (the \u201cPre-Garlock Coverage Block\u201d). The policies provide coverage for \u201coccurrences\u201d happening during the policy periods and cover losses associated with product liability claims against Coltec and certain of its subsidiaries. Asbestos claims against GST are not covered under these policies because GST was not a Coltec subsidiary prior to 1976.\nOldCo may have rights against primary and excess general liability insurance policies in the Pre-Garlock Coverage Block to recover its contributions to the Trust. Such rights, however, are disputed and uncertain. Of the Pre-Garlock Coverage Block, the bulk of the primary coverage was provided under six policies issued by Insurance Company of North America (\u201cINA\u201d). INA disputes that coverage exists under these policies, claiming that Coltec released such coverage when it settled coverage under separate policies INA issued to GST and Anchor. In addition, $7.2 million of the primary coverage in the Pre-Garlock Coverage Block was issued by American Motorists Insurance Co., which is in insolvency proceedings.\nThe Joint Plan provides that OldCo may retain the first $25 million of any settlements and judgments related to insurance policies in the Pre-Garlock Coverage Block and OldCo and the Trust will share equally in any settlements and judgments OldCo may collect in excess of $25 million.\nThe confirmation and consummation of the Joint Plan, and accordingly the final resolution of asbestos claims against GST and OldCo in accordance with the Joint Plan, are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, which could have the effect of delaying or preventing the confirmation and consummation of the Joint Plan, increasing our costs in connection with effecting the Consensual Settlement, the Canadian Settlement and the consummation of the Joint Plan or reducing the benefit to us related to the consummation of the Joint Plan and the Canadian Settlement. In light of these risks and uncertainties, we cannot assure you that the Joint Plan and the Canadian Settlement will be consummated on the time schedule that we anticipate or at all, or if consummated that we will recognize all benefits from the consummation of the Joint Plan and the Canadian Settlement that we anticipate. These risks and uncertainties include:\n\u2022\nthe risk that the Joint Plan is not approved by the Bankruptcy Court and the District Court and that orders so approving the Joint Plan do not become final; and\n\u2022\nrisks and uncertainties about whether any interested parties may further object to the Joint Plan or appeal any order issued by the Bankruptcy Court or District Court approving the Joint Plan, which objections and appeals, even if favorably resolved, may delay the consummation of the Joint Plan and increase our costs in connection with such proceedings.\nIn addition, our subsidiaries\u2019 filing of Chapter 11 bankruptcy petitions and matters related to asbestos claims exposes us to a number of other risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u2022\nPossible changes in the value of the deconsolidated subsidiaries reflected in our financial statements. Our investment in GST is, and for periods ending after the OldCo Petition Date our investment in OldCo will be, subject to periodic reviews for impairment. To estimate the fair value, the Company considers many factors and uses both discounted cash flow and market valuation approaches. The asbestos claims value is an important part of the value of that investment. The actual value will be determined in the Chapter 11 process, and accordingly adverse developments with respect to the terms of the resolution of such claims that differ from the terms of the Joint Plan and the Canadian Settlement may materially adversely affect the value of our investments in GST and OldCo.\n\u2022\nThe financial viability of our subsidiaries\u2019 insurance carriers and their reinsurance carriers, and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to collect on claims from them. Agreements with certain of these insurance carriers and the terms of applicable policies define specific annual amounts to be paid or limit the amount that can be recovered in any one year, and accordingly substantial insurance payments for submitted claims have been deferred and are payable in installments through 2018, and an additional $38.0 million of other insurance payments may be payable only upon the conclusion of the bankruptcy process. OldCo\u2019s ability to collect insurance from policies in the Pre-Garlock Coverage Block may depend on litigation, the outcome, cost, and timing of which is uncertain.\n\u2022\nThe costs of the bankruptcy proceedings and the length of time necessary to resolve the cases. Through December 31, 2016, GST has recorded Chapter 11 case-related fees and expenses totaling $159.9 million. We have recorded an additional $11.0 million in case-related fees and expenses incurred directly by EnPro, Coltec and OldCo.\nFor a further discussion of the filings and the asbestos exposure of our subsidiaries, see Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview and Outlook,\u201d \u201c- Contingencies - Asbestos\u201d and \u201c-Contingencies - Subsidiary Bankruptcies,\u201d and Notes 19 and 20 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this report.\nOur business and some of the markets we serve are cyclical and distressed market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe markets in which we sell our products, particularly chemical companies, petroleum refineries, heavy-duty trucking, semiconductor manufacturing, capital equipment and the automotive industry, are, to varying degrees, cyclical and have historically experienced periodic downturns. Prior downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand, excess manufacturing capacity and subsequent erosion of average selling prices in these markets resulting in negative effects on our net sales, gross margins and net income. The recent recession affected our results of operations. A prolonged and severe downward cycle in our markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe face intense competition that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe encounter intense competition in almost all areas of our businesses. Customers for many of our products are attempting to reduce the number of vendors from which they purchase in order to reduce inventories. To remain competitive, we need to invest continuously in manufacturing, marketing, customer service and support and our distribution networks. We also need to develop new products to continue to meet the needs and desires of our customers. We may not have sufficient\nresources to continue to make such investments or maintain our competitive position. Additionally, some of our competitors are larger than we are and have substantially greater financial resources than we do. As a result, they may be better able to withstand the effects of periodic economic downturns. Certain of our products may also experience transformation from unique branded products to undifferentiated price sensitive products. This product commoditization may be accelerated by low cost foreign competition. Changes in the replacement cycle of certain of our products, including because of improved product quality or improved maintenance, may affect aftermarket demand for such products. Initiatives designed to distinguish our products through superior service, continuous improvement, innovation, customer relationships, technology, new product acquisitions, bundling with key services, long-term contracts or market focus may not be effective. Pricing and other competitive pressures could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we fail to retain the independent agents and distributors upon whom we rely to market our products, we may be unable to effectively market our products and our revenue and profitability may decline.\nThe marketing success of many of our businesses in the U.S. and abroad depends largely upon our independent agents\u2019 and distributors\u2019 sales and service expertise and relationships with customers in our markets. Many of these agents have developed strong ties to existing and potential customers because of their detailed knowledge of our products. A loss of a significant number of these agents or distributors, or of a particular agent or distributor in a key market or with key customer relationships, could significantly inhibit our ability to effectively market our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIncreased costs for raw materials, the termination of existing supply agreements or disruptions of our supply chain could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe prices for some of the raw materials we purchase increased in 2016. While we have been successful in passing along some or all of these higher costs, there can be no assurance we will be able to continue doing so without losing customers. Additionally, our Power Systems segment has entered into long-term contracts to manufacture and sell engines which do not allow for price adjustments to recover additional costs resulting from increases in the costs of materials and components during the contract period, and accordingly material increases in relevant costs could adversely affect the profitability of these long-term contracts and the profits of that segment. Similarly, the loss of a key supplier or the unavailability of a key raw material could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nReductions in the U.S. Navy\u2019s requirements for engines offered by Fairbanks Morse could materially adversely affect the results of our Power Systems segment and our business with the U.S. Navy and other governmental agencies is subject to government contracting risks.\nSales of new engines for use by the U.S. Navy by our Power Systems segment, which have been a significant component of that segment\u2019s revenues, are based on the U.S. Navy\u2019s long-term ship-building programs. Although the Power Systems segment has expanded its activities in other markets, including the sale of diesel engine generator sets for emergency back-up power at nuclear power plants in France and the establishment of an exclusive distribution arrangement with a German engine manufacturer in the power generation industry in the U.S., any decline in demand from the U.S. Navy could materially adversely affect the results of our Power Systems segment.\nOur business with the U.S. Navy, and other governmental agencies, including sales to prime contractors that supply these agencies, is subject to government contracting risks. U.S. government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract. If terminated by the government as a result of our default, we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers. In addition, if we or one of our divisions were charged with wrongdoing with respect to a U.S. government contract, the U.S. government could suspend us from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings. If convicted or found liable, the U.S. government could subject us to fines, penalties, repayments and treble and other damages, and/or bar us from bidding on or receiving new awards of U.S. government contracts and void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud. The U.S. government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent, criminal or other seriously improper conduct.\nWe have exposure to some contingent liabilities relating to previously owned businesses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in any fiscal period.\nWe have contingent liabilities related to discontinued operations, including previously owned businesses of our predecessors, including environmental liabilities and liabilities for certain products and other matters. In some instances we have indemnified others against those liabilities, and in other instances we have received indemnities from third parties against those liabilities.\nClaims could arise relating to products, facilities or other matters related to our discontinued operations. Some of these claims could seek substantial monetary payments. For example, Coltec has received a notice from the Environmental Protection Agency asserting that Coltec is a potentially responsible party under federal environmental laws as the successor to a former operator in the 1950s of eight uranium mines in Arizona. In addition, in connection with a facility located in Water Valley, Mississippi, which was divested in 1996 and at which Coltec has been managing trichloroethylene soil and groundwater contamination, the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality issued an order against EnPro requiring evaluation of potential vapor intrusion into residential homes and commercial facilities located over the groundwater plume as well as requiring additional groundwater investigation and remediation, and area homeowners, owners of commercial facilities and the local county government and possibly other private parties and individuals have reportedly engaged legal counsel to separately evaluate possible legal action. Further, we could potentially be liable with respect to firearms manufactured prior to March 1990 by Colt Firearms, a former operation of Coltec, and electrical transformers manufactured prior to May 1994 by Central Moloney, another former Coltec operation. Coltec also has ongoing obligations with regard to workers compensation, retiree medical and other retiree benefit matters associated with discontinued operations in connection with Coltec\u2019s periods of ownership of those operations. These and other potential liabilities of Coltec (other than with respect to claims related to asbestos exposure) have been assumed by EnPro Holdings in the Coltec Restructuring.\nWe have insurance and reserves to address some of these liabilities. However, if our insurance coverage is depleted or our reserves are not adequate, environmental and other liabilities relating to discontinued operations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe conduct a significant amount of our sales activities outside of the U.S., which subjects us to additional business risks, including foreign exchange risks, that may cause our profitability to decline.\nBecause we sell our products in a number of foreign countries, we are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. In 2016, we derived approximately 43% of our net sales from sales of our products outside of the U.S. Our international operations are, and will continue to be, subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nunfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including long-term contracts denominated in foreign currencies;\n\u2022\nadverse changes in foreign tax, legal and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in protecting intellectual property;\n\u2022\ntrade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;\n\u2022\ncultural norms and expectations that may sometimes be inconsistent with our Code of Conduct and our requirements about the manner in which our employees, agents and distributors conduct business;\n\u2022\ndiffering labor regulations;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability, including instabilities associated with European sovereign debt uncertainties and the future continuity of membership of the European Union; and\n\u2022\nacts of hostility, terror or war.\nAny of these factors, individually or together, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations outside the United States require us to comply with a number of United States and international regulations. For example, our operations in countries outside the United States are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d), which prohibits United States companies or their agents and employees from providing anything of value to a foreign official for the purposes of influencing any act or decision of these individuals in their official capacity to help obtain or retain business, direct business to any person or corporate entity, or obtain any unfair advantage. Our activities in countries outside the United States create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees or agents that could be in violation of the FCPA, even though these parties are not always subject to our control. We have internal control policies and procedures and have implemented training and compliance programs with respect to the FCPA. However, we cannot assure that our policies, procedures and programs always will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. In the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees or agents have or may have violated applicable anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances. In addition, we are subject to and must comply with all applicable export controls and economic sanctions laws and embargoes imposed by the United States and other various governments. Changes in export control or trade sanctions laws may restrict our business practices, including cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries or with sanctioned entities, and may result in modifications to compliance programs and increase\ncompliance costs, and violations of these laws or regulations may subject us to fines, penalties and other sanctions, such as loss of authorizations needed to conduct aspects of our international business or debarments from export privileges. Violations of the FCPA or export controls or sanctions laws and regulations may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe intend to continue to pursue international growth opportunities, which could increase our exposure to risks associated with international sales and operations. As we expand our international operations, we may also encounter new risks that could adversely affect our revenues and profitability. For example, as we focus on building our international sales and distribution networks in new geographic regions, we must continue to develop relationships with qualified local agents, distributors and trading companies. If we are not successful in developing these relationships, we may not be able to increase sales in these regions.\nFailure to properly manage these risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights and knowledge relating to our products, our business and prospects may be negatively impacted.\nWe believe that proprietary products and technology are important to our success. If we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property and know-how, our business and prospects could be negatively impacted. Our efforts to protect our intellectual property through patents, trademarks, service marks, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, confidentiality, non-compete and nondisclosure agreements and other measures may not be adequate to protect our proprietary rights. Patents issued to third parties, whether before or after the issue date of our patents, could render our intellectual property less valuable. Questions as to whether our competitors\u2019 products infringe our intellectual property rights or whether our products infringe our competitors\u2019 intellectual property rights may be disputed. In addition, intellectual property rights may be unavailable, limited or difficult to enforce in some jurisdictions, which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share in those jurisdictions.\nOur competitors may capture market share from us by selling products that claim to mirror the capabilities of our products or technology. Without sufficient protection nationally and internationally for our intellectual property, our competitiveness worldwide could be impaired, which would negatively impact our growth and future revenue. As a result, we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights.\nWe have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions, which could involve certain risks and uncertainties.\nWe expect to continue to make acquisitions in the future. Acquisitions involve numerous inherent challenges, such as properly evaluating acquisition opportunities, properly evaluating risks and other diligence matters, ensuring adequate capital availability and balancing other resource constraints. There are risks and uncertainties related to acquisitions, including: difficulties integrating acquired technology, operations, personnel and financial and other systems; unrealized sales expectations from the acquired business; unrealized synergies and cost savings; unknown or underestimated liabilities; diversion of management attention from running our existing businesses and potential loss of key management employees of the acquired business. In addition, internal controls over financial reporting of acquired companies may not be up to required standards. Our integration activities may place substantial demands on our management, operational resources and financial and internal control systems. Customer dissatisfaction or performance problems with an acquired business, technology, service or product could also have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business.\nOur business may be adversely affected by information technology disruptions.\nOur business may be impacted by information technology disruptions, including information technology attacks. Cybersecurity attacks, in particular, are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data (our own or that of third parties). We believe that we have adopted appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our systems from information technology-related disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, misappropriation, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems or networks, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability, and/or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business could be materially adversely affected by numerous other risks, including rising healthcare costs, changes in environmental laws and other unforeseen business interruptions.\nOur business may be negatively impacted by numerous other risks. For example, medical and healthcare costs may continue to increase. Initiatives to address these costs, such as consumer driven health plan packages, may not successfully reduce these expenses as needed. Failure to offer competitive employee benefits may result in our inability to recruit or maintain key employees. Other risks to our business include potential changes in environmental rules or regulations, which could negatively impact our manufacturing processes. Use of certain chemicals and other substances could become restricted or such changes may otherwise require us to incur additional costs which could reduce our profitability and impair our ability to offer competitively priced products. Additional risks to our business include global or local events which could significantly disrupt our operations. Terrorist attacks, natural disasters, political insurgencies, pandemics and electrical grid disruptions and outages are some of the unforeseen risks that could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile.\nA relatively small number of shares traded in any one day could have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including in response to the risks described in this section and elsewhere in this report or for reasons unrelated to our operations, such as reports by industry analysts, investor perceptions or negative announcements by our customers, competitors or suppliers regarding their own performance, as well as industry conditions and general financial, economic and political instability.\nBecause our quarterly revenues and operating results may vary significantly in future periods, our stock price may fluctuate.\nOur revenue and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter. A high proportion of our costs are fixed, due in part to significant selling and manufacturing costs. Small declines in revenues could disproportionately affect operating results in a quarter and the price of our common stock may fall. We may also incur charges to income to cover increases in the estimate of our subsidiaries\u2019 future asbestos liability. Other factors that could affect quarterly operating results include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\ndemand for our products;\n\u2022\nthe timing and execution of customer contracts;\n\u2022\nthe timing of sales of our products;\n\u2022\nincreases in manufacturing costs due to equipment or labor issues;\n\u2022\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nchanges in applicable tax rates;\n\u2022\nan impairment in the value of our investment in GST or OldCo;\n\u2022\nan impairment of goodwill at one of our reporting units;\n\u2022\nunanticipated delays or problems in introducing new products;\n\u2022\nthe incurrence of contractual penalties for the late delivery of long lead-time products;\n\u2022\nannouncements by competitors of new products, services or technological innovations;\n\u2022\nchanges in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors;\n\u2022\nincreased expenses, whether related to sales and marketing, raw materials or supplies, product development or administration;\n\u2022\nmajor changes in the level of economic activity in major regions of the world in which we do business;\n\u2022\ncosts related to possible future acquisitions or divestitures of technologies or businesses;\n\u2022\nan increase in the number or magnitude of product liability or environmental claims;\n\u2022\nour ability to expand our operations and the amount and timing of expenditures related to expansion of our operations, particularly outside the U.S.; and\n\u2022\neconomic assumptions and market factors used to determine post-retirement benefits and pension liabilities.\nVarious provisions and laws could delay or prevent a change of control.\nThe anti-takeover provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws and provisions of North Carolina law could delay or prevent a change of control or may impede the ability of the holders of our common stock to change our management. In particular, our articles of incorporation and bylaws, among other things:\n\u2022\nrequire a supermajority shareholder vote to approve any business combination transaction with an owner of 5% or more of our shares unless the transaction is recommended by disinterested directors;\n\u2022\nlimit the right of shareholders to remove directors and fill vacancies;\n\u2022\nregulate how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholders\u2019 meetings; and\n\u2022\nauthorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock in one or more series, without shareholder approval.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could lower the market price for our common stock.\nIn the future, we may sell additional shares of our common stock to raise capital. In addition, a reasonable number of shares of our common stock are reserved for issuance under our equity compensation plans, including shares to be issued upon the exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted stock or unit grants. We cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect, if any, that they may have on the market price for our common stock. The issuance and sales of substantial amounts of common stock, or the perception that such issuances and sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Capital Structure\nOur debt agreement and the indenture governing our senior notes impose limitations on our operations, which could impede our ability to respond to market conditions, address unanticipated capital investments and/or pursue business opportunities.\nThe agreement governing our senior secured revolving credit facility and the indenture governing the senior notes impose limitations on our operations, such as limitations on certain restricted payments, investments, incurrence or repayment of indebtedness, and maintenance of a consolidated net leverage ratio and an interest coverage financial ratio. In addition, the indenture governing our senior notes contains limitations on certain restricted payments, investments and incurrence or repayment of indebtedness. These limitations could impede our ability to respond to market conditions, address unanticipated capital investment needs and/or pursue business opportunities.\nWe may not have sufficient cash to fund a required repurchase the senior notes upon a change of control.\nUpon a change of control, as defined under the indenture governing the senior notes and includes events that may be beyond our control, the holders of the senior notes have the right to require us to offer to purchase all of the senior notes then outstanding at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. In order to obtain sufficient funds to pay the purchase price of the outstanding notes, we expect that we would have to refinance the senior notes. We cannot assure you that we would be able to refinance the senior notes on reasonable terms, if at all. Our failure to offer to purchase all outstanding notes or to purchase all validly tendered notes would be an event of default under the indenture governing the senior notes. Such an event of default may cause the acceleration of our other debt.", "PERMNO": 89406, "SIC": 3050, "TIC": "NPO"}
