{"cik": "1037390", "company": "GRIFFIN INDUSTRIAL REALTY, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-10", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nGriffin\u2019s real estate business has a number of risk factors. The risk factors discussed below are those that management deems to be material, but they may not be the only risks facing Griffin. Additional risks not currently known or currently deemed not to be material may also impact Griffin. If any of the following risks occur, Griffin\u2019s\nbusiness, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected. Investors should also refer to Griffin\u2019s quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for any material updates to these risk factors.\nAdverse Economic Conditions and Credit Markets\nGriffin\u2019s real estate business may be affected by market conditions and economic challenges experienced by the U.S. economy as a whole, conditions in the credit markets or by local economic conditions in the markets in which its properties are located. Such conditions may impact Griffin\u2019s results of operations, financial condition or ability to expand its operations as a result of the following:\n\u00b7\nThe financial condition of Griffin\u2019s tenants may be adversely affected, which may result in tenant defaults under leases due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failures or for other reasons;\n\u00b7\nA decrease in investment spending, the curtailment of expansion plans or significant job losses may decrease demand for Griffin\u2019s industrial/warehouse and office/flex space, causing market rental rates and property values to be negatively impacted;\n\u00b7\nGriffin\u2019s ability to borrow on terms and conditions that it finds acceptable, or at all, may be limited, which could reduce its ability to pursue acquisition and development opportunities, refinance existing debt, and/or increase future interest expense;\n\u00b7\nReduced values of Griffin\u2019s properties may limit its ability to obtain debt financing collateralized by its properties or may limit the proceeds from such potential financings;\n\u00b7\nA weak economy may limit sales of land intended for commercial/industrial use;\n\u00b7\nChanges in supply or demand for similar or competing properties in an area may adversely affect Griffin\u2019s competitive position; and\n\u00b7\nLong periods of time may elapse between the commencement and the completion of Griffin\u2019s projects.\nDownturn in the Residential Real Estate Market\nWeakness in the residential real estate market may adversely affect Griffin\u2019s residential real estate development activities, including lowering selling prices and/or delaying the development and/or sale of Griffin\u2019s undeveloped land intended for residential use.\nRisks Associated with Concentration of Real Estate Holdings\nGriffin\u2019s real estate holdings are concentrated in the Hartford, Connecticut area and the Lehigh Valley of Pennsylvania. Adverse changes in the local economies, state or local governmental regulations or real estate markets, including the market\u2019s ability to absorb newly constructed space, could impact Griffin\u2019s real estate operations, including Griffin\u2019s ability to re-lease vacant space and have an adverse effect on rental rates.\nGriffin\u2019s real estate properties compete with other properties in the areas where it operates. The construction of new facilities by competitors would increase capacity in the marketplace, and an increase in the amount of vacancies in competitors\u2019 properties and negative absorption of space could result in Griffin experiencing longer times to lease vacant space, eroding lease rates or hindering renewals by existing tenants.\nAdditionally, real estate properties are not as liquid as other types of investments and this lack of liquidity could limit Griffin\u2019s ability to react promptly to changes in economic, financial, investment or other conditions.\nRisks Associated with Entering New Real Estate Markets\nGriffin expects to continue to seek to acquire properties either in the Lehigh Valley or other markets outside of the Hartford, Connecticut area. Operating in a real estate market that is new for Griffin creates additional risks and uncertainties to Griffin\u2019s operations.\nCompetition with Other Parties for Property Investments\nThere is a great amount of competition for the acquisition of industrial/warehouse buildings and for the acquisition of undeveloped land for construction of such buildings. Griffin competes for the acquisition of industrial/warehouse properties with REITs and institutional investors, such as pension funds, private real estate investment funds, insurance company investment accounts, public and private investment companies, individuals and other entities engaged in real estate investment activities. Some of these competitors have greater financial resources than Griffin, and may be able to accept more risk, including risk related to the creditworthiness of tenants or the degree of leverage they may be willing to take on. Competitors for acquisitions may also have advantages from a lower cost of capital or greater operating efficiencies associated with being a larger entity.\nRisks Associated with the Use of Third Party Managers for Day-to-Day Property Management\nGriffin currently utilizes a local third party manager for the day-to-day management of its Lehigh Valley properties. To the extent that Griffin uses a third party manager, the cash flows from its Lehigh Valley properties may be adversely affected if the property manager fails to provide quality services. Additionally, the third party manager manages and owns other properties that may compete with Griffin\u2019s properties, which may result in conflicts of interest and decisions regarding the operation of Griffin\u2019s properties that are not in Griffin\u2019s best interests.\nRisks Relating to Reliance on Lease Revenue\nThe substantial majority of Griffin\u2019s revenue is derived from lease revenue from its industrial/warehouse and office/flex buildings. Griffin\u2019s revenue would be adversely affected if a significant number of Griffin\u2019s tenants were unable to meet their obligations to Griffin or if Griffin were unable to lease a significant amount of space in its properties on economically favorable lease terms. In addition, there can be no assurance that any tenant whose lease expires in the future will renew such lease or that Griffin will be able to re-lease space on economically favorable terms. Griffin\u2019s inability to re-lease space on economically favorable terms could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Associated with Nonrecourse Mortgage Loans\nAs of November 30, 2016, Griffin had indebtedness under nonrecourse mortgage loans of approximately $111.1 million, collateralized by approximately 82% of the total square footage of its industrial/warehouse and office/flex buildings. If a significant number of Griffin\u2019s tenants were unable to meet their obligations to Griffin or if Griffin were unable to lease a significant amount of space in its properties on economically favorable lease terms, there would be a risk that Griffin would not have sufficient cash flow from operations for payments of required principal and interest on these loans. If Griffin were unable to make such payments and were to default, the property collateralizing the mortgage loan could be foreclosed upon, and Griffin\u2019s financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. In addition, two of Griffin\u2019s nonrecourse mortgage loans contain cross default provisions. A default under a mortgage loan that has cross default provisions may cause Griffin to automatically default on another loan.\nRisks Associated with Financing Arrangements that Include Balloon Payment Obligations\nCertain of Griffin\u2019s nonrecourse mortgage loans require a lump-sum or \u201cballoon\u201d payment at maturity. Griffin\u2019s ability to make a balloon payment at maturity may be uncertain and may depend upon its ability to obtain additional financing. At the time the balloon payment is due, Griffin may or may not be able to refinance the balloon payment on terms as favorable as the original mortgage terms.\nRisks Associated with Failure to Effectively Hedge Against Interest Rate Fluctuation\nGriffin has entered into several interest rate swap agreements to hedge its interest rate exposures related to its variable rate nonrecourse mortgages on certain of its industrial/warehouse and office/flex buildings. These agreements have costs and involve the risks that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing Griffin\u2019s exposure to interest rate fluctuations and that a court could rule that such agreements are not legally enforceable. The failure to hedge effectively against interest rate fluctuations may materially and adversely affect Griffin\u2019s results of operations. Additionally, any settlement charges incurred to terminate an interest rate swap agreement may result in increased interest expense, which may also have an adverse effect on Griffin\u2019s results of operations.\nRisks Associated with Volatility in the Capital and Credit Markets\nVolatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets could make it more difficult to borrow money. Market volatility could hinder Griffin\u2019s ability to obtain new debt financing or refinance maturing debt on favorable terms, or at all. Any financing or refinancing issues could materially and adversely affect Griffin. Market turmoil and the tightening of credit can lead to an increased lack of consumer confidence and widespread reduction of business activity in general, which also could materially and adversely impact Griffin, including its ability to acquire and dispose of assets on favorable terms, or at all.\nRisks Associated with Increased Operating Expenses\nOperating expenses such as real estate taxes, fuel, utilities, labor, repairs and maintenance, building materials and insurance, are not fixed and may increase in the future. Griffin may not be able to pass these costs on to its tenants and, therefore, any such increases could have an adverse effect on Griffin\u2019s results of operations and cash flow.\nPotential Environmental Liabilities\nGriffin has extensive land holdings in Connecticut and Massachusetts and in fiscal 2010 started acquiring properties in the Lehigh Valley of Pennsylvania. Under federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, Griffin may be required to investigate and clean up the effects of releases of hazardous substances or petroleum products at its properties because of its current or past ownership or operation of the real estate. If previously unidentified environmental problems arise, Griffin may have to make substantial payments, which could adversely affect its cash flow. As an owner or operator of properties, Griffin may have to pay for property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred in connection with a contamination. The law typically imposes cleanup responsibility and liability regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the contamination. Changes in environmental regulations may impact the development potential of Griffin\u2019s undeveloped land or could increase operating costs due to the cost of complying with new regulations.\nGovernmental Regulations\nGriffin\u2019s operations are subject to governmental regulations that affect real estate development, such as local zoning ordinances. Any changes in such regulations may impact the ability of Griffin to develop its properties or increase Griffin\u2019s costs of development. Subdivision and other residential development may also be affected by the potential adoption of initiatives meant to limit or concentrate residential growth. Commercial and industrial development activities of Griffin\u2019s undeveloped land may also be affected by traffic considerations, potential environmental issues, community opposition and other restrictions to development imposed by governmental agencies.\nInsurance Coverage Does Not Include All Potential Losses in the Real Estate Business\nGriffin carries comprehensive insurance coverage, including property, fire, terrorism and loss of rental revenue. The insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits. However, there are certain losses that are not generally insured against or that are not fully insured against. If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs with respect to one or more of Griffin\u2019s properties, Griffin could experience a significant loss of capital invested and potential revenue from the properties affected.\nRisks Associated with the Cost of Raw Materials and Energy Costs\nGriffin\u2019s construction activities and maintenance of its current portfolio could be adversely affected by increases in raw materials or energy costs. As petroleum and other energy costs increase, products used in the construction of Griffin\u2019s facilities, such as steel, masonry, asphalt, cement and building products may increase. An increase in the cost of building new facilities could negatively impact Griffin\u2019s future operating results through increased depreciation expense. An increase in construction costs would also require increased investment in Griffin\u2019s real estate assets, which may lower the return on investment in new facilities. An increase in energy costs could increase Griffin\u2019s building operating expenses and thereby lower Griffin\u2019s operating results.\nInvestment in a Foreign Company\nGriffin has an investment in Centaur Media plc, a public company based in the United Kingdom. The ultimate liquidation of that investment and conversion of proceeds into United States currency is subject to future foreign currency exchange rates.\nRisks Associated with Deficiencies in Disclosure Controls and Procedures or Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nGriffin\u2019s design and effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent all errors, misstatements or misrepresentations. While Griffin continues to review the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting, there can be no guarantee that its internal controls over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time. Deficiencies, including any material weakness or significant deficiency, in its internal controls over financial reporting which may occur in the future could result in misstatements of Griffin\u2019s results of operations, restatements of its financial statements and a decline in its stock price, or otherwise materially adversely affect Griffin\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nRisks Associated with Information Technology (\u201cIT\u201d) Security Breaches\nAs part of Griffin\u2019s normal business activities, it uses information technology and other computer resources to carry out important operational activities and to maintain its business records. Griffin\u2019s computer systems, including its backup systems, are subject to interruption or damage from power outages, computers and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches (including through cyber-attack and data theft), usage errors and catastrophic events, such as fires, floods, tornadoes and hurricanes. If Griffin\u2019s computer systems and its backup systems are compromised, degraded, damaged or breached, or otherwise cease to function properly, Griffin could suffer interruptions in its operations or unintentionally allow misappropriation of proprietary or confidential information, which could damage its reputation and require Griffin to incur significant costs to remediate or otherwise resolve these issues. Although Griffin makes efforts to maintain the security and integrity of its IT networks and related systems, there can be no assurance that the security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging.\nGriffin is Subject to Litigation That May Adversely Impact Operating Results\nGriffin is, and may in the future be, a party to a number of legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business which could become significant. Given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, Griffin can offer no assurance that a future adverse development related to existing litigation or any future litigation will not have a material adverse impact on its business, consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe Concentrated Ownership of Griffin Common Stock by Members of the Cullman and Ernst Families\nMembers of the Cullman and Ernst families (the \u201cCullman and Ernst Group\u201d), which include Frederick M. Danziger, Griffin\u2019s Executive Chairman, Michael S. Gamzon, a director and Griffin\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer and Edgar M. Cullman, Jr., a director of Griffin, members of their families and trusts for their benefit, partnerships in which they own substantial interests and charitable foundations on whose boards of directors they sit, owned, directly or indirectly, approximately 46.2% of the outstanding common stock of Griffin as of November 30, 2016. There is an informal understanding that the persons and entities included in the Cullman and Ernst Group will vote together the shares owned by each of them. As a result, the Cullman and Ernst Group may effectively control the determination of Griffin\u2019s corporate and management policies and may limit other Griffin stockholders\u2019 ability to influence Griffin\u2019s corporate and management policies.", "PERMNO": 85982, "SIC": 6512, "TIC": "GRIF"}
