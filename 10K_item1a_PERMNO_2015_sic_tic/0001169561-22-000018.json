{"cik": "1169561", "company": "COMMVAULT SYSTEMS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-05-06", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should consider each of the following factors as well as the other information in this Annual Report in evaluating our business and our prospects. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business and financial results could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline. You should also refer to the other information set forth in this Annual Report, including our financial statements and the related notes.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have engaged, and may continue to engage, in strategic acquisitions or transactions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nAcquisitions involve a number of risks, including diversion of management\u2019s attention, ability to finance the acquisition on attractive terms, failure to retain key personnel or valuable customers, legal liabilities, the need to amortize acquired intangible assets, and intellectual property ownership and infringement risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Any additional future acquisitions may also result in the incurrence of indebtedness or the issuance of additional equity securities.\nWe could also experience financial or other setbacks if transactions encounter unanticipated problems, including problems related to execution, integration or underperformance relative to prior expectations. Acquisitions may not result in long-term benefits to us or we may not be able to further develop the acquired business in the manner we anticipated.\nFollowing the completion of acquisitions, we may have to rely on the seller to provide administrative and other support, including financial reporting and internal controls, and other transition services to the acquired business for a period of time. There can be no assurance that the seller will do so in a manner that is acceptable to us.\nOur industry is intensely competitive, and many of our competitors have greater financial, technical and sales and marketing resources and larger installed customer bases, which could enable them to compete more effectively than we do.\nThe data and information management software market is intensely competitive, highly fragmented and characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving standards, changing customer requirements and frequent new product introductions. Competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services offered.\nThe principal competitive factors in our industry include product functionality and integration, platform coverage, ability to scale, price, worldwide sales infrastructure, global technical support, name recognition and reputation. If we are unable to address these factors, our competitive position could weaken and we could experience a decline in revenues that could adversely affect our business.\nIt is also costly and time-consuming to change data and information management systems. Most of our new customers have installed data and information management systems, which gives an incumbent competitor an advantage in retaining a customer because it already understands the network infrastructure, user demands and information technology needs of the customer, and also because some customers are reluctant to invest the time and money necessary to change vendors.\nNew competitors entering our markets can have a negative impact on our competitive positioning. In addition, we expect to encounter new competitors as we enter new markets. Furthermore, many of our existing competitors are broadening their operating systems platform coverage. We also expect increased competition from OEMs, including those we partner with, and from systems and network management companies, especially those that have historically focused on the mainframe computer market and have been making acquisitions and broadening their efforts to include data management and products. We expect that competition will increase as a result of future industry consolidation. Increased competition could harm our business by causing, among other things, price reductions of our products, reduced profitability and loss of market share.\nWe rely on indirect sales channels, such as value-added resellers, systems integrators, corporate resellers, distributors, and OEMs, for the distribution of our solutions, and the failure of these channels to effectively sell our solutions could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.\nWe rely significantly on our value-added resellers, systems integrators and corporate resellers, which we collectively refer to as resellers, for the marketing and distribution of our software applications and services. Resellers are our most significant distribution channel. However, our agreements with resellers are generally not exclusive, are generally renewable annually, typically do not contain minimum sales requirements and in many cases may be terminated by either party without cause. Many of our resellers carry data management solutions that compete with ours. These resellers may give a higher priority to other software applications, including those of our competitors, or may not continue to carry data management solutions. If a number of resellers were to discontinue or reduce the sales of our products, or were to promote our competitors\u2019 products in lieu of our own, it could have a material adverse effect on our future revenues. Events or occurrences of this nature could seriously harm our sales and results of operations. If we fail to manage our resellers successfully, there may be conflicts between resellers or they could fail to perform as we anticipate, including required compliance with the terms and obligations of our agreement, either of which could reduce our sales or impact our reputation in the market. In addition, we expect that a portion of our sales growth will depend upon our ability to identify and attract new resellers. Our competitors also use reseller arrangements and may be more successful in attracting reseller partners and could enter into exclusive relationships with resellers that make it difficult to expand our reseller network. Any failure on our part to maintain and/or expand our network of resellers could impair our ability to grow revenues in the future.\nSome of our resellers may, either independently or jointly with our competitors, develop and market solutions that compete with our offerings. If this were to occur, these resellers might discontinue marketing and distributing our solutions. In addition, these resellers would have an advantage over us when marketing their competing products and related services because of their existing customer relationships. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.\nIn addition, we have a distribution agreement covering our North American commercial markets and our U.S. Federal Government market with Arrow. Pursuant to this distribution agreement, Arrow\u2019s primary role is to enable a more efficient and effective distribution channel for our products and services by managing our resellers and leveraging their industry experience. Arrow accounted for approximately 37% of our total revenues for fiscal 2022 and 36% of our total revenues for fiscal 2021. If Arrow was to discontinue or reduce the sales of our solutions or if our agreement with Arrow was terminated, and if we were unable to take back the management of our reseller channel or find another North American distributor to replace Arrow, then it could have a material adverse effect on our future revenues.\nOur OEMs sell and integrate our solutions which represents a material portion of our revenues. We have no control over the shipping dates or volumes of systems these OEMs sell and they have no obligation to sell systems incorporating our solutions. They also have no obligation to recommend or offer our solutions exclusively or at all. They have no minimum sales requirements and can terminate our relationship at any time. These OEMs also could choose to develop their own data management solutions. Our OEM partners compete with one another. If one of our OEM partners views our arrangement with another OEM as competing, it may decide to stop doing business with us. Any material decrease in the volume of sales generated by OEMs could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations in future periods.\nIf the cost for maintenance and support agreements, or our term-based subscription licenses, with our customers is not competitive in the market or if our customers do not renew their agreements either at all, or on terms that are less favorable to us, our business and financial performance might be adversely impacted.\nMost of our support and maintenance agreements are for a one-year term and thereafter, we pursue renewal thereof. Historically, such renewals have represented a significant portion of our total revenue. If our customers do not renew their annual maintenance and support agreements or transition to other products or services, either at all, or on terms that are less favorable to us, our business and financial performance might be adversely impacted.\nAdditionally, a significant amount of our revenues are from term-based, or subscription license arrangements. The arrangements are typically one to three years in duration. If at the end of the initial term, customers elect to not renew, or they renew terms that are less favorable to us, our business and financial performance might be adversely impacted.\nIn periods of volatile economic conditions, our exposure to credit risk and payment delinquencies on our accounts receivable significantly increases.\nOur outstanding accounts receivables are generally not secured. Our standard terms and conditions permit payment within a specified number of days following the receipt of our solution. Volatile economic conditions, including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic and its variants, or the war in Ukraine and the global response, could result in our customers and resellers facing liquidity concerns leading to them not being able to satisfy their payment obligations to us, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nIn addition, we have transitioned a more significant percentage of our revenue to subscription, or term based, arrangements. In these arrangements, our customers may pay for solutions over a period of several years. Due to the potential for extended period of collection, we may be exposed to more significant credit risk.\nActual or threatened public health crises could adversely affect our business in a material way.\nAs a global company, with employees and customers located around the world in a variety of industries, our performance may be impacted by public health crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused global economic uncertainty. The emergence of a public health threat could pose the risk that our employees, partners, and clients may be prevented from conducting business activities at full capacity for an indefinite period, due to the spread of the disease or suggested or mandated by governmental authorities. Moreover, these conditions can affect the rate of information technology spending and may adversely affect our clients\u2019 willingness to purchase our solutions, delay prospective clients\u2019 purchasing decisions, reduce the value or duration of their contracts, cause our clients to request concessions including extended payment terms or better pricing, or affect attrition rates, all of which could adversely affect our future sales and operating results. The global spread of COVID-19 has created significant uncertainty, and economic disruption. We have undertaken measures to protect our employees, partners, and clients, including allowing our employees to work remotely; however, there can be no assurance that these measures will be sufficient or that we can implement them without adversely affecting our business operations.\nWe develop solutions that interoperate with certain products, operating systems and hardware developed by others, and if the developers of those operating systems and hardware do not cooperate with us or we are unable to devote the necessary resources so that our solutions interoperate with those systems, our development efforts may be delayed or foreclosed and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur solutions operate primarily on the Windows, UNIX, Linux and Novell Netware operating systems; used in conjunction with Microsoft SQL; and on hardware devices of numerous manufacturers. When new or updated versions of these operating systems, solution applications, and hardware devices are introduced, it is often necessary for us to develop updated versions of our solution applications so that they interoperate properly with these systems and devices. We may not accomplish these development efforts quickly or cost-effectively, and it is not clear what the relative growth rates of these operating systems and hardware will be.\nWe sell a backup appliance which integrates our solution with hardware. If we fail to accurately predict manufacturing requirements and manage our supply chain we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays that could harm our business.\nWe generally provide forecasts of our requirements to our supply chain partners on a rolling basis. If our forecast exceeds our actual requirements, a supply chain partner may assess additional charges or we may incur costs for excess inventory they hold, each of which could negatively affect our gross margins. If our forecast is less than our actual requirements, the applicable supply chain partner may have insufficient time or components to produce or fulfill our solutions' requirements, which could delay or interrupt manufacturing of our products or fulfillment of orders for our solutions, and result in delays in shipments, customer dissatisfaction, and deferral or loss of revenue. If we fail to accurately predict our requirements, we may be unable to fulfill those orders or we may be required to record charges for excess inventory. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe encounter long sales and implementation cycles, particularly for our larger customers, which could have an adverse effect on the size, timing and predictability of our revenues.\nPotential or existing customers, particularly larger enterprise customers, generally commit significant resources to an evaluation of available solutions and require us to expend substantial time, effort and money educating them as to the value of our solutions. Sales often require an extensive education and marketing effort.\nWe could expend significant funds and resources during a sales cycle and ultimately fail to win the customer. Our sales cycle for all of our products and services is subject to significant risks and delays over which we have little or no control, including:\n\u2022our customers\u2019 budgetary constraints;\n\u2022the timing of our customers\u2019 budget cycles and approval processes;\n\u2022our customers\u2019 willingness to replace their current software solutions;\n\u2022our need to educate potential customers about the uses and benefits of our solutions; and\n\u2022the timing of the expiration of our customers\u2019 current agreements for similar solutions.\nIf our sales cycles lengthen unexpectedly, they could adversely affect the timing of our revenues or increase costs, which may cause fluctuations in our quarterly revenues and results of operations. Finally, if we are unsuccessful in closing sales of our solutions after spending significant funds and management resources, our operating margins and results of operations could be adversely impacted, and the price of our common stock could decline.\nWe depend on growth in the data management solutions market, and lack of growth or contraction in this market could have a material adverse effect on our sales and financial condition.\nDemand for data management solutions is linked to growth in the amount of data generated and stored, demand for data retention and management (whether as a result of regulatory requirements or otherwise) and demand for and adoption of new backup devices and networking technologies. Because our solutions are concentrated within the data management market, if the demand for backup and data management solutions devices declines, our sales, profitability and financial condition would be materially adversely affected.\nFurthermore, the data management solutions market is dynamic and evolving. Our future financial performance will depend in large part on continued growth in the number of organizations adopting data management solutions for their environments. The market for data management solutions may not continue to grow at historic rates, or at all. If this market fails to grow or grows more slowly than we currently anticipate, our sales and profitability could be adversely affected.\nOur complex solutions may contain undetected errors, which could adversely affect not only their performance but also our reputation and the acceptance of our solutions in the market.\nOur complex solutions may contain undetected errors or failures, especially when they are made generally available or new versions are released. Despite extensive testing by us and customers, we have discovered errors in our solutions in the past and will do so in the future. As a result of past discovered errors, we experienced delays and lost revenues while we corrected those solutions. In addition, customers in the past have brought to our attention \u201cbugs\u201d in our software created by the customers\u2019 unique operating environments, which are often characterized by a wide variety of both standard and non-standard configurations that make pre-release testing very difficult and time consuming. Although we have been able to fix these bugs in the past, we may not always be able to do so. Our solutions may also be subject to intentional attacks by viruses that seek to take advantage of these bugs, errors or other weaknesses. Any of these events may result in the loss of, or delay in, market acceptance of our solutions or damage to our reputation, which would seriously harm our sales, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not receive significant revenues from our current research and development efforts for several years, if at all.\nDeveloping software is expensive, and the investment in product development may involve a long payback cycle. Our research and development expenses were $153.6 million, or 20% of our total revenues in fiscal 2022, $133.4 million, or 18% of our total revenues in fiscal 2021 and $110.0 million, or 16% of our total revenues in fiscal 2020. We believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position. However, we may not recognize significant revenues from these investments for several years, if at all.\nOur ability to sell our solutions is highly dependent on the quality of our customer support and professional services, and failure to offer high quality customer support and professional services would have a material adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.\nOur services include the assessment and design of solutions to meet our customers\u2019 storage management requirements and the efficient installation and deployment of our software applications based on specified business objectives. Further, once our software applications are deployed, our customers depend on us to resolve issues relating to our software applications. A high level of service is critical for the successful marketing and sale of our software. If we or our partners do not effectively install or deploy our applications, or succeed in helping our customers quickly resolve post-deployment issues, it would adversely affect our ability to sell software products to existing customers and could harm our reputation with prospective customers. As a result, our failure to maintain high quality support and professional services would have a material adverse effect on our sales of software applications and results of operations.\nA portion of our revenue is generated by sales to government entities, which are subject to a number of challenges and risks.\nSales to U.S. and foreign federal, state, and local governmental agencies account for a portion of our revenue, and we may in the future increase sales to government entities. This customer base experiences budgetary constraints or shifts in spending priorities regularly which may adversely affect sales of our solutions to government entities.\nSelling to government entities can be highly competitive, expensive and time consuming, often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that we will successfully sell our solutions. Government entities may require contract terms that differ from our standard terms and conditions including termination rights favorable for the customer, audit rights, and maintenance of certain security clearances for facilities and employees which can entail administrative time and effort resulting in costs and delays. Government demand for our solutions may be more volatile as they are affected by public sector budgetary cycles, funding authorizations, and the potential for funding reductions or delays, making the time to close such transactions more difficult to predict.\nWe are subject to several local, state, federal and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy and data protection.\nIn the event of a security breach, these laws may subject us to incident response, notice and remediation costs. Failure to safeguard data adequately or to destroy data securely could subject us to regulatory investigations or enforcement actions under applicable data security, unfair practices or consumer protection laws which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. The scope and interpretation of these laws could change and the associated burdens and our compliance costs could increase in the future.\nChange in senior management or key personnel could cause disruption in the Company and have a material effect on our business.\nWe have had, and could have, changes in senior management which could be disruptive to management and operations of the Company and could have a material effect on our business, operating results and financial conditions. Turnover at the senior management level may create instability within the Company, which could impede the Company\u2019s day-to-day operations. Such instability could impede our ability to fully implement our business plan and growth strategy, which would harm our business and prospects.\nWe rely on our key personnel to execute our existing business operations and identify and pursue new growth opportunities. The loss of key employees could result in significant disruptions to our business, and the\nintegration and training of replacement personnel could be costly, time consuming, cause additional disruptions to our business and be unsuccessful.\nBorrowing against our revolving credit facility could adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nWe have a $100 million revolving credit facility. If we were to borrow substantially against this facility the indebtedness could have adverse consequences, including:\n\u2022requiring us to devote a portion of our cash flow from operations to payments of indebtedness, which would reduce the availability of cash flow to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures and other general purposes;\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, general adverse economic conditions or changes in our business and the industry in which we operate in;\n\u2022placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u2022limiting our ability to fund potential acquisitions.\nRisks Related to our International Operations\nVolatility in the global economy could adversely impact our continued growth, results of operations and our ability to forecast future business.\nAs a global company, we have become increasingly subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in domestic and global economic and political conditions. Uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment and associated global economic conditions have resulted in volatility in credit, equity, debt and foreign currency markets.\nThese global economic conditions can result in slower economic activity, decreased consumer confidence, reduced corporate profits and capital spending, inflation, adverse business conditions and liquidity concerns. There has also been increased volatility in foreign exchange markets. These factors make it difficult for our customers, our vendors and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. These factors could cause customers to slow or defer spending on our solutions, which would delay and lengthen sales cycles and negatively affect our results of operations. If such conditions deteriorate or if the pace of economic recovery is slower or more uneven, our results of operations could be adversely affected, we may not be able to sustain the growth rates we have experienced recently, and we could fail to meet the expectations of stock analysts and investors, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nWe continue to invest in our business internationally where there may be significant risks with overseas investments and growth prospects. Increased volatility or declines in the credit, equity, debt and foreign currency markets in these regions could cause delays in or cancellations of orders. Deterioration of economic conditions in the countries in which we do business could also cause slower or impaired collections on accounts receivable.\nOur international sales and operations are subject to factors that could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe have significant sales and services operations outside the United States and derive a substantial portion of our revenues from these operations. We also plan to continue to expand our international operations. We generated approximately 48% of our revenues from outside the United States in both fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021. International revenue increased 8% in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. Expansion of our international operations will require a significant amount of attention from our management and substantial financial resources and might require us to add qualified management in these markets.\nIn addition to facing risks similar to the risks faced by our domestic operations, our international operations are also subject to risks related to the differing legal, political, social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many countries, including:\n\u2022adverse effects in economic conditions in the countries in which we operate related specifically to the COVID-19 pandemic and the governmental regulations put in place as a result of the virus, and the war in Ukraine;\n\u2022difficulties in staffing and managing our international operations;\n\u2022foreign countries may impose additional withholding taxes or otherwise tax our foreign income, impose tariffs or adopt other restrictions on foreign trade or investment, including currency exchange controls;\n\u2022difficulties in coordinating the activities of our geographically dispersed and culturally diverse operations;\n\u2022general economic conditions in the countries in which we operate, including seasonal reductions in business activity in the summer months in Europe and in other periods in other countries, could have an adverse effect on our earnings from operations in those countries;\n\u2022imposition of, or unexpected adverse changes in, foreign laws or regulatory requirements may occur, including those pertaining to sanctions, export restrictions, privacy and data protection, trade and employment restrictions and intellectual property protections;\n\u2022longer payment cycles for sales in foreign countries and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u2022competition from local suppliers;\n\u2022greater risk of a failure of our employees and partners to comply with both U.S. and foreign laws, including antitrust regulations, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, and any trade regulations ensuring fair trade practices;\n\u2022costs and delays associated with developing solutions in multiple languages; and\n\u2022political unrest, war or acts of terrorism.\nOur business in emerging markets requires us to respond to rapid changes in market conditions in those markets. Our overall success in international markets depends, in part, upon our ability to succeed in differing legal, regulatory, economic, social and political conditions. We may not continue to succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies that will be effective in each location where we do business. The occurrence of any of the foregoing factors may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe may experience fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that could adversely impact our results of operations.\nOur international sales are generally denominated in foreign currencies, and this revenue could be materially affected by currency fluctuations. Our primary exposure is to fluctuations in exchange rates for the U.S. dollar versus the Euro and, to a lesser extent, the Australian dollar, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan, Indian rupee, Korean won and Singapore dollar. Changes in currency exchange rates could adversely affect our reported revenues and could require us to reduce our prices to remain competitive in foreign markets, which could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. An unfavorable change in the exchange rate of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar would result in lower revenues when translated into U.S. dollars, although operating expenditures would be lower as well.\nIn recent fiscal years, we have selectively hedged our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the balance sheet. In the future, we may enter into additional foreign currency-based hedging contracts to reduce our exposure to significant fluctuations in currency exchange rates on the balance sheet, although there can be no assurances that we will do so. However, as our international operations grow, or if dramatic fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates continue or increase or if our hedging strategies become ineffective, the effect of changes in the foreign currency exchange rates could become material to revenue, operating expenses, and income.\nRisks Related to Information Technology and Security\nWe may be subject to IT system failures, network disruptions and breaches in data security.\nIT system failures, network disruptions and breaches of data security could disrupt our operations by causing delays or cancellation of customer orders, impeding the delivery of our solutions, negatively affecting customer support or professional services, preventing the processing of transactions and reporting of financial results, and disturbing our enterprise resource planning system. IT system failures, network disruptions and breaches of data security could also result in the unintentional disclosure of customer or our information as well as damage our reputation. There can be no assurance that a system failure, network disruption or data security breach will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nBad actors regularly attempt to gain unauthorized access to our IT systems, and many such attempts are increasingly sophisticated. The perception that the COVID-19 pandemic has made companies\u2019 IT systems more vulnerable has increased the already significant volume of such attempts. These attempts, which might be related to industrial, corporate or other espionage, criminal hackers or state-sponsored intrusions, include trying to covertly introduce malware or ransomware to our environments and impersonating authorized users.\nThird-party service providers that we may rely on to back up and process our confidential information may also be subject to similar threats. Such threats could result in the misappropriation, theft, misuse, disclosure, loss or destruction of the technology, intellectual property, or the proprietary, confidential or personal information, of us or our employees, customers, licensees, suppliers or partners, as well as damage to or disruptions in our IT systems. These threats are constantly evolving, increasing the difficulty of successfully defending against them or implementing adequate preventative measures. We seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but attempts to gain unauthorized access to our IT systems or other attacks may be successful, and in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects.\nRisks Related to Legal Matters\nWe have been, and may in the future become, involved in litigation that may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFrom time to time, we may become involved in various other legal proceedings relating to matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business, including intellectual property, commercial, product liability, employment, class action, whistleblower and other litigation and claims, and governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings. Such matters can be time-consuming, divert management\u2019s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. Furthermore, because litigation is inherently uncertain, there can be no assurance that the results of any of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nRisks Related to Tax and Accounting\nOur effective tax rate is difficult to project, and changes in such tax rate or adverse results of tax examinations could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Our results of operations would be adversely affected to the extent that our geographical mix of income becomes more weighted toward jurisdictions with higher tax rates and would be favorably affected to the extent the relative geographic mix shifts to lower tax jurisdictions. Any change in our mix of earnings is dependent upon many factors and is therefore difficult to predict.\nThe process of determining our anticipated tax liabilities involves many calculations and estimates that are inherently complex and make the ultimate tax obligation determination uncertain. As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate prior to the completion and filing of tax returns for such periods. These estimates involve complex issues, require extended periods of time to resolve, and require us to make judgments, such as anticipating the outcomes of audits with tax authorities and the positions that we will take on tax returns prior to our actually preparing the returns.\nFurthermore, our overall effective income tax rate and tax expenses may be affected by various factors in our business, including changes in our entity structure, geographic mix of income and expenses, tax laws, and variations in the estimated and actual level of annual profits before income tax.\nOur reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC, and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, and may even affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement or effectiveness of a change.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nCertain provisions of our certificate of formation and our amended and restated bylaws or Delaware law could prevent or delay a potential acquisition of control of our Company, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of formation, amended and restated bylaws and the laws in the State of Delaware contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the prospective acquirer and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. Delaware law also imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock.\nWe believe that these provisions protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by effectively requiring those who seek to obtain control of the Company to negotiate with our Board of Directors and by providing our Board of Directors with more time to assess any acquisition of control. However, these provisions could apply even if an acquisition of control of the Company may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition of control that our Board of Directors determines is not in the best interests of our Company and our shareholders.\nAlthough we believe we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting, we are required to assess our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis, and any future adverse results from such assessment could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price.\nManagement has assessed that our internal control over financial reporting is effective and lacks any material weaknesses. Such assessment is made through subjective judgment of our management that may be open to interpretation. The effectiveness of our internal control in the future is subject to the risk that such internal controls may become inadequate. In the future, if we fail to timely complete this assessment, or if our independent auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls, there may be a loss of public confidence financial reporting, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to regulatory sanctions or investigations by the Nasdaq Stock Market, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to timely meet our regulatory reporting obligations.\nWe may experience a decline in revenues or volatility in our quarterly operating results, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe cannot predict our future quarterly revenues or operating results with certainty because of many factors outside of our control. A significant revenue or profit decline, lowered forecasts or volatility in our operating results could cause the market price of our common stock to decline substantially. Factors that could affect our revenues and operating results include the following:\n\u2022the unpredictability of the timing and magnitude of orders for our solutions, particularly transactions greater than $100,000 in recent fiscal years, a majority of our quarterly revenues were earned and recorded near the end of each quarter;\n\u2022the possibility that our customers may cancel, defer or limit purchases as a result of reduced information technology budgets;\n\u2022the possibility that our customers may defer purchases of our solutions in anticipation of new solutions or updates from us or our competitors;\n\u2022the ability of our OEMs and resellers to meet their sales objectives;\n\u2022market acceptance of our new solutions and enhancements;\n\u2022our ability to control expenses;\n\u2022changes in our pricing, packaging and distribution terms or those of our competitors; and\n\u2022the demands on our management, sales force and customer services infrastructure as a result of the introduction of new solutions or updates.\nOur expense levels are relatively fixed and are based, in part, on our expectations of future revenues. If revenue levels fall below our expectations and we are profitable at the time, our net income would decrease because only a small portion of our expenses varies with our revenues. Therefore, any significant decline in revenues for any period could have an immediate adverse impact on our results of operations for that period. We believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our results of operations could be below expectations of public market analysts and investors in future periods which would likely cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nThe price of our common stock may be highly volatile and may decline regardless of our operating performance.\nThe market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to:\n\u2022variations in our quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u2022changes in financial estimates, treatment of our tax assets or liabilities or investment recommendations by securities analysts following our business or our competitors;\n\u2022the public\u2019s response to our press releases, rumors, our other public announcements and our filings with the SEC;\n\u2022changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance or interpretations or principles;\n\u2022sales of common stock by our directors, officers and significant stockholders;\n\u2022announcements of technological innovations or enhanced or new products by us or our competitors;\n\u2022our failure to achieve operating results consistent with securities analysts\u2019 projections;\n\u2022the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable to us;\n\u2022broad market and industry factors; and\n\u2022other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to such events.\nThe market prices of data management solutions companies have been extremely volatile. Stock prices of many of those companies have often fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to their operating performance. In the past, following periods of market volatility, stockholders have often instituted securities class action litigation. Securities litigation could have a substantial cost and divert resources and the attention of management from our business.\nGeneral Risks\nOur business could be materially and adversely affected as a result of natural disasters, terrorism or other catastrophic events.\nAny economic failure or other material disruption caused by war or natural disasters, including fires, floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, and tornadoes; power loss or shortages; environmental disasters; telecommunications or business information systems failures or similar events could also adversely affect our ability to conduct business. If such disruptions result in cancellations of customer orders or contribute to a general decrease in economic activity or corporate spending on IT, or impair our ability to meet our customer demands, our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business may be adversely affected by the impact of the war in Ukraine and a widespread outbreak of contagious diseases, including the COVID-19 pandemic and its variants. These events may cause us or our customers to temporarily suspend operations and could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our solutions, our ability to collect against existing trade receivables and our operating results.", "PERMNO": 91463, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "CVLT"}
