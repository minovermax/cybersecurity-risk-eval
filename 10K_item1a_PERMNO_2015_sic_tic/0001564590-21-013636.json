{"cik": "1266806", "company": "SECOND SIGHT MEDICAL PRODUCTS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Dependence on Our Commercial Products\nDespite promising results from the Early Feasibility Study for Orion being conducted at UCLA and Baylor we currently have no commercial products or product revenue and may never become profitable.\n\ufeff\nTo date, we have not generated profit from sales of our now discontinued Argus II product and will not generate revenues until we complete the development and attain the marketing approval for Orion. We have relied principally on financing from the sale of equity securities and the receipt of government and other grants to fund our operations. We expect that our future financial results will depend primarily on our success in further developing the Orion, conducting FDA approved clinical trials and obtaining clearance or approval for, launching, selling and supporting our Orion technology. To establish these operations we will need to expend significant resources on hiring additional personnel, conducting continued scientific and product research and development, engaging in further pre-clinical and clinical investigation, giving expanded attention to intellectual property development and prosecution, seeking domestic and international regulatory approvals, marketing and promotion, capital expenditures, working capital, general and administrative expenses, and fees and expenses associated with our capital raising efforts. We expect to incur costs and expenses related to consulting costs, laboratory development costs, hiring of scientists, engineers, sales representatives and other operational personnel, and the continued development of relationships with potential partners as we continue to seek regulatory clearance or approval for our products. As a pre-revenue company we continue to incur significant operating losses, and we expect to continue to incur additional losses for at least the next several years. We cannot assure you that we will generate revenue or be profitable in the future. Our future or updated Orion products may never be cleared or approved or become commercially viable or accepted for use.\nInvestment in medical device technology is highly speculative, because it entails substantial upfront capital expenditures over time and significant risk that any potential product will fail to demonstrate adequate efficacy, clinical utility or acceptance by physicians and blind individuals. Investors should evaluate an investment in us in light of the uncertainties encountered by developing medical technology companies in a competitive environment. There can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful or that we will ultimately be able to achieve profitability. Even if we achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could significantly impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business or continue to implement our business plan.\nOur commercial and financial success depends on our products being accepted in the market, and if not achieved will result in our not being able to generate revenues to support our operations.\nEven if we are able to obtain favorable reimbursement within the markets that we serve, commercial success of our products will depend, among other things, on their acceptance by retinal specialists, ophthalmologists, brain surgeons, general practitioners, low vision therapists and mobility experts, hospital purchasing and controlling departments, patients, and other members of the medical community. The degree of market acceptance of any of our product candidates will depend on factors that include:\n\u2022\ncost of treatment;\n\u2022\npricing and availability of future alternative products;\n\u2022\nthe extent of available third-party coverage or reimbursement;\n\u2022\nperceived efficacy of the Orion system relative to other future products and medical solutions; and\n\u2022\nprevalence and severity of adverse side effects associated with treatment.\nThe activities of competitive medical device companies, or others, may limit our revenue from the sale of the Orion system.\nOur commercial opportunities for the Orion system may be reduced if our competitors develop or market products that are more effective, are better tolerated, receive better reimbursement terms, achieve greater acceptance by physicians, have better distribution channels, or are less costly.\nCurrently, to our knowledge, no other medical devices comparable to the Orion system have been approved by regulatory agencies, in the U.S. or Europe, to restore some functional vision in persons who have become blind due to preventable causes. Other visual prosthesis companies such as Pixium are developing retinal implant technologies to partially restore some vision in blind patients mainly from age related macular degeneration. Pixium\u2019s initial RP prosthesis product was withdrawn from the market. A previous competitor, Retina Implant, has withdrawn from the market. Neither Retina Implant nor Pixium have filed for market approval with the FDA. To our knowledge Pixium has obtained an IDE to begin the required clinical trials in the U.S. for its PRIMA product, which is directed toward age related macular degeneration or AMD. We and Pixium are forming a business combination which we anticipate will be completed in Q2 of 2021. The Illinois Institute of Technology\u2019s Intracortical Visual Prosthesis group is currently recruiting participants for a US early feasibility study of a visual cortical prosthesis. Neuralink has recently demonstrated a cortical implant in animal models. Vision is one of Neuralink\u2019s stated goals. These and other potentially competitive therapies, if or when developed or brought to market, may result in pricing and market access pressure even if the Orion system is otherwise viewed as a preferable therapy.\nMany privately and publicly funded universities and other organizations are engaged in research and development of potentially competitive products and therapies, such as stem cell and gene therapies, some of which may target multiple indications of our product candidates. These organizations include pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, public and private universities, hospital centers, government agencies and research organizations. Our competitors include large and small medical device and biotechnology companies that may have significant access to capital resources, competitive product pipelines, substantial research and development staff and facilities, and substantial experience in medical device development.\nWe may face substantial competition in the future and may not be able to keep pace with the rapid technological changes which may result from others discovering, developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do.\nIn general, the development and commercialization of new medical devices is highly competitive and is characterized by extensive research and development and rapid technological change. Physicians and persons who may be suitable for the Orion implant likely will consider many factors including product reliability, clinical outcomes, product availability, price, and product and patient support services that we may be able to provide. Market share as it develops can shift as a result of technological innovation and other business factors. Major shifts in industry market share have occurred in connection with product problems, physician advisories and safety alerts, reflecting the importance of product quality and reliability in the medical device industry, and any quality problems with our processes, goods and services could harm our reputation for producing high-quality products and would erode our competitive advantage, sales and market share. Our competitors may develop products or other novel approaches and\ntechnologies to deal with treating blindness that are more effective, safer or less costly than any that we are developing, and if those products gain market acceptance our revenue and financial results could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to develop new products or enhance existing products, our leadership in the markets we serve could erode, and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nDespite early positive results in our limited initial trials at UCLA and Baylor School of Medicine our ongoing development efforts may never demonstrate the feasibility of our Orion technology.\n\ufeff\nOur research and development efforts remain subject to all of the risks associated with the development of new technology. Our Orion technology, though based on our FDA approved Argus II retinal prosthesis, is not yet fully developed. Development of the underlying technology, including the further development and refinement of our Orion technology, may be affected by unanticipated technical or other problems, among other development and research issues, and the possible insufficiency of funds needed in order to complete development of these products or devices. Regulatory and clinical hurdles, adverse reactions experienced in trials, or other operational or regulatory challenges also may result in delays and cause us to incur additional expenses that may increase our need for capital and result in additional losses. If we cannot complete, or if we experience significant delays in developing our technology, applications or products for use by those patients who can benefit from vision restoration, particularly after incurring significant expenditures, our business may fail and investors may lose the entirety of their investment.\nSince we have had an operating history of losses and have no current revenue producing operations, the future of our business is difficult to evaluate.\n\ufeff\nTo date, our operations on a consolidated basis have consisted of the continued development and clinical studies of our Orion-focused technologies and implementation of the early parts of our business plan. We have incurred significant operating losses in each year since our inception and we will continue to incur additional losses for the next several years. In addition, our losses may be greater than expected and our operating results may suffer. We have limited historical financial data upon which we may base our projected revenue and base our planned operating expenses. This operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our technology or prospective operations and business prospects.\nClinical development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies and initial trials may not be predictive of future trial results.\n\ufeff\nClinical testing is expensive and can take several or more years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure or delay can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. Success in nonclinical studies and early feasibility clinical studies does not ensure that expanded clinical trials that will be used to support regulatory submissions will be successful. These setbacks may be caused by, among other things, nonclinical findings made while clinical trials were underway, and safety or efficacy observations made in clinical trials, including previously unreported adverse events. Even if our clinical trials are completed, the results may not be sufficient to obtain regulatory approval or clearance for our product candidates.\n\ufeff\nInterim \u201ctop-line\u201d and preliminary results from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time may change as more patient data become available and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data.\n\ufeff\nFrom time to time, we may publish interim top-line or preliminary results from our clinical trials. Interim results from clinical trials that we may complete are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available. Preliminary or top-line results also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published. As a result, interim and preliminary data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available. Differences between preliminary or interim data and final data could significantly harm our business prospects and may cause the trading price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nWe have not been profitable to date and expect our operating losses to continue for the foreseeable future; we may never be profitable.\nWe have incurred operating losses and generated negative cash flows since our inception and have financed our operations principally through equity investments and borrowings. Our ability to generate sufficient revenues to fund operations is uncertain. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, we had net revenue of $3.4 million and incurred a net loss of $33.6 million. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, we generated no revenue from operations and incurred a net loss of $14.9 million. Our total accumulated deficit through December 31, 2020, was $319.7 million.\nAs a result of our limited commercial operating history, revenue is difficult to forecast. We expect expenses to increase in the future as we expand our activities in connection with the further development of Orion. We cannot assure you that we will be profitable in the future. Accordingly, the extent of our future losses and the time required to achieve profitability, if ever, is uncertain. Failure to achieve profitability could materially and adversely affect the value of our common stock and our ability to effect additional financings. The success of the business depends on our ability to increase revenues to offset expenses. If we do not achieve profitability, or otherwise fall short of projections, our business, financial condition and operating results will be materially adversely affected.\nOur financial statements have been prepared assuming we are a going concern.\nOur ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to obtain additional financing, obtain further operating efficiencies, reduce expenditures, attain favorable gross margins and ultimately, generate significant sales and create profitable operations. Adequate funding may not be available or may not be available on reasonable terms. Our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary materially. Our independent registered public accounting firm, in its report on our 2020 consolidated financial statements has raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern which may negatively affect the price of our common stock.\nSales, or the availability for sale, of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nWe cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of our common stock, or the availability of our common stock for future sales, will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market and the availability of shares for future sale could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock. This in turn could impair our future ability to raise capital through an offering of our equity securities.\nThere may be future sales or other dilution of our equity, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe are not restricted from issuing additional shares of common stock. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of our common stock and warrants or the perception that such sales could occur. We may issue and sell additional shares of our common stock in private placements or registered offerings in the future. We also may conduct additional registered rights offerings in the future pursuant to which we may issue shares of our common stock or other securities.\nRisks Relating to Our Operations\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse effect on our business and results of operations and is expected to continue to have further adverse effects, which could be material, on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and capital investments. \ufeff\nIn December 2019, an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) originated in Wuhan, China and has since spread globally. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. In addition, most states in the U.S., including California, where we are headquartered, have declared a state of emergency. The pandemic has resulted in government authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain\nthe virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place or stay-at-home orders, and business shutdowns.\nIn accordance with local and state guidelines regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, we are requiring all of our employees to work remotely unless they cannot perform their essential functions remotely, and have also suspended all non-essential travel for our employees. While a significant number of our employees may be accustomed to working remotely or working with other remote employees, much of our workforce has not historically been remote. Although we continue to monitor the situation and may adjust our current policies as more information and public health guidance becomes available, temporarily suspending travel and restricting the ability to do business in person may create operational or other challenges, any of which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, our clinical trials have been affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. Patient visits in ongoing clinical trials have been delayed, for example, due to prioritization of hospital resources toward the COVID-19 outbreak, travel restrictions imposed by governments, and the inability to access sites for initiation and monitoring. For example, scheduled patient visits to our clinical sites at UCLA and Baylor were temporarily put on hold due to COVID-19. Visits have now resumed at both sites. In addition, the validation study for the revised FLORA assessment was paused due to travel requirements for its completion. Also, some of our suppliers of certain materials used in the development of our product candidates are located in areas impacted by COVID-19 which could limit our ability to obtain sufficient materials for our product candidates. COVID-19 has and will continue to adversely affect global economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our product candidates, if approved, and impact our operating results. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience an adverse impact to our business as a result of the continued global economic impact of the pandemic. We could experience further harm to our business and we cannot anticipate all of the ways in which health epidemics such as COVID-19 could adversely impact our business. Although we are continuing to monitor and assess the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 outbreak or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change.\nCOVID-19 has directly and indirectly adversely affected Second Sight and will likely continue to do so for an uncertain period of time. In March and April 2020 we laid off the majority of our employees as a result of COVID-19 and an inability to obtain financing. We retain approximately twelve of our employees to oversee current operations, including some that were re-hired once our financial situation improved and the future of the company became more clear. The cumulative effects of COVID-19 on the Company cannot be predicted at this time, but could include, without limitation:\n\u2022\nreputational damages of the Company and its products;\n\u2022\ninability to raise additional funds to finance and continue our operations;\n\u2022\ninability to maintain adequate office laboratory facilities;\n\u2022\ninability to retain and hire experienced personnel;\n\u2022\ndiminished ability, or inability, to enroll patients or complete clinical trials and other activities required to achieve regulatory clearance of our products under development\n\u2022\ninability to finalize our plan for and enroll patients into our proposed pivotal clinical trial;\n\u2022\nmaterial delays or inability to complete development and commercialization of Orion;\n\u2022\ninability to satisfy Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing requirements and possible delisting; and\n\u2022\nother uncertain events that may have negative impact on our operations.\nMaterials necessary to manufacture Orion may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, which may delay development, manufacturing and commercialization of our products.\nWe rely on numerous suppliers to provide materials, components and services necessary to produce the Orion system and next generation product candidates. Certain suppliers are currently sole source because of our low manufacturing volumes and our need for specialty technical or other engineering expertise. Our suppliers may be unable or unwilling to deliver these materials and services to us timely as needed or on commercially reasonable terms. Should this occur, we would seek to qualify alternative suppliers or develop in-house manufacturing capability but may be unable to do so. Substantial design or manufacturing process modifications and regulatory approval might be required to facilitate or qualify an alternate supplier. Even where we could qualify alternative suppliers the substitution of suppliers may be at a higher cost and cause time delays including delays associated with additional possible FDA\nreview, that could impede the production of the Orion system, reduce gross profit margins and impact our ability to deliver our products as may be timely required to meet demand.\nAny failure or delay in completing clinical trials or studies for new product candidates or next generation of our products and the expense of those trials could adversely affect our business.\nPreclinical studies and clinical trials required to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of incremental changes, including new wearables and software enhancements and for new product candidates such as Orion are time consuming and expensive. If we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other studies with respect to any of our product candidates beyond those that we have contemplated, if we are unable to successfully complete our clinical trials or other studies or if the results of these trials or studies are not positive or are only modestly positive, we may be delayed in obtaining marketing approval for those product candidates, we may not be able to obtain marketing approval or we may obtain approval for indications that are not as broad as intended. Our product development costs also will increase if we experience delays in testing or approvals.\nThe completion of clinical trials for our product candidates could be delayed because of our inability to manufacture or obtain from third parties materials sufficient for use in preclinical studies and clinical trials; delays in patient enrollment and variability in the number and types of patients available for clinical trials; difficulty in maintaining contact with patients after treatment, resulting in incomplete data; poor effectiveness of product candidates during clinical trials; unforeseen safety issues or side effects; and governmental or regulatory delays and changes in regulatory requirements and guidelines.\nIf we incur significant delays in our clinical trials, our competitors may be able to bring their products to market before we do which could result in harming our ability to commercialize our products or potential products. If we experience any of these occurrences our business will be materially harmed.\nWe have lost key management and staff personnel because of Covid-19 pandemic. If we fail to recruit highly skilled personnel to replace employees who have left the Company, our ability to identify, develop and commercialize new or next generation product candidates will be impaired, could result in loss of markets or market share and could make us less competitive.\nWe have laid off the majority of our employees including key members of our executive management team because Covid-19 outbreak affected our ability to fund our operations. Our existing employees could leave our company with little or no prior notice. The loss of any management executive or any other principal member of our management team or our inability to attract and retain skilled employees could impair our ability to identify, develop and market new products or effectively deal with regulatory and reimbursement matters. Will McGuire, our President and Chief Executive Officer, tendered his resignation effective March 27, 2020 and our Board has appointed Matthew Pfeffer, a member of our Board of Directors, as acting chief executive officer, and Edward Sedo, our Controller, as Principal Accounting and Financial Officer. To the extent that we lose experienced personnel, it is critical that we develop other employees, hire new qualified personnel and successfully manage the transfer of critical knowledge. No assurance can be given that we will be able to do so.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We intend to adopt policies for compliance with these anti-bribery laws, which often carry substantial penalties. We cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from reckless or other inappropriate acts committed by our affiliates, employees or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property and Other Legal Matters\nIf we or our licensors are unable to protect our/their intellectual property, then our financial condition, results of operations and the value of our technology and products could be adversely affected.\nPatents and other proprietary rights are essential to our business, and our ability to compete effectively with other companies is dependent upon the proprietary nature of our technologies. We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive position. We seek to protect these, in part, through confidentiality agreements with certain employees, consultants and other parties. Our success will depend in part on the ability of our licensors to obtain, maintain (including making periodic filings and payments) and enforce patent protection for their intellectual property, in particular, those patents to which we have secured exclusive rights. Our licensors may not successfully prosecute or continue to prosecute the patent applications which we have licensed. Even if patents are issued in respect of these patent applications, we or our licensors may fail to maintain these patents, may determine not to pursue litigation against entities that are infringing upon these patents, or may pursue such enforcement less aggressively than we ordinarily would. Without adequate protection for the intellectual property that we own or license, other companies might be able to offer substantially identical products for sale, which could unfavorably affect our competitive business position and harm our business prospects. Two patents licensed from the John Hopkins University (the JHU Patents) expired in 2018, along with our License Agreement with the Johns Hopkins University. The expiration of the JHU Patents removes a barrier to entry for competitors who may be interested in selling a product competitive with Argus II. The JHU Patents are specific to retinal stimulation and have no effect on Orion technology.\nEven if issued, patents may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing similar products or limit the length of term of patent protection that we may have for our products.\nLitigation or third-party claims of intellectual property infringement or challenges to the validity of our patents would require us to use resources to protect our technology and may prevent or delay the development, regulatory approval or commercialization Orion system or new product candidates. Further, the validity of some of our patents has been challenged.\nPixium has three currently pending oppositions in the European Patent Office (EPO) challenging the validity of European patents owned by Second Sight. The EPO proceedings involving Pixium and Second Sight are:\n\u2022\nEP1937352 Sub-Threshold Stimulation to Precondition Neurons for Supra-Threshold Stimulation - cancelled in the Opposition Division, appeal pending.\n\u2022\nEP2061549 - Package for an Implantable Neural Stimulation Device - Cancelled in the Opposition Division, appeal pending.\n\u2022\nEP2185236 - Implantable Device for the Brain - Upheld in the Opposition Division, appeal pending.\nDue to our pending business combination, Pixium and Second Sight have agreed to withdraw those oppositions with actions due before the intended close of the business combination. We have withdrawn the one opposition we filed against Pixium. Complete withdrawal of all of the oppositions is anticipated, but dependent on completion of the business combination with Pixium.\nIf we are the target of claims by third parties asserting that our products or intellectual property infringe upon the rights of others we may be forced to incur substantial expenses or divert substantial employee resources from our business and, if successful, those claims could result in our having to pay substantial damages or prevent us from developing one or more product candidates. Further, if a patent infringement suit were brought against us or our collaborators, we or they could be forced to stop or delay research, development, manufacturing or sales of the product or product candidate that is the subject of the suit.\nThe validity of some of our patents has been challenged. If we experience patent infringement claims, or if we elect to avoid potential claims others may be able to assert, we or our collaborators may choose to seek, or be required to seek, a license from the third-party and would most likely be required to pay license fees or royalties or both. These licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we or our collaborators were able to obtain a license, the rights may be nonexclusive, which would give our competitors access to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we could be prevented from commercializing a product, or be forced to cease some aspect of our business\noperations if, as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement claims, we or our collaborators are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms. This could harm our business significantly. The cost to us of any litigation or other proceeding, regardless of its merit, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. Some of our competitors may be able to bear the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their having greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace. Intellectual property litigation and other proceedings may, regardless of their merit, also absorb significant management time and employee resources.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations in the agreements under which we license development or commercialization rights to products or technology from third parties, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.\nWe hold an exclusive license from the Doheny Eye Institute (DEI) to intellectual property relating to the Argus II visual prosthesis and Orion cortical visual prosthesis. This license imposes various commercialization, milestone payment, profit sharing, insurance and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with any material obligations, DEI will have the right to terminate the license, which covers part of the Argus and Orion systems. The existing or future patents to which we have rights based on our agreements with DEI may be too narrow to prevent third parties from developing or designing around these patents. Additionally, we may lose our exclusive rights to the patents and patent applications we license in the event of a breach or termination of the license agreement. The license expires with the expiration of the last of the licensed patents on August 8, 2033. The royalty in the agreement is 0.5% of the patented portion of Argus II system sales. All of the patents in the DEI agreement are co-owned by Second Sight and DEI. We license DEI\u2019s interest in the patents to maintain our exclusive use on that intellectual property. Should the license terminate, we retain the right to utilize the intellectual property, but may not be able to prevent others from doing so, in which case we may lose a competitive advantage.\nIf we are unable to protect the intellectual property used in our products, others may be able to copy our innovations which may impair our ability to compete effectively in our markets.\nThe strength of our patents involves complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain. We have over 300 issued patents and over 25 pending patent applications worldwide as of December 31, 2020. Our patent applications may be challenged or fail to result in issued patents and our existing or future patents may be too narrow to prevent third parties from developing or designing around our intellectual property and in that event we may lose competitive advantage and our business may suffer.\nFurther, the patent applications that we license or have filed may fail to result in issued patents. The claims may need to be amended. Even after amendment, a patent may not issue and in that event we may not obtain the exclusive use of the intellectual property that we seek and may lose competitive advantage which could result in harm to our business.\nThird-party claims of intellectual property infringement may prevent or delay our development and commercialization activities for Orion.\nAlthough we are not currently aware of any litigation or other proceedings or third-party claims of intellectual property infringement related to the Argus II or Orion systems, the medical device industry is characterized by many litigation cases regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Other parties may in the future allege that our activities infringe their patents or that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. We may not have identified all the patents, patent applications or published literature that affect our business either by blocking our ability to commercialize our product, by preventing the patentability of one or more aspects of our products or those of our licensors or by covering the same or similar technologies that may affect our ability to market our product.\nIn addition, even in the absence of litigation, we may need to obtain licenses from third parties to advance our research or allow commercialization of our product candidates, and we have done so from time to time. We may fail to obtain future licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at all. In that event, we may be unable to further develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates, which could harm our business significantly.\nWe may become involved in future lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or the patents of our licensors. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours or of our licensors is not valid or is unenforceable or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing.\nThe U.S. Patent and Trademark Office may initiate interference proceedings to determine the priority of inventions described in or otherwise affecting our patents and patent applications or those of our collaborators or licensors. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if a prevailing party does not offer us a license on terms that are acceptable to us. Litigation or interference proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distraction of our management and other employees. We may not be able to prevent, alone or with our licensors, misappropriation of our proprietary rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the U.S.\nWe are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology systems, including systems from third parties, and if we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data or if our products do not operate as intended, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology systems for our products and infrastructure, and we rely on these information technology systems, including technology from third-party vendors, to process, transmit and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations. We continuously monitor, upgrade and expand the systems we operate to improve information systems capabilities. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect, and enhance existing systems and develop or contract new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards, and the increasing need to protect patient and customer information. In addition, third parties may attempt to hack into our products or systems and may obtain data relating to patients with our products or proprietary information. If we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity with cyber security effectively, we could lose existing customers, have difficulty attracting new customers, have problems in determining product cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing, have difficulty preventing, detecting, and controlling fraud, have disputes with customers, physicians, and other health care professionals, have regulatory sanctions, fines, or penalties imposed, have increases in operating expenses, incur expenses or lose revenue as a result of a data privacy breach, or suffer other adverse consequences. There can be no assurance that our process of upgrading and expanding our information systems capabilities, protecting and enhancing our systems including cyber security methods, and developing new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology will be successful or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future. Our products contain hardware and software protections which are intended to prevent unauthorized access or control of our implanted device. However, if an unauthorized user is able to breach our controls and gain access to one of our devices implanted in a patient, serious harm, injury and/or death may result. Any significant breakdown, intrusion, interruption, corruption, or destruction of these systems, as well as any data breaches, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nProduct liability lawsuits could divert our resources, result in substantial liabilities and reduce the commercial potential of our products.\nWe face a risk of product liability claims arising from the prosthesis being inserted into the eye, and it is possible that we may be held liable for injuries of patients who receive our product. These lawsuits may divert our management from pursuing our business strategy and may be costly to defend. In addition, if we are held liable in any of these lawsuits, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be forced to limit or forego further commercialization of one or more of our products. We maintain product liability insurance relating to our clinical trials and commercial sales, with an aggregate coverage limit under these insurance policies of $10 million, and while we believe this amount of insurance currently is sufficient to cover our product liability exposure, these limits may not prove adequate to fully cover potential liabilities. In addition, we may not be able to obtain or maintain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or otherwise to protect against potential product liability claims, which could prevent or inhibit the\ncommercial production and sale of our products. If the use of our products harm or are alleged to harm people, we may be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims that exceed our policy limits and cause us significant losses that could seriously harm our financial condition or reputation.\nLegislative or regulatory reform of the health care system in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions may adversely impact our business, operations or financial results.\nOur industry is highly regulated and changes in law may adversely impact our business, operations or financial results. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and a related reconciliation bill were signed into law. This legislation changes the current system of healthcare insurance and benefits intended to broaden coverage and control costs. The law also contains provisions that will affect companies in the medical device industry and other healthcare related industries by imposing additional costs and changes to business practices.\nMoreover, in some foreign countries, including countries in Europe and Canada, the pricing of approved medical devices is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take 12 months or longer after the receipt of regulatory approval and product launch. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidate to other available therapies. Our business could be materially harmed if reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels.\nWe cannot predict what healthcare reform initiatives may be adopted in the future. Further federal and state legislative and regulatory developments appear likely, and we expect ongoing initiatives in the U.S. and Europe. These reforms could have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain timely regulatory approval for new products and on anticipated revenues from product candidates, both of which may affect our overall financial condition.\nWe are a \u201cnon-accelerated filer\u201d and a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d for SEC filing purposes and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nFor so long as we remain a \u2018non-accelerated filer\u201d we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not \u2018non-accelerated filers,\u201d including not being required to comply with the independent auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Investors may find our common stock less attractive because we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock, and our stock price may be more volatile or may decline.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that a \u201dsmaller reporting company\u201d can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. However, we chose to \u201copt out\u201d of this extended transition period, and as a result, we intend to comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates that adoption of those standards may be required. Our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.\nRisks Relating to Our Financial Results and Need for Financing\nFluctuations in our quarterly operating results and cash flows could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nThe revenues we generate and our operating results will be affected by numerous factors such as:\n\u2022\nmaterially reduced revenue we receive as a result of refocusing our business and resources to the Orion II as we discontinued the production of the Argus II systems, deemphasize our marketing and limit implants of the Argus II to finished units and inventory on hand;\n\u2022\nthe status of our preclinical and clinical development programs;\n\u2022\ncontinued clinical results from our Early Feasibility Study of six subjects currently under way at UCLA and Baylor;\n\u2022\nthe filing and acceptance of an IDE with the FDA to initiate a larger pivotal trial for regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nclinical results from conducting our larger pivotal trial(s);\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain regulatory approval of the Orion system in the U.S. and other additional jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nthe emergence of products that compete with our product candidates;\n\u2022\nour ability to leverage Argus II technology for cortical stimulation using Orion;\n\u2022\nthe status of our preclinical and clinical development programs, variations in the level of expenses related to our existing product candidates or preclinical and clinical development programs;\n\u2022\nexecution of collaborative, licensing or other arrangements, and the timing of payments received or made under those arrangements;\n\u2022\nany intellectual property infringement lawsuits to which we may become a party; and\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain reimbursement from government or private payors at levels we deem adequate to sustain our operations.\nIf our quarterly operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, or if we experience delays in reaching commercialization of the Orion system the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Any quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and cash flows may cause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially. We believe that, in the near term, quarterly comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.\nWe need additional capital to support our operations and growth. Additional capital may be difficult to obtain restricting our operations and resulting in additional dilution to our stockholders.\nOur business requires additional capital for implementation of our long term business plan. We believe our cash, cash equivalents and other investments, together with revenue generated from the current sales and cash resources, will not be sufficient to fund our operations for at least twelve months from the date of issuance of this report. We currently estimate that our existing cash and cash equivalents can sustain our operations into June 2021. The actual amount of funds that we will need for our business will be determined by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, and we may need funds sooner than currently anticipated. These factors include:\n\u2022\nthe amount of our future operating losses;\n\u2022\nlegal, accounting and other costs associated with the proposed business combination with Pixium;\n\u2022\nexpenses relating to the Early Feasibility Study of the Orion;\n\u2022\nongoing commercialization planning for the Orion system;\n\u2022\nthe amount of our research and development, including research and development for the Orion visual prosthesis, marketing and general and administrative expenses; and\n\u2022\nregulatory changes and technological developments in our markets.\nIn November 2017, we entered into an At-the-Market sales agreement (the \u201cSales Agreement\u201d) with B. Riley FBR Inc. and H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC, as agents (\u201cAgents\u201d) pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time through either of the Agents, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price as set forth in the Sales Agreement and a related prospectus supplement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We agreed to pay the Agents a cash commission of 3.0% of the aggregate gross proceeds from each sale of shares under the Sales Agreement. During January and February 2018 we sold approximately 278,000 shares of common stock for net proceeds of $4.0 million. During December 2019 we sold approximately 17,000 shares of common stock under this agreement for net proceeds of $0.1 million. During 2018 we also sold privately in at the market transactions an aggregate of approximately 1,966,000 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $22.0 million.\nIn a rights offering completed on February 22, 2019 we sold approximately 5,976,000 units, each priced at $5.792 for net cash proceeds of approximately $34.4 million. Each unit consisted of one share and one immediately exercisable warrant having an exercise price of $11.76 per share. Entities controlled by Gregg Williams, our Chairman of the Board of Directors, acquired approximately 5,180,000 units in the offering for an aggregate investment of approximately $30 million.\nIn May 2020 we entered an underwriting agreement with ThinkEquity, a division of Fordham Financial Management, Inc., pursuant to which we sold 7,500,000 shares of common stock in an underwritten public offering\nfor gross proceeds of $7.5 million. On December 8, 2020 we borrowed $1 million from Gregg Williams, Chairman of the Board of Directors and $1.2 million from two unaffiliated shareholders. This debt is unsecured, bears interest at 12% per year and together with accrued interest is due and payable on December 31, 2021.\nAs we require additional funds, we may seek to fund our operations through the sale of additional equity securities, debt financing and strategic collaboration agreements. We cannot be sure that additional financing from any of these sources will be available when needed or that, if available, the additional financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us or our stockholders. If we raise additional funds by selling shares of our capital stock, the ownership interest of our current stockholders will be diluted. If we are unable to obtain additional funds on a timely basis or on terms favorable to us, we may be required to cease or reduce certain research and development projects, to sell some or all of our technology or assets or business units or to merge all or a portion of our business with another entity. Our independent registered public accounting firm, in its reports on our 2019 and 2020 consolidated financial statements, has raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe have incurred operating losses since inception and may continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe have had a history of operating losses and we expect that operating losses will continue into the near term. Although we have had sales of the Argus II product, these limited sales were insufficient to cover our operating expenses. Given the limited addressable market of Argus II, we no longer market the Argus II and have focused all of our resources on the development of Orion. Our ability to generate positive cash flow will hinge on our ability to develop the Orion visual prosthesis, correctly price our product to our markets, and obtain government and private insurance reimbursement. As of December 31, 2020 we had negative stockholders\u2019 equity of $0.7 million and an accumulated deficit of $319.7 million. We cannot assure you that we will be profitable even if we successfully commercialize our products. Failure to become and remain profitable may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital and continue operations.\nOur business is subject to international economic, political and other risks that could negatively affect our results of operations or financial position.\nWe anticipate that revenue from Europe and other countries outside the U.S. may be material to our future long-term success. Accordingly, our operations are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, including:\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange variations;\n\u2022\nextended collection timelines for accounts receivable;\n\u2022\ngreater working capital requirements;\n\u2022\nmultiple legal frameworks and unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nthe need to ensure compliance with the numerous regulatory and legal requirements applicable to our business in each of these jurisdictions and to maintain an effective compliance program to ensure compliance with these requirements;\n\u2022\npolitical changes in the foreign governments impacting health policy and trade;\n\u2022\ntariffs, export restrictions, trade barriers and other regulatory or contractual limitations that could impact our ability to sell or develop our products in certain foreign markets;\n\u2022\ntrade laws and business practices favoring local competition; and\n\u2022\nadverse economic conditions, including the stability and solvency of business financial markets, financial institutions and sovereign nations and the healthcare expenditure of domestic or foreign nations.\nThe realization of any of these or other risks associated with operating in Europe or other non-U.S. countries could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe are subject to stringent domestic and foreign medical device regulation and any unfavorable regulatory action may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and business operations.\nOur products, development activities and manufacturing processes are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by numerous government agencies, including the FDA and comparable foreign agencies. To varying degrees, each of these agencies monitors and enforces our compliance with laws and regulations governing the development, testing,\nmanufacturing, labeling, marketing, distribution, and the safety and effectiveness of our medical devices. The process of obtaining marketing approval or clearance from the FDA and comparable foreign bodies for new products, or for enhancements, expansion of the indications or modifications to existing products, could:\n\u2022\ntake a significant, indeterminate amount of time;\n\u2022\nresult in product shortages due to regulatory delays;\n\u2022\nrequire the expenditure of substantial resources;\n\u2022\ninvolve rigorous pre-clinical and clinical testing, and possibly post-market surveillance;\n\u2022\ninvolve modifications, repairs or replacements of our products;\n\u2022\nrequire design changes of our products;\n\u2022\nresult in limitations on the indicated uses of our products; and\n\u2022\nresult in our never being granted the regulatory approval we seek.\nAny of these occurrences that we might experience will cause our operations to suffer, harm our competitive standing and result in further losses that adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe have ongoing responsibilities under FDA and international regulations, both before and after a product is commercially released. For example, we are required to comply with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation (QSR), which mandates that manufacturers of medical devices adhere to certain quality assurance requirements pertaining, among other things, to validation of manufacturing processes, controls for purchasing product components, and documentation practices. As another example, the Medical Device Reporting regulation requires us to provide information to the FDA whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or that a malfunction occurred which would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury upon recurrence. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously through periodic inspections by the FDA. If the FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the FDA could ban such medical devices, detain or seize such medical devices, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of such devices, or require us to notify health professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA has been increasing its scrutiny of the medical device industry and the government is expected to continue to scrutinize the industry closely with inspections and possibly enforcement actions by the FDA or other agencies. Additionally, the FDA may restrict manufacturing and impose other operating restrictions, enjoin and restrain certain violations of applicable law pertaining to medical devices and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers, employees, or us. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively manufacturing, marketing and selling our products. In addition, negative publicity and product liability claims resulting from any adverse regulatory action could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe number of preclinical and clinical tests that will be required for regulatory approval varies depending on the disease or condition to be treated, the jurisdiction in which we are seeking approval and the regulations applicable to that particular medical device. Regulatory agencies, including those in the U.S., Canada, Europe and other countries where medical devices are regulated, can delay, limit or deny approval of a product for many reasons. For example,\n\u2022\na medical device may not be safe or effective;\n\u2022\nregulatory agencies may interpret data from preclinical and clinical testing differently than we do;\n\u2022\nregulatory agencies may not approve our manufacturing processes;\n\u2022\nregulatory agencies may conclude that our device does not meet quality standards for durability, long-term reliability, biocompatibility, electromagnetic compatibility, electrical safety; and\n\u2022\nregulatory agencies may change their approval policies or adopt new regulations.\nThe FDA may make requests or suggestions regarding conduct of our clinical trials, resulting in an increased risk of difficulties or delays in obtaining regulatory approval in the U.S. Any of these occurrences could prove materially harmful to our operations and business.\nOur revenue from sales of Orion will be dependent upon the pricing and reimbursement guidelines adopted in each country and if pricing and reimbursement levels are inadequate to achieve profitability our operations will suffer.\nOur financial success is dependent on our ability to price our products in a manner acceptable to government and private payors while still maintaining our profit margins. Numerous factors that may be beyond our control may\nultimately impact our pricing of Orion and determine whether we are able to obtain reimbursement or reimbursement at adequate levels from governmental programs and private insurance. If we are unable to obtain reimbursement or our product is not adequately reimbursed, we will experience reduced sales, our revenues likely will be adversely affected, and we may not become profitable.\nObtaining reimbursement approvals is time consuming, requires substantial management attention, and is expensive. Our business will be materially adversely affected if we do not receive approval for reimbursement of Orion under government programs and from private insurers on a timely or satisfactory basis. Limitations on coverage could also be imposed at the local Medicare Administrative Contractor level or by fiscal intermediaries in the U.S., and by regional or national funding agencies in Europe. Our business could be materially adversely affected if the Medicare program, local Medicare Administrative Contractors or fiscal intermediaries were to make such a determination and deny, restrict or limit the reimbursement of Orion. Similarly in Europe, these governmental and other agencies could deny, restrict or limit the reimbursement of Orion at the hospital, regional or national level. Our business also could be adversely affected if surgeons and the facilities within which they operate are not adequately reimbursed by Medicare and other funding agencies for the cost of the procedure in which they implant the Orion on a basis satisfactory to the administering surgeons and their facilities. If the local contractors that administer the Medicare program and other funding agencies are slow to reimburse surgeons or provider facilities for the Argus II system, the surgeons and facilities may delay their payments to us, which would adversely affect our working capital requirements. Also, if the funding agencies delay reimbursement payments to the hospitals, any increase to their working capital requirements could reduce their willingness to treat blind patients who wish to have our Orion devices implanted. If reimbursement for our products is unavailable, limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business will be materially harmed.\nOur product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit the commercial profile of an approved label, or result in significant negative consequences following marketing approval, if any.\nIn order to obtain marketing approval for Orion we must demonstrate the safety and efficacy of Orion through clinical trials as well as additional supporting data. If Orion is associated with undesirable side effects in clinical trials or have characteristics that are unexpected, we may need to interrupt, delay or abandon Orion\u2019s development, cause it to have reduced functionality, or limit development to more narrow uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. We are conducting a six subject initial feasibility clinical study of Orion at UCLA and Baylor, but we cannot guarantee that any positive results in this limited trial will successfully translate to a pivotal clinical trial. It is not uncommon to observe results in human clinical trials that are unexpected based on limited trials testing, and many product candidates fail in large clinical trials despite promising limited clinical trial results. Moreover, clinical data is often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval for their products. No assurance can be given that we will not encounter similar results in our Orion trials.\nHuman subjects in our clinical trials may suffer significant adverse events, tolerability issues or other side effects associated with the surgical implantation, chronic implantation, and chronic use of the Orion device. These events include, but are not limited to, the following (events that are also anticipated during or following explanation of the Orion device are identified with an asterisk (*)): intracranial hemorrhage*; subcutaneous hematoma*; vascular injury causing stroke or hemorrhage (e.g. injury to the superior sagittal sinus or posterior cerebral artery perforators)*; hydrocephalus*; intracranial hypotension or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak*; headache or pain in the head, including deep pain*; tingling at the implant site*; brain edema*; infection*; meningitis*; implant site pain, swelling, discharge or effusion*; suture-related complications or stitch abscess*; skin erosion on and/or around the implant site; adverse tissue reaction to the implant; tissue damage at the implant/explant site*; cranial defect/bone damage*; decline in residual vision*; dizziness/syncope*; foreign body sensation at the implant site*; activation of motor or sensory neurons (e.g., muscle twitch); clinically symptomatic seizure*; development of epilepsy; coma*; death*; psychiatric events, including but not limited to mood changes, depression, suicidality, and psychosis*; neurological deficit, including but not limited to language (dysphemia), dysesthesias, paresis, paresthesia, visual field, motor deficit (including apraxia), and memory impairment*; drug hypersensitivity, adverse drug reaction, or therapeutic agent toxicity*; events related to any surgery and general anesthesia including cardiac risks, including stroke/transient\nischemic attack, arrhythmia, cardiac arrest, and myocardial infarction*, venous thromboembolic (VTE) disease*; pneumonia*, urinary tract infection*, post-operative delirium*, postoperative constipation*, post-operative vomiting or nausea*, or post-operative fever*; injuries due to falls or bumps; skin irritation or burns; Orion system failure or malfunction; array migration; damage to the Orion electronics case; device interaction including the Orion device may interfere with the proper functioning of other electronic devices and emissions from other electronic equipment may interfere with the proper functioning of the Orion device; and (explant only) inability to remove all or part of the Orion device due to fibrosis or other reason.\nNo assurance can be given that we will not encounter adverse events in our Orion trials. The observed efficacy and extent of light perception and vision restoration for subjects implanted with Orion in our feasibility study may not be maintained over the long term, or may not be observed in a larger pivotal clinical trial. If general clinical trials of Orion fail to demonstrate efficacy to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities or do not otherwise produce positive results, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of Orion.\nFor example, in June 2018, one subject in our Early Feasibility Study for Orion (\u201cEFS\u201d) experienced a seizure while in the clinic when we were evaluating a specific video stimulation algorithm. The seizure resolved quickly with medication and the subject was released from the clinic without need for hospitalization or further treatment. The subject was allowed to continue using the Orion device after the serious adverse event was reviewed by a safety committee for the study and clinicians at the implanting institution.\nIn addition, in January 2019 we observed higher impedance levels on 11 of 60 electrodes with the first EFS subject implanted with the Orion device in January 2018. As a result, some of these electrodes no longer generated a phosphene, or observable spot of light, for the subject. The subject continues to use the device and is continuing to participate in the clinical study. Mechanical and software safeguards are built into the device to avoid excessive electrical stimulation and, as a result, the higher impedance levels do not pose any known safety risks to the subject. Given the pattern of high impedances, we took the precaution of disabling half of the electrodes on the array to ensure that other potentially affected electrodes are not used. Root cause(s) for the higher impedance levels cannot be conclusively determined while the device remains implanted but could include any combination of the following: potential manufacturing defects, damage due to improper or excessive handling of the device, materials chosen for the design, and related processes. The first subject has been implanted with the device for 36 months, four subjects have been implanted for 31-33 months, and one subject for 24 months. We currently have no indication that the issue exists with any of the Orion devices implanted in each of the other five EFS subjects. Prior to initiation of EFS, we subjected six Orion implants to accelerated aging tests and had no failures for what was the equivalent of up to 6.5 years.\nIn October 2019, we also observed changes to impedances (higher and lower) on most electrodes with the sixth EFS subject implanted with the device in January 2019. These impedance changes were coincident with a loss of most perception from the device, though there is no indication of a medical adverse event or a device defect. When examined again in November 2019, this sixth EFS subject showed improved perception and more normal impedances including performance on the 12-month visual function and functional vision assessments that was similar to pre-incident performance. We are currently investigating the possible root cause(s) for these changes, which may or may not be device related (that is the possible root causes may be subject related) and may or may not continue to improve or worsen again.\nWe cannot provide any assurance that we will not experience similar or other issues with any of the implanted Orion devices, be able to determine the root cause of the issue or to ascertain whether the issue is isolated or systemic in nature. Additional testing, investigation, design changes or mitigation activities may delay our plans to conduct additional clinical studies for Orion and/or our marketing approval and may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf device defects, significant adverse events or other side effects are observed in any of our future clinical trials, we may have difficulty recruiting subjects to the clinical trial, subjects may drop out of our trial, or we may be required to abandon the trial or our development efforts of that product candidate altogether. We, the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities may suspend clinical trials of Orion at any time for various reasons, including a belief that subjects in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks. Devices developed in the prosthesis industry\nthat initially showed promise in early-stage studies have later been found to cause side effects that prevented their further development. Even if the side effects do not preclude Orion from obtaining or maintaining marketing approval, undesirable side effects may inhibit market acceptance of the approved product due to its actual or perceived safety and tolerability profile. Any of these developments could materially harm our business, financial condition and prospects.\nShould Orion obtain marketing approval, adverse effects associated with it may also develop after such approval and could lead to requirements for conducting additional clinical safety trials, placing additional warnings in the labeling, imposing significant restrictions on Orion, or withdrawing the Orion from the market while further incurring attendant costs of explants and exposure to litigation. We cannot predict whether Orion will cause significant adverse effects in humans that would preclude or lead to the revocation of regulatory approval. However, any such event, were it to occur, would cause substantial harm to our business and financial condition and would result in the diversion of our management\u2019s attention.\nWe are also subject to stringent government regulation in European and other foreign countries, which could delay or prevent our ability to sell our products in those jurisdictions.\nWe intend to pursue market authorizations for the Orion system and other product candidates in additional jurisdictions and undergo additional audits. For us to market our products in Europe and some other international jurisdictions, we and our distributors and agents must obtain required regulatory registrations or approvals. The approval procedure varies among countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional testing, and the time and costs required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain an approval by the FDA. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA. Violations of foreign laws governing use of medical devices may lead to actions against us by the FDA as well as by foreign authorities. We must also comply with extensive regulations regarding safety, efficacy and quality in those jurisdictions. We may not be able to obtain all the required regulatory registrations or approvals, or we may be required to incur significant costs in obtaining or maintaining any regulatory registrations or approvals we receive. Delays in obtaining any registrations or approvals required for marketing our products, failure to receive these registrations or approvals, or future loss of previously obtained registrations or approvals would limit our ability to sell our products internationally. For example, international regulatory bodies have adopted various regulations governing product standards, packaging requirements, labeling requirements, import restrictions, tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements. These regulations vary from country to country. In order to sell our products in Europe, we must maintain our ISO 13485:2016 certification and CE mark certification, which is an international symbol of quality and compliance with applicable European medical device directives. Failure to maintain the ISO 13485:2003 certification or CE mark certification or other international regulatory approvals would prevent us from selling in some countries in Europe and elsewhere. The failure to obtain these approvals could harm our business materially.\nEven if we obtain clearance or approval to sell our products, we are subject to ongoing requirements and inspections that could lead to the restriction, suspension or revocation of our clearance.\nWe, as well as any potential collaborative partners such as distributors, will be required to adhere to applicable FDA regulations regarding good manufacturing practice, which include testing, control, and documentation requirements. We are subject to similar regulations in foreign countries. Even if regulatory approval of a product is granted, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval or contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. Ongoing compliance with good manufacturing practice and other applicable regulatory requirements is strictly enforced in the United States through periodic inspections by state and federal agencies, including the FDA, and in international jurisdictions by comparable agencies. Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements could result in, among other things, warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, failure to obtain premarket clearance or premarket approval for devices, withdrawal of approvals previously obtained, and criminal prosecution. The restriction, suspension or revocation of regulatory approvals or any other failure to comply with regulatory requirements would limit our ability to operate and could increase our costs.\nWe have no large-scale manufacturing experience, which could limit our growth.\nOur limited manufacturing experience may not enable us to make products in the volumes that would be necessary for us to achieve a significant amount of commercial sales. Our product involves new and technologically complex materials and processes and we currently experience low yields on our manufacturing process. As we move from making small quantities of our product for clinical trials to larger quantities for greater commercial distribution, we must develop new manufacturing techniques and processes that allow us to scale production. We may not be able to establish and maintain reliable, efficient, full scale manufacturing at commercially reasonable costs in a timely fashion. Difficulties we encounter in manufacturing scale-up, or our failure to implement and maintain our manufacturing facilities in accordance with good manufacturing practice regulations, international quality standards or other regulatory requirements, could result in a delay or termination of production. To date, our manufacturing activities have largely been to provide units for clinical testing and commercial sales of the now discontinued Argus II system. We may face substantial difficulties in establishing and maintaining manufacturing for our products at a larger commercial scale and those difficulties may impact the quality of our products and adversely affect our ability to increase sales.\nTo establish our sales and marketing infrastructure, we will need to grow the size of our organization, and we may experience delays or other difficulties in managing this growth.\nAs our development and commercialization plans and strategies evolve, we will need to expand the size of our employee base for managerial, operational, sales, marketing, financial and other resources. Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain, motivate and integrate additional employees. Our management team may have to use a substantial amount of time to manage these growth activities. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize the Orion system and our other product candidates and compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to timely and effectively manage any future growth and related costs. We may not be able to effectively manage a rapid pace of growth and timely implement improvements to our management infrastructure and control systems.\nWe may acquire additional businesses or form strategic alliances in the future, and we may not realize the benefits of such acquisitions or alliances.\nWe may acquire additional businesses or products, form strategic alliances or create joint ventures with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our proposed Orion development activity and business. If we acquire businesses with promising markets or technologies, we may not be able to realize the benefit of acquiring such businesses if we are unable to successfully integrate them with our existing operations and company culture. We may have difficulty in developing, manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines to realize value from expected synergies. We cannot assure that, following an acquisition, we will achieve the revenues or specific net income that justifies the acquisition.\nOur ability to utilize and benefit from our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had federal and state of California income tax net operating loss carryforwards, which may be applied to future taxable income, of approximately $116.1 million and $58.1 million, respectively. To the extent that we continue to generate taxable losses, unused losses will carry forward to offset future taxable income, if any, until these unused losses expire. However, we may be unable to use these losses to offset taxable income before our unused losses expire at various dates that range from 2035 through 2037 for federal net operating losses generated before 2020. Federal net operating losses generated for year 2018 and forward do not expire. State net operating losses expire from 2033 through 2040. Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards to offset its post-change taxable income may be limited. Limitations may also apply to the utilization of other pre-change tax attributes as a result of an ownership change.\nWe experienced an \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Section 382(g) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, during the second quarter of 2017. The ownership change will subject our net operating loss carryforwards to an annual limitation, which will significantly restrict our ability to use them to offset taxable income in periods following the ownership change. In general, the annual use limitation equals the aggregate value of our\nstock at the time of the ownership change multiplied by a tax-exempt interest rate specified by the Internal Revenue Service. We have analyzed the available information to determine the amount of the annual limitation. Based on information available to us, the 2017 limitation is estimated to range between $1.4 million and $3.7 million annually. In total, we estimate that the 2017 ownership change will result in approximately $120 million and $56 million of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards expiring unused.\nRisks Related to the Securities Market, and Ownership of Our Common Stock\nAlthough we believe that our strategy to (i) leverage proven Argus II technology to develop the Orion visual cortical prosthesis and (ii) significantly expand our addressable market to include a portion of the almost six million patients who are blind from eye trauma, optic nerve disease and injury, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma and other untreatable causes is more likely to address a better and faster way to treat many causes of blindness, we will incur material near term losses, market uncertainty and our stock may experience significant fluctuations as we continue to focus exclusively on Orion.\nBased on assessments of the development of our Orion technology and the positive results in our Early Feasibility Study of the six subjects implanted with the Orion at UCLA Medical Center and Baylor College of Medicine, in May 2019 our Board approved an acceleration of our transition from the Argus II to the Orion platform so we may more rapidly implement our strategy of treating blindness domestically and worldwide. As a result, we will or have:\n\u2022\naccelerated the changeover to, and upgrades of, our supply chain, manufacturing and quality assurance processes, as well as our facilities and talent pool to the Orion program and suspended production of Argus II system;\n\u2022\nmanufacture Orion devices that we will require to support FDA approval of the Orion commercial product;\n\u2022\nseek to conduct a larger feasibility study or a pivotal clinical trial with the intent of seeking regulatory approval for marketing Orion in the U.S.;\n\u2022\nterminated our commercial activities and other costs associated with expanding or maintaining Argus II sales;\n\u2022\nlimit future sales and implants of the Argus II to finished units and inventory on hand;\n\u2022\nincurred non-cash impairment charges of approximately $2.6 million relating to Argus II inventory in the year ended December 31, 2019;\n\u2022\nincurred cash severance and related expenses of approximately $800,000 in the year ended December 31, 2019 affecting employees primarily associated with Argus II operations; and\n\u2022\ncease supporting the Argus II patient population.\nAs a result of this transition from Argus II, our future success will depend on the further development, regulatory approval and commercialization of the Orion product. Although we believe this more rapid changeover and implementation of our long term strategy for treating blindness by Orion will provide us a sizable, commercially sustainable domestic and worldwide market for our products, in the near term we will incur significant losses, market volatility and regulatory uncertainty, including uncertainty associated with pricing and reimbursement coverage with no current assurance of market acceptance. No assurance can be given that this strategy will achieve domestic and regulatory approvals or result in commercial viability of our products or our company.\nIf we are unable to obtain sufficient funding, we may be unable to execute our business plan and fund operations. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\n\ufeff\nWe have experienced operating losses, and we may continue to incur operating losses for the next several years as we implement our business plan. Currently, we have no revenue and do not have arrangements in place for all the\nanticipated financing that would be required to fully implement our business plan. Our prior losses combined with expected future losses, have had and will continue to have, for the foreseeable future, an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital.\n\ufeff\nWe will need to raise additional capital in order to continue to execute our business plan in the future however there is no assurance that we will be successful, or that additional financing will be available when needed or that management will be able to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us. If we are unable to raise sufficient additional funds, we will need to further scale back our operations. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and resulting negative impact on the global macroeconomic environment and capital markets may make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds.\nWe cannot give any assurance that we will be able to obtain all the necessary funding that we may need. In addition, we believe that we will require additional capital in the future to fully develop our technologies and planned products to the stage of FDA approvals and a commercial launch. We have pursued and may pursue additional funding through various financing sources, including the private sale of our equity and debt securities, licensing fees for our technology, joint ventures with capital partners and project type financing. If we raise funds by issuing equity or equity-linked securities, dilution to some or all our stockholders will result. Any equity securities issued may also provide for rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. The terms of debt securities issued or borrowings could impose significant restrictions on our operations. We also may seek government-based financing, such as development and research grants. There can be no assurance that funds will be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\n\ufeff\nThe incurrence of indebtedness or the issuance of certain equity securities could result in increased fixed payment obligations and could also result in restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt or issue additional equity, limitations on our ability to acquire or license intellectual property rights, and other operating restrictions that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. In addition, the issuance of additional equity securities by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In the event that we enter into collaborations or licensing arrangements to raise capital, we may be required to accept unfavorable terms. These agreements may require that we relinquish, or license to a third party on unfavorable terms, our rights to technologies or product candidates that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves, or reserve certain opportunities for future potential arrangements when we might otherwise be able to achieve more favorable terms. In addition, we may be forced to work with a partner on one or more of our products or market development programs, which could lower the economic value of those programs to us.\nIf we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, we may terminate or delay the development of one or more of our Orion features updated products, delay clinical trials necessary to market our products, or delay establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or other activities necessary to commercialize our products. If this were to occur, our ability to grow and support our business and to respond to market challenges could be significantly limited or we may be unable to continue operations, in which case you could lose your entire investment.\nIf our development activity, regulatory efforts and substantial investments related to Orion do not result in a commercial product or if our company never achieves profitability or positive free cash flow, our stock price will decline, we will not be able to sustain operations and our stockholders may incur a complete loss of their investment in our company. The price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile and the value of your investment could decline.\nMedical technology stocks have historically experienced high levels of volatility. The trading prices of our common stock have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate substantially. The market price of our common stock may be higher or lower than the price you pay, depending on many factors, some of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance. These fluctuations could cause you to lose substantially all or part of your investment in our common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock include:\n\u2022\nannouncements of new offerings, products, services, therapies, treatments or technologies, commercial relationships, acquisitions or other events by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nchallenges to our patents and the patents and intellectual property that we license;\n\u2022\nUnited States and European approvals or denials of our products;\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n\u2022\nsignificant volatility in the market price and trading volume of medical device or technology companies in general;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the trading volume of our shares or the size of our public float;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes or fluctuations in our results of operations;\n\u2022\nwhether our results of operations meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in the expectations of investors or securities analysts;\n\u2022\nlitigation involving us, our industry, or both;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments in the United States, foreign countries, or both;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and trends;\n\u2022\nmajor catastrophic events;\n\u2022\nsales of large blocks of our common stock;\n\u2022\ndepartures of key employees; and\n\u2022\nan adverse impact on our business from any of the other risks cited herein.\nIn addition, if the market for medical technology stocks or the stock market, in general, experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, results of operations or financial condition. The trading price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. If our stock price is volatile, we may become the target of securities litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources from our business. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are currently not in compliance with Nasdaq listing standards. If our common stock is delisted, the market price and liquidity of our common stock and our ability to raise additional capital would be adversely impacted.\nOur common stock and warrants are currently listed on Nasdaq. Continued listing of a security on Nasdaq is conditioned upon compliance with various continued listing standards.\nAs previously disclosed, Nasdaq notified us on April 15, 2020, that due to the appointment of one of our independent directors as the acting Chief Executive Officer effective March 27, 2020, we no longer complied with Nasdaq\u2019s independent director and audit committee requirements as set forth in Listing Rule 5605. On June 1, 2020, Nasdaq notified us that following the resignation of William J. Link as a director effective May 31, 2020, our noncompliance with the Listing Rules was then due to more than one vacancy on our board and audit committee. As a result, Nasdaq advised us that we were no longer eligible for the cure period set forth in our Form 8-K filed June 4, 2020 and that a plan of compliance was required to be submitted no later than July 16, 2020.\nOur board of directors concluded that our non-executive Chair, Gregg Williams, meets the criteria of an independent director and has appointed Mr. Williams to be a member of the Audit Committee as of June 22, 2020, as a result of which we have only one vacancy on our board and committees. In the July 15, 2020 letter, Nasdaq acknowledged our conclusion regarding Mr. Williams\u2019 independent director status and appointment to the Audit Committee. As a result, we are again eligible for the cure period provided in Nasdaq\u2019s Listing Rules. As such, Nasdaq reiterated that consistent with Listing Rules 5605(b)(1)(A) and 5605(c)(4), the Company\u2019s cure period to regain compliance was provided to be as follows:\n\u2022\nuntil the earlier of the Company\u2019s next annual shareholders\u2019 meeting or March 27, 2021;\nor\n\u2022\nif the next annual shareholders\u2019 meeting is held before September 23, 2020, then the\nCompany must evidence compliance no later than September 23, 2020.\nBy notice dated January 4, 2021, Nasdaq advised us that since the Company has not held an annual meeting of shareholders within twelve months of the end of the Company\u2019s fiscal year end, we are no longer in compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules (the\u201d Listing Rules\u201d) for continued listing. On February 18, 2021, the Company submitted a plan for correction of this deficiency to Nasdaq. Subsequently, on February 23, 2021 we were granted an extension of time to regain compliance with these Rules until May 30, 2021. If we do not regain compliance with the Rules or receive a further extension by that date, our common stock will be subject to delisting\nWe have no assurance that we will be able to regain compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s listing rules. If our securities are delisted from Nasdaq, we could experience reduced market liquidity of our common stock which could result in a corresponding material reduction in the price of our common stock. Delisting moreover could harm our ability to raise capital on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and may result in the potential loss of confidence by investors, employees and business development opportunities.\nIf shares of our common stock cease to be listed on a national exchange we will not be subject to compliance with rules requiring the adoption of certain corporate governance measures and as a result our stockholders may experience reduced protections.\nEach of the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC require the implementation of various measures relating to corporate governance for listed companies. These quantitative and qualitative measures are designed to enhance the integrity of corporate management and the securities markets and apply to securities which are listed on those stock exchanges. While we have adopted these measures, we will not be required to comply with many of the corporate governance provisions if our common stock is not listed on a national securities exchange. As a result, if we cease to be listed on national exchange and elect to cease compliance with any of the corporate governance measures required by national exchanges, our stockholders may lose protections afforded to listed companies.\nIf shares of our common stock cease to be listed on a national exchange they will become subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules of the SEC and the trading market in our securities may become limited, which will make transactions in our stock cumbersome and may reduce the value of an investment in the stock.\nRule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act establishes the definition of a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d for the purposes relevant to us, as any equity security that is no longer trading on a national exchange and has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require: (a) that a broker or dealer approve a person\u2019s account for transactions in penny stocks; and (b) the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction, setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased.\nIn order to approve a person\u2019s account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must: (a) obtain financial information and investment experience objectives of the person and (b) make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks.\nThe broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prescribed by the SEC relating to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form: (a) sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination; and (b) confirms that the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction. Generally, brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules. This may make it more difficult for investors to dispose of our common stock and cause a decline in the market value of our common stock.\nDisclosure also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading and about the commissions payable to both the broker or dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks.\nIf shares of our common stock cease to be listed on a national exchange our securities will not be eligible for federal preemption rights and be subject to state \u201cblue sky\u201d laws which may affect our capabilities of raising capital.\nEach state has its own securities laws, often called \u201cblue sky\u201d laws, which (i) limit sales of securities to a state\u2019s residents unless the securities are registered in that state or qualify for an exemption from registration, and (ii) govern the reporting requirements for broker-dealers doing business directly or indirectly in the state. Before a security is sold in a state, there must be a registration in place to cover the transaction, or the transaction must be exempt from registration. The applicable broker must be registered in that state. We do not know whether securities will be registered or exempt from registration under the laws of any state. If our securities cease to be listed on the national exchange, a determination regarding registration will be made by those broker-dealers, if any, who agree to serve as the market-makers for our common stock. Registering or qualifying shares with states can be time consuming. Compliance and regulatory costs may vary from state to state and may adversely affect future financings and our ability to raise capital.\nIf our common stock is delisted from national exchange some institutional investors may not be allowed to purchase our shares and may be required to liquidate their current positions in our stock which could negatively affect the price and volatility of our shares.\nInstitutional investors may be restricted by their investment policies from investing in shares of companies that are not listed on a national exchange and may be required to liquidate their positions if our securities are delisted from a national exchange. Liquidations, should they occur, may increase volatility and cause wide fluctuations and further declines in the prices of our securities.\nDelisting of our common stock from national exchange can cause material dilution of our stock in future financings which can erode shareholder value.\nIf we are not able to maintain listing of our securities on Nasdaq the trading prices of our securities may decline and we may need to sell larger amounts of our securities to obtain needed operating capital, possibly at prices which are at further discounts to the market or upon other terms that are less favorable to us, subjecting our shareholders to material dilution and losses to their investment.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public or private markets could reduce the price of our common stock and may dilute your voting power and ownership interest in us.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public or private markets, or the perception that these sales could occur, as well as sales of shares by directors or officers, which have occurred or which may occur from time to time, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and may make it more difficult for you to sell your common stock at a time and price that you deem appropriate.\nEntities controlled by Gregg Williams, our Chairman of the Board, have the ability to influence or control the outcome of matters submitted for stockholder approval, may limit your ability to influence outcomes of director elections and may have interests that differ from those of our other stockholders.\nAs of March 1, 2021, entities controlled and beneficially owned by Gregg Williams, our Chairman of the Board, own of record an aggregate of approximately 42.6% of the outstanding shares of our common stock (or 54.5% after giving effect to Mr. Williams\u2019 right to acquire beneficial ownership of 6,029,896 shares of common stock upon exercise of options or warrants). As a result, Mr. Williams is able to exercise substantial influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including\n\u2022\nelecting or defeating the election of our directors;\n\u2022\namending or preventing amendment of our articles of incorporation or bylaws;\n\u2022\neffecting or preventing a merger, sale of assets or other corporate transaction; and\n\u2022\ncontrolling the outcome of any other matter submitted to our stockholders for vote.\nMr. Williams may also have interests that differ from other stockholders and he may vote in a manner that is or could be deemed as adverse to interests of other stockholders. His majority stock ownership could discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company, which in turn could reduce our stock price or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over our stock price. This concentration of voting power may have the effect of deterring, delaying or impeding actions that could be beneficial to other stockholders.\nWe have obtained significant invested amounts from entities affiliated with Mr. Williams, our Chairman of the Board, and if as we seek additional funding to support our business Mr. Williams does not participate in our future offerings, we may not be able to raise needed amounts and our operations may be adversely affected.\nDuring 2019 and 2020, we funded our business primarily through the issuance and sale of our securities. We obtained approximate proceeds of $10 million in May 2018, $5 million in August 2018, $4 million in October 2018, $3 million in December 2018 and $30 million in February 2019 from the sale of our securities to entities affiliated with Mr. Williams, our Chairman of the Board, constituting 100%, 100%, 100%, 100% and 86.7% respectively, of amounts received in the offerings we completed. On December 8, 2020, borrowed $1 million from Gregg Williams on an unsecured basis at an interest of 12% per year. This loan is due and payable on December 31, 2021. To the extent that we may need additional capital we expect that we will seek to fund our operations through public or private equity or debt financings, grants, collaborations, strategic partnerships or other sources. No assurance can be given that Mr. Williams or entities affiliated with him will continue to participate in any offerings of our securities or that we will be able to obtain additional capital from him. If we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis, our business and operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock. We intend to retain any earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the future. As a result, you may only receive a return on your investment in our common stock if the market price of our common stock increases.\nFuture sales and issuances of our equity securities or rights to purchase our equity securities, including pursuant to our equity incentive plans, would result in dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.\nTo the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities; our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction, investors may be diluted by subsequent sales. Such sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights superior to existing stockholders.\nThe public market for our common stock has been volatile since completion of our initial public offering in November 2014. This volatility may affect the ability of our investors to sell their shares as well as the price at which they sell their shares.\nWe completed our initial public offering in November 2014. Since that time, our per share and day-to-day trading prices have often been volatile. This volatility may continue or increase in the future. The market price for the shares may be significantly affected by factors such as progress in the development of our technology, progress in our pre-clinical and clinical trials, agreements with research facilities or co-development partners, commercialization of our technology, coverage by third-party payors, variations in quarterly and yearly operating results, general trends in the medical device industry, and changes in FDA and foreign regulations affecting us and our industry. Furthermore, in recent years the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the affected companies. Those broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nSubstantial future sales of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.\nIf our common stockholders (including those persons who may become common stockholders upon exercise of our options or warrants) sell substantial amounts of our common stock, or the public market perceives that stockholders might sell substantial amounts of our common stock, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly. Such sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that our management deems appropriate.\nWe have the right to issue shares of preferred stock. If we were to issue preferred stock, it is likely to have rights, preferences and privileges that may adversely affect the common stock.\nWe are authorized to issue 10 million shares of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, with such rights, preferences and privileges as may be determined from time to time by our board of directors. Our board of directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock in one or more series, and to fix for any series the dividend rights, dissolution or liquidation preferences, redemption prices, conversion rights, voting rights, and other rights, preferences and privileges for the preferred stock. No shares of preferred stock are presently issued and outstanding and we have no immediate plans to issue shares of preferred stock. The issuance of shares of preferred stock, depending on the rights, preferences and privileges attributable to the preferred stock, could adversely reduce the voting rights and powers of the common stock and the portion of our assets allocated for distribution to common stockholders in a liquidation event, and could also result in dilution in the book value per share of our common stock. The preferred stock could also be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method for raising additional capital or discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control of our Company, to the detriment of the holders of our common stock. We cannot assure you that we will not, under certain circumstances, issue shares of our preferred stock.\nWe may be assessed penalties and fines under California\u2019s board gender diversity statute which required publicly held companies to have a minimum of one female on boards of directors as of the end of 2019.\nCalifornia\u2019s gender diversity law, which went into effect on January 1, 2019, requires publicly held corporations with securities listed on a major U.S. stock exchange and having principal executive offices in California (a covered corporation) to have at least one female director for each of calendar year 2019 and 2020. Beginning in calendar year 2021 covered corporations with six or more directors must have at least three female directors by the end of the calendar year. If the covered corporation has five directors then there must be a minimum of two women directors, and if the covered corporation has four or fewer directors then it must have at least one woman director. We have no female board members currently nor as of December 31, 2020. The law authorized the imposition of fines or penalties for violations of the new law in amounts of $100,000 for the first violation and $300,000 for each subsequent violation. Moreover the California Secretary of State was authorized to adopt regulations that could impose a $100,000 penalty for failure to timely comply and file board member information with the Secretary of State, however no such regulations have been promulgated to date. We are aware of two cases challenging implementation of the new law, Crest v. Alex Padilla and Creighton Meland v. Alex Padilla, Secretary of State of California, challenging the validity of the law and seeking a permanent injunction against enforcement of the statute. The Meland case was dismissed without prejudice and was appealed to the U.S Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\nA pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease, such as COVID-19, a novel strain of coronavirus, may materially and adversely affect our business and our financial results.\nPublic health epidemics or widespread outbreaks of contagious diseases could adversely impact our business. Any outbreak of contagious diseases, and other adverse public health developments, such as the recent novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19), initially limited to a region in China and now affecting the global community, could impact our operations depending on future developments, which are highly uncertain, largely beyond our control and cannot be predicted with certainty. These uncertain factors include the duration of the outbreak, potential impact to our employees who may contract the disease or be subject to quarantine, new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the disease and the actions to contain or treat its impact, such as the temporary closure of facilities or diversion of healthcare resources, including clinical trial sites, the flow of goods in our supply chains and the ability for third-party service providers to fulfill their contractual obligations to us. These factors may disrupt our ability to conduct our existing and future clinical trials in the U.S., cause disruptions or restrictions on our employees\u2019 ability to work and have a material adverse effect on our overall productivity.\nWe may also experience a more challenging fundraising environment that may restrict our access to capital both publicly and privately amid the recent escalated volatility of the U.S. and global financial markets, increases in travel restrictions, quarantines, business shut downs or warnings and from potential disruptions or delays of trade, scientific, and investor conferences. Should we experience any of these or other currently unforeseen consequences of a health epidemic, pandemic or other outbreak, including the current COVID-19 outbreak, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to the Business Combination\nThe Business Combination is subject to conditions, some or all of which may not be satisfied, or completed on a timely basis, if at all. Failure to complete, or unexpected delays in completing the Business Combination or any termination of the Memorandum of Understanding could have material adverse effects on us.\nOn January 5, 2021 we entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with Pixium pursuant to which (i) we will raise additional working capital of at least $25,000,000 in a private placement of equity securities of Second Sight to accredited investors (the \u201cFund Raising\u201d); (ii) Pixium will contribute to us certain assets in exchange for newly issued common stock of Second Sight (the \u201cContribution\u201d); and (iii) we will transfer our Orion assets to a newly formed subsidiary (\u201cSpinCo\u201d), the share capital of which would be partially spun-off to our shareholders (the \u201cSpin-Off\u201d and, together with the Fund Raising and the Contribution, the \u201cBusiness Combination\u201d). The completion of the Business Combination is subject to a number of conditions, including, among other things, the receipt in escrow of no less than $25 million in connection with the Fund Raising, approval by the shareholders of Second Sight and Pixium and the bondholders of Pixium and the receipt of certain regulatory approvals. The failure to satisfy all of the required conditions could delay the completion of the Business Combination for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring at all. There can be no assurance that the conditions to the completion of the Business Combination will be satisfied or waived or that the Business Combination will be completed.\nEither Pixium or Second Sight may terminate the Memorandum of Understanding under certain circumstances, including if the Business Combination is not completed by June 4, 2021. In addition, in certain circumstances, upon termination of the Memorandum of Understanding, Second Sight would be required to pay a termination fee of up to $1 million to Pixium.\nIf the Business Combination is not completed, Second Sight may be materially adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the Business Combination, will be subject to a number of risks, including the following: the market price of Second Sight shares could decline; if the Memorandum of Understanding is terminated and the Second Sight board seeks another business combination, Second Sight shareholders cannot be certain that Second Sight will be able to find a party willing to enter into a transaction on terms equivalent to or more attractive than the terms that Second Sight has agreed to in the Memorandum of Understanding; time and resources, financial and otherwise, committed by Second Sight\u2019s management to matters relating to the Business Combination could otherwise have been devoted to pursuing other beneficial opportunities; Second Sight may experience negative reactions from the financial markets or employees; and Second Sight will be required to pay its expenses relating to the Business Combination such as legal, accounting and financial advisory fees, whether or not the Business Combination is completed.\nIn addition, if the Business Combination is not completed, Second Sight could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the Business Combination or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against such party to perform its obligations under the Memorandum of Understanding. Any of these risks could materially and adversely impact Second Sight\u2019s ongoing business, financial condition, results of operations and the market price of Second Sight shares. Similarly, delays in the completion of the Business Combination could, among other things, result in additional transaction costs or other negative effects associated with delay and uncertainty about completion of the Business Combination and could materially and adversely impact Second Sight\u2019s ongoing business, financial condition, results of operations and the market price of Second Sight shares.\nThe Share Consideration is not adjustable based on the market price of the common stock of either Second Sight or Pixium but is intended to result in Pixium owning approximately 60% of the resulting combined entity, so the\nShare Consideration at the closing may have a greater or lesser value than at the time that the Memorandum of Understanding was signed.\nUpon completion of the intended Business Combination, Pixium will receive the Share Consideration, which is equal to 34,876,043 fully paid and nonassessable shares of Second Sight common stock. This share amount was fixed in the contribution agreement and the contribution agreement does not allow for this number to be adjusted for changes in the market price of Second Sight common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock has been volatile, especially following the announcement of the Business Combination and it is impossible to accurately predict the market price of Second Sight common stock at the completion of the Business Combination and, therefore, impossible to accurately predict the market price of the shares of Second Sight common stock that Pixium will receive in the Business Combination. The market price for Second Sight common stock may fluctuate both prior to the completion of the Business Combination and thereafter for a variety of reasons, including, among others, general market and economic conditions, changes in laws and regulations, other changes in Second Sight\u2019s and Pixium\u2019s respective businesses, operations, prospects and financial results of operations, market assessments of the likelihood that the Business Combination will be completed, and the expected timing of the Business Combination. Many of these factors are beyond Second Sight\u2019s and Pixium\u2019s control. As a result, the market value represented by the Share Consideration will also vary.\nNeither Second Sight nor Pixium is permitted to terminate the Memorandum of Understanding solely because of changes in the market prices of Second Sight common stock. In addition, the market value of Second Sight common stock (based on the trading price of shares of Second Sight common stock) may vary significantly from the dates of the Second Sight special meeting to the date of the completion of the Business Combination.\nDuring early March 2021, subsequent to signing the Memorandum of Understanding, the market price of Second Sight common stock increased substantially compared both to the price of Second Sight common stock at the time of execution of the Memorandum of Understanding and with the market price of Pixium stock. This disparity, should it continue or increase, may change the way Second Sight shareholders evaluate the business combination and cast doubt as to its ultimate approval. Although holders of approximately 30% of our outstanding common stock have signed voting agreements to support the Pixium transaction, we may spend substantial amounts of money in pursuit of the transaction only to find that it does not receive the required shareholder approval.\nThe combined company may be unable to successfully integrate the business of Pixium and Second Sight or realize the anticipated benefits of the Business Combination.\nThe success of the Business Combination will depend, in part, on the combined company\u2019s ability to successfully combine and integrate the businesses of Pixium and Second Sight, and realize the anticipated benefits, including synergies, cost savings, innovation and technological opportunities and operational efficiencies from the Second Sight in a manner that does not materially disrupt existing supplier and employee relations. The ability of the combined company to realize these anticipated benefits is subject to certain risks, including whether the combined business will perform as expected, the possibility that Second Sight paid more for the assets of Pixium than the value the combined company will derive from the Business Combination and the assumption of known and unknown liabilities of Pixium. If the combined company is unable to achieve these objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the anticipated benefits may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, and the value of the combined company common stock may decline. The combined company may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the Business Combination if the integration process takes longer than expected or is more costly than expected.\nThe integration of the two companies may result in material challenges, including: managing a larger, more complex combined business; managing a business with operations in France and incorporated in the United States, maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees; retaining existing business and operational relationships, including suppliers and employees and other counterparties, as may be impacted by contracts containing consent and/or other provisions that may be triggered by the Business Combination; consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations, including unanticipated issues in integrating financial reporting, information technology infrastructure, data and content management systems and product platforms, communications and other systems; coordinating geographically separate organizations; harmonizing the companies\u2019 operating practices, employee development and compensation programs, internal controls, compliance programs and other policies, procedures and processes; addressing possible differences in\nbusiness backgrounds, corporate cultures and management philosophies; and unforeseen expenses or delays associated with the Business Combination.\nMany of these factors will be outside of Second Sight\u2019s control, and any one of them could result in delays, increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and other adverse impacts, which could materially affect the combined company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. Due to legal restrictions, Pixium and Second Sight are currently permitted to conduct only limited planning for the integration of the two companies following the Business Combination. The actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, and the anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized on a timely basis, if at all.\nThe Memorandum of Understanding contains provisions that limit our ability to pursue alternatives to the Business Combination, could discourage third parties from submitting alternative transaction proposals to us, including proposals that may be superior to the arrangements contemplated by the Memorandum of Understanding, and provide that, in specified circumstances, we would be required to pay a termination fee.\nThe Memorandum of Understanding contains provisions that make it more difficult for Second Sight to be acquired by, or enter into certain combination transactions with, a third party. The Memorandum of Understanding contains certain provisions that restrict Second Sight\u2019s ability to, among other things, solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, or knowingly take any other action designed to facilitate, any alternative transaction, or participate in any discussions or negotiations, or cooperate in any way with any person, with respect to any alternative transaction. In addition, following receipt by Second Sight of any alternative transaction proposal that constitutes a \u201csuperior proposal,\u201d Pixium will have an opportunity to offer to modify the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding before the Second Sight board may withdraw, qualify or modify its recommendation with respect to the Business Combination and related matters, in favor of such superior proposal.\nThese provisions could discourage a potential third-party acquirer or business combination partner that might have an interest in acquiring or combining with all or a significant portion of Second Sight or pursuing an alternative transaction from considering or proposing such a transaction. In some circumstances, upon termination of the Memorandum of Understanding, Second Sight would be required to pay a termination fee of $1 million to Pixium, as contemplated by the Memorandum of Understanding. If the Memorandum of Understanding is terminated and Second Sight determines to seek another business combination transaction, Second Sight may not be able to negotiate a transaction with another party on terms comparable to, or better than, the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding.\nWe are subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Business Combination is pending, which could adversely affect our business and operations.\nIn connection with the pendency of the Business Combination, it is possible that some suppliers, partners and other persons with whom Second Sight has a business relationship may delay or defer certain business decisions or might decide to seek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationships with Second Sight as a result of the Business Combination or otherwise, which could negatively affect Second Sight\u2019s business, as well as the market price of Second Sights shares, regardless of whether the Business Combination is completed. Under the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding, Second Sight is subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of its business prior to completing the Business Combination, which may adversely affect its ability to execute certain of its business strategies, including the ability in certain cases to acquire or dispose of assets or pay dividends or incur capital expenditures above a certain amount. In addition, Second Sight is restricted in its ability in certain cases to enter into or amend contracts, incur indebtedness or settle claims. Such limitations could adversely affect Second Sight\u2019s business and operations prior to the completion of the Business Combination. Each of the risks described above may be exacerbated by delays or other adverse developments with respect to the completion of the Business Combination.\nWe expect to incur substantial expenses related to the completion of the Business Combination and the integration of Pixium\u2019s and our businesses.\nWe expect to incur substantial expenses in connection with the completion of the Business Combination and the integration of a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems of Pixium and Second Sight in connection with the Business Combination. The management of the combined company may face significant challenges in implementing such integration, many of which may be beyond the control of management and which may result in increased costs and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy, as well as materially adversely impact the anticipated synergies of the Business Combination and the business, financial condition and results of operations of the combined company. The integration process and other disruptions resulting from the Business Combination may also adversely affect the combined company\u2019s relationships with employees, suppliers, and others with whom Second Sight and Pixium have business or other dealings, and difficulties in integrating the businesses of Second Sight and Pixium could harm the reputation of the combined company.\nLawsuits may be filed against Second Sight challenging the Business Combination and an adverse ruling in any such lawsuit may prevent the Business Combination from being completed or from being completed within the expected time frame.\nOne of the conditions to the completion of the Business Combination is the absence of any judgment, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation, entered, enacted, promulgated, enforced or issued by any court or other governmental entity of competent jurisdiction or other legal restraint or prohibition in effect preventing the completion of the Business Combination. Accordingly, if litigation is filed challenging the Business Combination and a plaintiff is successful in obtaining an order enjoining completion of the Business Combination, then such order may prevent the Business Combination from being completed or from being completed within the expected time frame.", "PERMNO": 15062, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "EYES"}
