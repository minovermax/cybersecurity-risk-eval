Risk Factors\nWe are subject to various risks and hazards due to the nature of the business activities we conduct. The risks summarized and discussed below, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and the price of our shares, are not the only risks we face. We may experience additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or, as a result of developments occurring in the future, conditions that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nSummary of Risk Factors:\nSet forth below is a summary of the risks more fully described in this Part I, Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

suffer due to over-capacity of certain types of accommodations assets.\n\u25e6Increased operating costs and limited cost recovery through pricing or contract terms may constrain our ability to make a profit.\n\u25e6Employee and customer labor problems could adversely affect us.\n\u25e6A failure to maintain food safety or comply with government regulations related to food and beverages or serving alcoholic beverages may subject us to liability.\n\u25e6The majority of our major Canadian lodges are located on land subject to leases.\n\u25e6We are susceptible to seasonal earnings volatility due to adverse weather conditions in our regions of operations.\n\u25e6Failure to maintain positive relationships with the indigenous people in the areas where we operate could adversely affect our business.\n\u25e6Development of permanent infrastructure in the areas where we locate our assets could negatively impact our business.\n\u25e6We may be subject to risks associated with the transportation and installation of mobile accommodations.\n\u25e6Our business could be negatively impacted by security threats, including cybersecurity threats and other disruptions.\n\u25e6Loss of key members of our management could adversely affect our business.\n\u2022Financial/Accounting Risks\n\u25e6Our indebtedness could restrict our operations and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions.\n\u25e6Currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our U.S. dollar reported results of operations and financial position.\n\u25e6The cyclical nature of our business and a severe prolonged downturn has and could in the future negatively affect the value of our long-lived assets and our goodwill.\n\u25e6Our inability to control the inherent risks of identifying, acquiring and integrating businesses that we may acquire could adversely affect our operations.\n\u25e6We may not have adequate insurance for potential liabilities and insurance may not cover certain liabilities.\n\u2022Legal and Regulatory Risks\n\u25e6We do business in Canada and Australia, whose political and regulatory environments and compliance regimes differ from those in the United States.\n\u25e6We are subject to extensive and costly environmental laws and regulations.\n\u25e6We may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change.\n\u25e6An

our common shares may be volatile.\n\u25e6The rights of holders of our common shares are subordinate to the rights of the holders of our preferred shares.\n\u25e6We are governed by the corporate laws in British Columbia, Canada.\n\u25e6Provisions contained in our articles and applicable Canadian and British Columbia laws could discourage a take-over attempt.\n\u25e6The enforcement of civil liabilities against Civeo may be more difficult.\n\u2022Risks Related to Our Structure\n\u25e6We are subject to various Canadian and other taxes.\n\u25e6We remain subject to changes in tax law (in various jurisdictions) and other factors that could impact our effective tax rate.\n\u25e6The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) may disagree with our conclusions on tax treatment.\n\u25e6Future potential changes to U.S. tax laws could result in Civeo being treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nRisk Factors:\nRisks Related to Our Macroeconomic-Business Environment\nCertain of our customers\u2019 spending may be directly, and our business may be indirectly, affected by volatile or low oil, coal or natural gas prices or unsuccessful exploration results.\nDemand for our services is sensitive to the level of exploration, development and production activity of, and the corresponding capital spending by, oil and gas and mining companies. Our business typically supports customer projects that are capital intensive and require several years to generate first production with production lasting for decades. The economic analyses conducted by our customers in oil sands, Australian mining and liquefied natural gas (LNG) investment areas have historically assumed a relatively conservative longer-term price outlook for production from such projects to determine economic viability. The oil and gas and mining industries\u2019 willingness to explore, develop and produce depends largely upon the availability of attractive resource prospects and the prevailing view of future commodity prices, and expenditures by our oil and gas and mining customers generally lag changes in commodity prices by three to six months. However, with the extreme global oil demand destruction in 2020 due to the COVID-19 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, our oil and gas customers in North America have changed their spending and production plans and have reduced or deferred, and may continue to reduce or defer, major expenditures.\nPrices for oil, metallurgical (met) coal, LNG, natural gas and other natural resources are subject to large fluctuations in response to changes in supply of and demand for these commodities. For the past several years, commodity prices have remained relatively low, and continue to be volatile. Global oil prices dropped to historically low levels in April 2020 due to severely reduced global oil demand, the resulting high global crude inventory levels, uncertainty around timing and slope of worldwide economic recovery after COVID-19 related economic shut-downs and effectiveness of production cuts by major oil producing countries, such as Saudi Arabia, Russia and the U.S. Other factors beyond our control that affect commodity prices include:\n\u2022worldwide economic activity including growth in, and demand for oil, coal and other natural resources, particularly from developing countries, such as China and India;\n\u2022the level of activity and natural resource developments in Australia and the Canadian oil sands;\n\u2022the level of global oil and gas exploration and production and the impact of government regulation or Organization of Petroleum Exporting Companies (OPEC) policies that impact production levels and oil prices;\n\u2022the availability of transportation infrastructure and refining capacity for oil, natural gas, LNG and coal;\n\u2022global weather conditions, natural disasters and global health concerns such as the COVID-19 pandemic or any future disaster or pandemic;\n\u2022rapid technological change and the timing and extent of energy resource development, including hydraulic fracturing of horizontally drilled wells in shale discoveries and LNG;\n\u2022development, commercialization and availability of alternative fuels; and\n\u2022government, tax and environmental regulation, including climate change legislation and clean energy policies.\nIn 2018, the Government of Alberta announced it would mandate temporary curtailments of the province\u2019s oil production. However, monthly production limits were put on hold in December 2020 until further notice, allowing operators to produce freely at their discretion while the government monitors production. Should forecasts show storage inventories approaching maximum capacity, the government may reintroduce production limits. The curtailment initially resulted in a narrowing of the discount (WCS Differential) at which Western Canadian Select (WCS) trades relative to West Texas Intermediate (WTI) in December 2018, which increased in 2019 before narrowing again in the first quarter of 2020. As of February 22, 2021, the WTI price was $61.49 and the WCS price was $49.95, resulting in a WCS Differential of $11.54. Should the price of WTI decline or the WCS discount to WTI widen further, our oil sands customers may delay or eliminate additional investments, further reduce their spending in the oil sands region or curtail or shut-down additional existing operations.\nWe have been adversely affected by the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 has adversely impacted and continues to impact worldwide economic activity, including the natural resources industry in Canada, Australia and the U.S. The actions taken to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and the risk of infection have altered, and are expected to continue to alter, governmental and private-sector policies and behaviors in ways that have had a significant negative effect on oil consumption, such as government-imposed or voluntary social distancing and quarantining, stay-at-home orders, health and safety considerations, reduced travel and remote work policies. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, some resulting disruptions and increased costs to our business as a result of the measures we have set in place to comply with governmental regulations and customer policies related to COVID-19. In addition, with lower and volatile oil prices due to reduced global oil demand and uncertainty around the continued economic impact of COVID-19, capital spending by oil and gas companies and customer demand for our services has been adversely affected. The ultimate extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend largely on future developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak in the countries in which we operate and the related impact on the oil and gas industry, the impact of governmental actions designed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and the development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with certainty at this time.\nRisks Related to Our Customers\nOur customers and their operations are exposed to a number of unique operating risks and challenges which could also adversely affect us.\nWe could be materially adversely affected by disruptions to our customers\u2019 operations. The price of and demand for natural resources produced by our customers may impact their desire and/or ability to continue existing projects or start new projects. Customers may also experience unexpected problems, higher costs or delays in commencing or developing a project. Operating risks and challenges our customers face, which may ultimately affect their need for the accommodations and services we provide, include:\n\u2022commodity price volatility;\n\u2022unforeseen and adverse geological, geotechnical, seismic and mining conditions;\n\u2022lack of availability or failure of the required infrastructure, including sourcing sufficient water or power, necessary to maintain or to expand their operations;\n\u2022the breakdown or shortage of equipment and labor necessary to maintain their operations;\n\u2022risks associated with the natural resources industry being subject to various regulatory approvals, including a government agency failing to grant an approval or failing to renew an existing approval, or the approval or renewal not being provided by the government agency in a timely manner or the government agency granting or renewing an approval subject to materially onerous conditions;\n\u2022risks to land titles, mining titles and use thereof as a result of native title claims;\n\u2022claims by persons living in close proximity to mining projects, which may have an impact on the consents granted; and\n\u2022interruptions to the operations of our customers caused by governmental action, industrial accidents, disputes or public health emergencies.\nWe depend on several significant customers.\nWe depend on several significant customers, including customers that operate in the oil and gas and mining industries, which has been adversely impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The loss of any one of our largest customers in any of our business segments or a sustained decrease in demand by any of such customers could result in a substantial loss of revenues and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, the concentration of customers in the mining and oil and gas industries may impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic and industry conditions. With the current low and volatile oil and gas prices, some of our customers may face liquidity issues, which could impair their ability to pay or otherwise perform on their obligations. Furthermore, some of our customers may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating and regulatory risks, which increases the risk that they may default on their obligations to us. For a more detailed explanation of our customers, see \u201cBusiness\u201d in Item 1 of this annual report.\nOur failure to retain our current customers, renew our existing customer contracts and obtain new customer contracts, or the termination of existing contracts, could adversely affect our business.\nOur success depends on our ability to retain our current customers, renew or replace our existing customer contracts and obtain new business. Our ability to do so generally depends on a variety of factors, including overall customer expenditure levels and the quality, price and responsiveness of our services, as well as our ability to market these services effectively and differentiate ourselves from our competitors. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain new business, renew existing customer contracts at the same or higher levels of pricing, or at all, or that our current customers will not turn to competitors, cease operations, elect to self-operate or terminate contracts with us.\nOur business is contract intensive and we are party to many contracts with customers. Due to the current volatile commodity price environment, our customers may not renew contracts on terms favorable to us or, in some cases, at all, and we may have difficulty obtaining new business. Several contracts have clauses that allow termination upon the payment of a termination fee. As a result, our customers may choose to terminate their contracts. The likelihood that a customer may seek to terminate a contract is increased during periods of market volatility like those we are currently experiencing. Finally, while we periodically review our compliance with contract terms and provisions, if customers were to dispute our contract determinations, the resolution of such disputes in a manner adverse to our interests, including customers withholding payments or modification of payment terms, could negatively affect sales and operating results. Customer contract cancellations, the failure to renew a significant number of our existing contracts or the failure to obtain new business would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nDue to the significant geographic concentration of our business, adverse events in areas where we operate could negatively impact our business, and our geographic concentration could limit the number of customers seeking our services.\nBecause of the concentration of our business in the oil sands region of Alberta, Canada and in the coal producing, Bowen Basin region of Queensland, Australia, two relatively small geographic areas, we have increased exposure to political, regulatory, environmental, labor, climate or natural disasters such as forest fires or flooding, events or developments that could disproportionately impact our operations and financial results. For example, in 2011 and 2017, cyclones and resulting flooding threatened our villages in Australia. Also in 2011 and 2016, forest fires in northern Alberta impacted areas near our Canadian oil sands lodges. Due to our geographic concentration, any adverse events or developments in our operating areas may disproportionately affect our financial results.\nIn addition, a limited number of potential customers operate in the areas in which our business is concentrated, and occupancy at each of our lodges may be constrained by the radius which potential customers are willing to transport their workers. Our geographic concentration could limit the number of customers seeking our services, and as to any single lodge or village, we may have few potential customers. Therefore, we are subject to volatility in occupancy in any location based on the capital spending plans of a limited number of customers, based on their changing decisions as to whether to outsource or use their own company-owned accommodations and whether other potential customers move into that lodge\u2019s radius.\nWe may be adversely affected if customers reduce their accommodations outsourcing.\nOur business and growth strategies depend in large part on customers outsourcing some or all of the services that we provide. Many oil and gas and mining companies in our core markets own their own accommodations facilities, while others outsource all or part of their accommodations requirements. Customers have largely built their own accommodations in the past but will outsource if they perceive that outsourcing may provide quality services at a lower overall cost or allow them to\naccelerate the timing of their projects. We cannot be certain that these customer preferences will continue or that customers that have previously outsourced accommodations will not decide to perform these functions themselves or only outsource accommodations during the development or construction phases of their projects. In addition, labor unions representing customer employees and contractors have, in the past, opposed outsourcing accommodations to the extent that the unions believe that third-party accommodations negatively impact union membership and recruiting. The reversal or reduction in customer outsourcing of accommodations could negatively impact our financial results and growth prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry, and if we fail to compete effectively, our business will suffer.\nThe workforce accommodations and hospitality industry in which we operate is highly competitive. To be successful, we must provide hospitality services that meet the specific needs of our customers at competitive prices. The principal competitive factors in the markets in which we operate are service quality and availability, price, technical knowledge and experience and safety performance. We compete with international and regional competitors, several of which are significantly larger than we. These competitors offer similar services in the geographic regions in which we operate. Many oil and gas and mining companies in our core markets own their own accommodations facilities and outsource their service requirements, while others outsource all or part of their accommodations requirements. As a result of competition, we may be unable to continue to provide our present services, to provide such services at historical operating margins or to acquire additional business opportunities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Reduced levels of activity in the workforce accommodation industry can intensify competition and result in lower revenue to us.\nOur operations may suffer due to over-capacity of certain types of accommodations assets.\nThe demand for and/or pricing of rooms and accommodation services is subject to the overall availability of rooms in the marketplace. If demand for our assets were to decrease, or to the extent that we and our competitors increase our capacity in excess of current demand, we may encounter decreased pricing for, or utilization of, our assets and services, which could adversely impact our operations and profits. The economic disruption in 2020 caused by the decline in the price of and demand for oil has impacted the activity in the Canadian oil sands and our U.S. business, and we have seen decreased customer demand for accommodations in those areas, and we have experienced a corresponding significant decrease in our occupancy and profitability.\nIncreased operating costs and limited cost recovery through pricing or contract terms may constrain our ability to make a profit.\nOur profitability can be adversely affected to the extent we are faced with cost increases for food, wages and other labor related expenses, insurance, fuel and utilities, especially to the extent we are unable to recover such increased costs through increases in the prices for our services, due to one or more of general economic conditions, competitive conditions or contractual provisions in our customer contracts. Substantial increases in the cost of fuel and utilities have historically resulted in cost increases in our lodges and villages. From time to time we have experienced increases in our food costs. While we believe a portion of these increases were attributable to fuel prices, we believe the increases also resulted from rising global food demand. In addition, food prices can fluctuate as a result of foreign exchange rates and temporary changes in supply, including as a result of incidences of wildfires or severe weather such as droughts, heavy rains and late freezes, or other climate effects. While our multi-year contracts often provide for annual escalation in our room rates for food, labor and utility inflation, we may be unable to fully recover costs and such increases would negatively impact our profitability on contracts that do not contain such inflation protections.\nEmployee and customer labor problems could adversely affect us.\nOur business is labor intensive requiring a significant number of employees to perform housekeeping, janitorial and food services at our locations or locations that we manage. As our operations grow or our occupancy increases, we require additional staff to take care of our guests at a standard we deem appropriate and to operate safely. If we are unable to hire a sufficient labor force, we may be required to increase wages or use temporary labor at a higher cost and reduced efficiency. Inefficient operations or higher labor costs would negatively impact our profitability and could damage our reputation with our customers.\nAdditionally, as of December 31, 2020, we were party to collective bargaining agreements covering 885 employees in Canada and 588 employees in Australia. Efforts have been made from time to time to unionize other portions of our workforce. In addition, our facilities serving oil sands development work in Northern Alberta, Canada and mining operations in Australia\nhouse both union and non-union customer employees. We have not experienced strikes, work stoppages or other slowdowns in the past, but we cannot guarantee that we will not experience such events in the future. A prolonged strike, work stoppage or other slowdown by our employees or by the employees of our customers could cause us to experience a disruption of our operations, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Additional unionization efforts and new collective bargaining agreements also could materially increase our costs or limit our flexibility. Collective bargaining agreements in our Canadian operations have individual expiration dates, but in no case extend beyond 2023. Enterprise bargaining agreements in our Australian operations cover certain employees working at our villages in Queensland, New South Wales and Western Australia, as well as certain employees working at our integrated services customer owned sites in Western Australia. These agreements have individual expiration dates, but in no case extend beyond 2022.\nA failure to maintain food safety or comply with government regulations related to food and beverages or serving alcoholic beverages may subject us to liability.\nClaims of illness or injury relating to food quality or food handling are common in the food service industry, and a number of these claims may exist at any given time. Because food safety issues could be experienced at the source or by food suppliers or distributors, food safety could, in part, be out of our control. Regardless of the source or cause, any report of food-borne illness or other food safety issues such as food tampering or contamination at one of our locations could adversely impact our reputation, hindering our ability to renew contracts on favorable terms or to obtain new business, and have a negative impact on our sales. Future food product recalls and health concerns associated with food contamination may also increase our raw materials costs and, from time to time, disrupt our business.\nA variety of regulations at various governmental levels relating to the handling, preparation and serving of food (including, in some cases, requirements relating to the temperature of food), cleanliness of food production facilities and hygiene of food-handling personnel are enforced primarily at the local public health department level. We can give no assurances that we are in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations at all times or that we will be able to comply with any future laws and regulations. Furthermore, legislation and regulatory attention to food safety is very high. Additional or amended regulations in this area may significantly increase the cost of compliance or expose us to liabilities.\nWe serve alcoholic beverages at some of our facilities, and must comply with applicable licensing laws, as well as local service laws. These laws generally prohibit serving alcoholic beverages to certain persons such as a patron who is intoxicated or a minor. If we violate these laws, we may be liable to the patron and/or third parties for the acts of the patron. We cannot guarantee that certain patrons will not be served or that liability for their acts will not be imposed on us. There can be no assurance that additional regulation in this area would not limit our activities in the future or significantly increase the cost of regulatory compliance. We must also obtain and comply with the terms of licenses in order to sell alcoholic beverages in the jurisdictions in which we serve alcoholic beverages. If we are unable to maintain food safety or comply with government regulations related to food, beverages or alcoholic beverages, the effect could be materially adverse to our business and results of operations.\nThe majority of our major Canadian lodges are located on land subject to leases. If we are unable to renew a lease or obtain permits necessary to operate on such leased land, we could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe majority of our major Canadian lodges are located on land subject to provincial leases. Accordingly, while we own the accommodations assets, we only own a leasehold in those properties. If we are found to be in breach of a lease, we could lose the right to use the property. In addition, our leases generally have an initial term of ten years and will expire between 2022 and 2028 unless extended. Unless we can extend the terms of these leases before their expiration, as to which no assurance can be given, we will lose our right to operate our facilities located on these properties upon expiration of the leases. In that event, we would be required to remove our accommodations assets and remediate the site. As of December 31, 2020, we had an asset retirement obligation (ARO) liability on our balance sheet of $15.0 million. Consistent with US GAAP, this liability is the estimated present value of the amount of required asset removal and site remediation costs related to the retirement of assets at these locations. Should the remediation requirement be accelerated, our near term cash obligation could be significantly larger than the liability currently on our balance sheet and could negatively impact our cash flows and liquidity.\nAlso, in certain areas in which we operate, we are required to seek permits from local government agencies in order to build a new lodge or operate an existing lodge on leased land. A proposed regulation in a Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo, Alberta, where we have eight facilities, would require us to seek renewal of such permits every four years; however, this proposal was abandoned in late 2019, and no update has been provided. We can provide no assurances that we will be able to renew our leases or permits upon expiration on similar terms, or at all. If we are unable to renew our leases or permits on similar terms, it may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe are susceptible to seasonal earnings volatility due to adverse weather conditions in our regions of operations.\nOur operations are directly affected by seasonal differences in weather in the areas in which we operate, most notably in Canada and Australia, and, to a lesser extent, the Permian Basin. A portion of our Canadian operations is conducted during the winter months when the winter freeze in remote regions is required for exploration and production activity to occur. The spring thaw in these frontier regions restricts operations in the spring months and, as a result, adversely affects our operations and our ability to provide services in the second and, to a lesser extent, third quarters. During the Australian rainy season, generally between the months of November and April, our operations in Queensland and the northern parts of Western Australia can be affected by cyclones, monsoons and resultant flooding. Severe winter weather conditions in the Permian Basin of the United States can restrict access to work areas for our customers. Furthermore, the areas in which we operate are susceptible to wildfires, which could interrupt our operations and adversely impact our earnings.\nFailure to maintain positive relationships with the indigenous people in the areas where we operate could adversely affect our business.\nA component of our business strategy is based on developing and maintaining positive relationships with the indigenous people and communities in the areas where we operate. These relationships are important to our operations and customers who desire to work on traditional indigenous lands. The inability to develop and maintain relationships and to be in compliance with local requirements could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nDevelopment of permanent infrastructure in the areas where we locate our assets could negatively impact our business.\nWe specialize in providing hospitality services for workforces in remote areas which often lack the infrastructure typically available in nearby towns and cities. If permanent towns, cities and municipal infrastructure develop, grow or otherwise become available in the oil sands region of northern Alberta, Canada, the west coast of British Columbia or regions of Australia where we locate villages, then demand for our hospitality services could decrease as customer employees move to the region and choose to utilize permanent housing and food services.\nWe may be subject to risks associated with the transportation and installation of mobile accommodations.\nIn connection with our Canadian and U.S. businesses, we currently have several contracts to transport and install modular, skid-mounted accommodations and central facilities that can be quickly configured to serve a multitude of short to medium-term accommodation needs. In connection with the transportation and installation of these facilities, we may be exposed to various risks, including\n\u2022delays in necessary approvals to install the facilities or objections to our activities or those of our customers aired by aboriginal or community interests, environment and/or neighborhood groups which may cause delays in the granting of such approvals and/or the overall progress of a project;\n\u2022challenges during installation, including problems, defects, inclement weather conditions, land contamination, cultural heritage claims, difficult site access or industrial relations issues; and\n\u2022risks related to the quality of our materials and workmanship, including warranties and defect liability obligations.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by security threats, including cybersecurity threats and other disruptions.\nWe face various security threats, including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable or hold them for ransom; threats to the safety of our employees; threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure or third-party facilities and infrastructure; and threats from terrorist acts. Although we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor these threats and mitigate our exposure to such threats, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient in preventing security threats from materializing. If any of these events were to materialize, they could lead to losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure, personnel or capabilities essential to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nCybersecurity attacks in particular are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, ransomware attacks and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of or denial of access to confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. In 2018, we experienced a minor data security breach resulting from unauthorized access to our systems, which had no material impact on our operations; however, there is no assurance that such impacts will not be material in the future.\nLoss of key members of our management could adversely affect our business.\nWe depend on the continued employment and performance of key members of our management. If any of our key managers resign or become unable to continue in their present roles and are not adequately replaced, our business operations could be materially adversely affected. We do not maintain \u201ckey man\u201d life insurance for any of our officers.\nFinancial/Accounting Risks\nOur indebtedness could restrict our operations and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions.\nWe currently have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $187.5 million outstanding under the term loan portion of our credit agreement (as amended from time to time, the Amended Credit Agreement), $63.6 million outstanding under the revolving portion of the Amended Credit Agreement, $4.5 million of outstanding letters of credit and capacity to borrow an additional $99.3 million under the revolving portion of the Amended Credit Agreement. If market or other economic conditions remain depressed or further deteriorate, our borrowing capacity may be further reduced.\nOur Amended Credit Agreement contains, and any future indebtedness we incur may contain, a number of restrictive covenants that will impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to, among other things, borrow funds, dispose of assets, pay dividends and make certain investments. In addition, these covenants also may limit our ability to obtain future financings, make needed capital expenditures, withstand a continued downturn in our business or a downturn in the economy in general or otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. Declines in commodity prices, or a prolonged period of commodity prices at depressed levels, could eventually result in our failing to meet one or more of the financial covenants under the Amended Credit Agreement, which could require us to refinance or amend such obligations resulting in the payment of consent fees or higher interest rates, or require us to raise additional capital at an inopportune time or on terms not favorable to us.\nA failure to comply with these covenants, ratios or tests could also result in an event of default. A default under the Amended Credit Agreement, if not cured or waived, could result in acceleration of all indebtedness outstanding thereunder. The accelerated debt would become immediately due and payable. If that should occur, we may be unable to pay all such debt or to borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if new financing were then available, it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us. In addition, in the event of an event of default under the Amended Credit Agreement, the lenders could foreclose on the collateral securing the credit facility and require repayment of all borrowings outstanding. If the amounts outstanding under the credit facility or any of our other indebtedness were to be accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full the money owed to the lenders or to our other debt holders. Moreover, any new indebtedness we incur may impose financial restrictions and other covenants on us that may be more restrictive than our existing debt agreements.\nOur ability to service our debt, including repaying outstanding borrowings under our Amended Credit Agreement at maturity, will depend upon, among other things, our future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flows from operations to enable us to meet our obligations under our indebtedness, we will be forced to take actions such as reducing or delaying business activities, acquisitions, investments and/or capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness or seeking additional equity capital. We may not be able to effect any of these remedies on satisfactory terms or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our U.S. dollar reported results of operations and financial position.\nOur reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, and we are exposed to currency exchange risk primarily between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian and Australian dollars. For the year ended December 31, 2020, 95% of our revenues originated from subsidiaries outside of the U.S. and were denominated in either the Canadian dollar or the Australian dollar. As a result, a material decrease in the value of these currencies relative to the U.S. dollar has had, and may have in the future, a negative impact on our reported revenues, net income, financial condition and cash flows. Any currency controls implemented by local monetary authorities in countries where we currently operate could also adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may attempt to limit the risks of currency fluctuation where possible by entering into financial instruments to protect against foreign currency exposure, but, to date, we have not entered into any foreign currency financial\ninstruments. Our efforts to limit exchange risks may be unsuccessful, thereby exposing us to foreign currency fluctuations that could cause our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows to deteriorate.\nThe cyclical nature of our business and a severe prolonged downturn has, and could in the future, negatively affect the value of our long-lived assets and our goodwill.\nWe recorded impairments of our long-lived assets of $50.5 million, $6.2 million and $28.7 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We also recorded goodwill impairments of $93.6 million and $19.9 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, goodwill at our Australian reporting unit represented 1% of total assets, or $8.7 million.\nFactors that may cause us to recognize further impairment losses on our long-lived assets or on the goodwill at our Australian reporting unit include, among other things, extended periods of limited or no activity by our customers at our lodges or villages, increased or unanticipated competition, and downward forecast revisions or restructuring plans or if certain of our customers do not reach positive final investment decisions on projects with respect to which we have been awarded contracts to provide related accommodation, which may cause those customers to terminate the contracts.\nOur inability to control the inherent risks of identifying, acquiring and integrating businesses that we may acquire, including any related increases in debt or issuances of equity securities, could adversely affect our operations.\nAcquisitions have been, and our management believes acquisitions will continue to be, a key element of our growth strategy. We may not be able to identify and acquire acceptable acquisition candidates on favorable terms in the future. We may be required to incur substantial indebtedness to finance future acquisitions and also may issue equity securities in connection with such acquisitions. Such additional debt service requirements could impose a significant burden on our results of operations and financial condition. The issuance of additional equity securities could result in significant dilution to shareholders. In addition, overpayment of an acquisition could cause potential impairments which could affect our results of operations.\nWe expect to gain certain business, financial and strategic advantages as a result of business combinations we undertake, including synergies and operating efficiencies. Our forward-looking statements assume that we will successfully integrate our business acquisitions and realize these intended benefits. The success of any acquisitions we make depends, in large part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits, including operating synergies from combining our businesses, which were previously operated independently, and retaining and integrating key employees, vendors and customers from the acquired businesses. An inability to realize expected strategic advantages as a result of the acquisition would negatively affect the anticipated benefits of the acquisition.\nAdditionally, an acquisition may bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different from those we have previously experienced. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to manage this expanded business, which will pose substantial challenges for our management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity. If we fail to manage any of these risks successfully, our business could be harmed. Our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly following an acquisition, and our shareholders may not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in evaluating future acquisitions.\nWe may not have adequate insurance for potential liabilities and insurance may not cover certain liabilities.\nOur operations are subject to many hazards. In the ordinary course of business, we become the subject of various claims, lawsuits and administrative proceedings seeking damages or other remedies concerning our commercial operations, products, employees and other matters, including occasional claims by individuals alleging exposure to hazardous materials as a result of our products or operations. Some of these claims relate to the activities of businesses that we have acquired, even though these activities may have occurred prior to our acquisition of such businesses. We maintain insurance to cover many of our potential losses, including cyber risk insurance, and we are subject to various self-retentions and deductibles under our insurance policies. It is possible, however, that a judgment could be rendered against us in cases in which we could be uninsured and beyond the amounts that we currently have reserved or anticipate incurring for such matters. Even a partially uninsured or underinsured claim, if successful and of significant size, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or consolidated financial position. In addition, we are insured under the insurance policies of Oil States International, Inc. (Oil States) for occurrences prior to the completion of our spin-off from Oil States in May 2014 (the Spin-Off). The specifications and insured limits under those policies, however, may be insufficient for such claims. We also face other risks related to our insurance coverage, including (1) we may not be able to continue to obtain insurance on commercially reasonable terms; (2) the counterparties to our insurance contracts may pose credit risks; and (3) we may incur losses from interruption of our business that exceed our insurance coverage\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nWe do business in Canada and Australia, whose political and regulatory environments and compliance regimes differ from those in the United States.\nA significant portion of our revenue is attributable to operations in Canada and Australia. These activities accounted for 95% of our consolidated revenue in the year ended December 31, 2020. Risks associated with our operations in Canada and Australia include, but are not limited to, (1) different taxing regimes; (2) changing political conditions at the federal, provincial or state level; (3) changing international and U.S. monetary policies; and (4) regional economic downturns.\nThe regulatory regimes in these countries are substantially different than those in the United States, and may be unfamiliar to U.S. investors. Violations of non-U.S. laws could result in monetary and criminal penalties against us or our subsidiaries and could damage our reputation and, therefore, our ability to do business.\nWe are subject to extensive and costly environmental laws and regulations that may require us to take actions that will adversely affect our results of operations.\nAll of our operations are significantly affected by stringent and complex foreign, federal, provincial, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of substances into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. We could be exposed to liabilities for cleanup costs, natural resource damages and other damages as a result of our conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior operators or other third-parties. Environmental laws and regulations are subject to change in the future, possibly resulting in more stringent requirements. The implementation of new laws and regulations could result in materially increased costs, stricter standards and enforcement, larger fines and liability and increased capital expenditures and operating costs, particularly for our customers, and could have an adverse effect on our business or demand for our services. See Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Government Regulation\u201d of this annual report for a more detailed description of our risks associated with environmental laws and regulations. It should also be noted that scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other climatic events.\nAny failure by us to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations may result in governmental authorities taking actions against our business that could adversely impact our business and results of operations, including the issuance of administrative, civil and criminal penalties; denial or revocation of permits or other authorizations; reduction or cessation of operations; and performance of site investigatory, remedial or other corrective actions.\nWe may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change.\nClimate change is receiving increasing attention from the media, scientists and legislators alike which has resulted in legislative, regulatory and other initiatives, including international agreements, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide and methane. Significant focus is being made on companies that are active producers of fossil fuels, or companies which serve such producers.\nEfforts have been made and continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues and impose reductions of hydrocarbon-based fuels, including plans developed in connection with the Paris climate conference in December 2015 and the Katowice climate conference in December 2018. There are a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to address greenhouse gas emissions, including increased fuel efficiency standards, carbon taxes or cap and trade systems, restrictive permitting, and incentives for renewable energy, which are in various phases of discussion or implementation. Moreover, such legislation, regulations and proposals are subject to frequent change by regulatory authorities, including in connection with the change in the U.S. federal administration in January 2021. The outcome of Canadian, Australian and U.S. federal, regional, provincial and state actions to address global climate change could result in a variety of regulatory programs including potential new regulations, additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities, or other regulatory actions. These actions could both (1) directly impact us due to increased costs associated with our operations, and (2) indirectly impact us due to increased costs of and/or reduced demand for our customers' operations, and resulting reduced demand for our services.\nAny adoption of these or similar proposals by Canadian, Australian, U.S. federal, regional, provincial or state governments mandating a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions could have far-reaching and significant impacts on the energy industry, including negatively impacting the price of oil relative to other energy sources, reducing demand for hydrocarbons and other minerals or limiting drilling or mining in the areas in which we operate. Although it is not possible at\nthis time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, and could have a material adverse effect on our business or demand for our services. In addition, there have also been efforts in recent years to influence the investment community, including investment advisors and certain sovereign wealth, pension and endowment funds promoting divestment of fossil fuel equities and pressuring lenders to limit funding to companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves. Such environmental activism and initiatives aimed at limiting climate change and reducing air pollution could interfere with our business activities, operations and ability to access capital. See Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Government Regulation\u201d of this annual report for a more detailed description of our climate-change related risks.\nAn accidental release of pollutants into the environment may cause us to incur significant costs and liabilities.\nThere is inherent risk of environmental costs and liabilities in our business as a result of (1) our handling of petroleum hydrocarbons, (2) air emissions and waste water discharges related to our operations, and (3) historical industry operations and waste disposal practices. Certain environmental statutes impose joint and several strict liability for these costs. For example, an accidental release by us in the performance of services at one of our or our customers\u2019 sites could subject us to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup, restoration costs and natural resource damages, claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage and fines or penalties for related violations of environmental laws or regulations. We may not be able to recover some or any of these costs from insurance.\nRisks Related to Our Common Shares\nThe market price and trading volume of our common shares may be volatile.\nOn November 19, 2020, we effected the Reverse Share Split, where each twelve issued and outstanding common shares were converted into one common share. Our common shares began trading on a reverse share split-adjusted basis on November 19, 2020. All common share and per common share data included in this annual report have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Reverse Share Split.\nThe market price of our common shares has historically experienced and may continue to experience volatility. For example, during 2019, the market price of our common shares, adjusted to reflect the Reverse Share Split, ranged from a low of $9.01 per share to a high of $34.20 per share. During 2020, the market price of our common shares, adjusted to reflect the Reverse Share Split, ranged from a low of $4.08 per share to a high of $18.48 per share. The market price of our common shares may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including those described above and the following:\n\u2022changes in financial estimates by analysts and our inability to meet those financial estimates;\n\u2022strategic actions by us or our competitors;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, joint marketing relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022variations in our quarterly operating results and those of our competitors;\n\u2022general economic and stock market conditions;\n\u2022risks related to our business and our industry, including those discussed above;\n\u2022changes in conditions or trends in our industry, markets or customers;\n\u2022terrorist acts;\n\u2022future sales of our common shares or other securities by us, members of our management team or our existing shareholders; and\n\u2022investor perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with our industry or common shares relative to other investment alternatives.\nThese broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common shares, regardless of our operating performance. In addition, price volatility may be greater if the public float and trading volume of our common shares is low.\nIn addition, in recent years the stock market has experienced substantial price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons potentially unrelated to their operating performance. For example, our share price may experience substantial volatility due to uncertainty regarding commodity prices. These market fluctuations, regardless of the cause, may materially and adversely affect our share price, regardless of our operating results. Furthermore, the trading market for our common shares is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of\nour company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nThe rights of holders of our common shares are subordinate to the rights of the holders of our preferred shares.\nThe holders of the preferred shares issued in the Noralta Acquisition have rights and preferences superior to those of the holders of our common shares, including the right to receive a 2% annual dividend, paid quarterly in cash or, at our option, by increasing the preferred shares\u2019 liquidation preference, or any combination thereof and the right to receive a liquidation preference prior to any distribution of our assets to the holders of our common shares. In addition, holders of the preferred shares may convert their shares into common shares at an initial conversion price of $39.60 per common share, which may not be the fair market value of such shares at the time of conversion.\nWe are governed by the corporate laws in British Columbia, Canada which in some cases have a different effect on shareholders than the corporate laws in Delaware, United States.\nThere are material differences between the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) (BCBCA) as compared to the Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL). For example, some of these material differences include the following: (a) for material corporate transactions (such as amalgamations, arrangements, the sale of all or substantially all of our undertaking, and other extraordinary corporate transactions), the BCBCA, subject to the provisions of our Articles, generally requires two-thirds majority vote by shareholders, whereas DGCL generally only requires a majority vote of shareholders for similar material corporate transactions; and (b) under the BCBCA, a holder of 5% or more of our common shares can requisition a general meeting of shareholders for the purpose of transacting any business that may be transacted at a general meeting, whereas the DGCL does not give this right. We cannot predict if investors will find our common shares less attractive because of these material differences. If some investors find our common shares less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common shares and our share price may be more volatile.\nProvisions contained in our articles and applicable Canadian and British Columbia laws could discourage a take-over attempt, which may reduce or eliminate the likelihood of a change of control transaction and, therefore, the ability of our shareholders to sell their shares for a premium.\nProvisions contained in our articles provide for a classified board of directors, limitations on the removal of directors, limitations on shareholder proposals at meetings of shareholders and limitations on shareholder action by written consent, which could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire control of us. Our articles, subject to the corporate law of British Columbia, also authorize our board of directors to issue series of preferred shares without shareholder approval. If our board of directors elects to issue preferred shares, it could increase the difficulty for a third-party to acquire us, which may reduce or eliminate our shareholders\u2019 ability to sell their common shares at a premium. In addition, in Canada, we may become subject to applicable securities laws, including National Instrument 62-104 Take-Over Bids and Issuer Bids of the Canadian Securities Administrators, which provide a heightened threshold for shareholder acceptance of third-party acquisition offers and could discourage take-over attempts that could result in a premium over the market price for our common shares.\nAs a British Columbia company, we may be subject to additional Canadian laws and regulations. The application of additional Canadian laws and regulations could make it more difficult for third parties to acquire control of us. For example, such laws and regulations may, depending on the circumstances, result in regulatory reviews of and may require regulatory approval for any proposed take-over attempts.\nAny of the foregoing could prevent or delay a change of control and may deprive or limit strategic opportunities for our shareholders to sell their common shares and/or affect the market price of our common shares.\nThe enforcement of civil liabilities against Civeo may be more difficult.\nCiveo is a British Columbia company and a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the U.S. As a result, investors could experience more difficulty enforcing judgments obtained against us in U.S. courts than would be the case for U.S. judgments obtained against a U.S. company. In addition, some claims may be more difficult to bring against Civeo in Canadian courts than it would be to bring similar claims against a U.S. company in a U.S. court.\nRisks Related to Our Structure\nWe are subject to various Canadian and other taxes.\nOur effective tax rates (including our Canadian tax rate) are dependent on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our ability to control, such as changes in the rate of economic growth in Canada, currency exchange rate fluctuations (especially between Canadian and U.S. dollars), and significant changes in trade, monetary or fiscal policies of Canada, including changes in interest rates, withholding taxes, tax treaties and federal and provincial tax rates generally. The impact of these factors, individually and in the aggregate, is difficult to predict, in part because the occurrence of any number of the events or circumstances described in such factors may be (and, in fact, often seem to be) interrelated, and the impact to us of the occurrence of any one of these events or circumstances could be compounded or, alternatively, reduced, offset, or more than offset, by the occurrence of one or more of the other events or circumstances described in such factors.\nCanada\u2019s tax rules under the Income Tax Act (Canada) (the Canadian Tax Act) allow for favorable tax treatment insofar as the repatriation of certain dividends from foreign affiliates. These tax rules are complicated and could change over time. Any such changes could have a material impact on our overall tax rate.\nCanada has also introduced tax rules governing \u201cforeign affiliate dumping\u201d in the Canadian Tax Act that can have adverse tax consequences in respect of non-Canadian business activities and investments for Canadian corporations that are controlled by non-Canadian corporations. These rules would have a negative impact on us to the extent that we became controlled by a non-Canadian resident corporation.\nWe remain subject to changes in tax law (in various jurisdictions) and other factors that could impact our effective tax rate.\nThe tax laws of Canada, Australia and the U.S. could change in the future, and such changes could cause a material change in our effective corporate tax rate. As a result, our realized effective tax rate may be materially different from our current expectation. Our provision for income taxes will be based on certain estimates and assumptions made by management in consultation with our tax and other advisors. Our consolidated income tax rate will be affected by the amount of net income earned in Canada and our other operating jurisdictions, the availability of benefits under tax treaties, and the rates of taxes payable in respect of that income. We will enter into many transactions and arrangements in the ordinary course of business in respect of which the tax treatment is not entirely certain. We will therefore make estimates and judgments based on our knowledge and understanding of applicable tax laws and tax treaties, and the application of those tax laws and tax treaties to our business, in determining our consolidated tax provision. The final outcome of any audits by taxation authorities may differ from the estimates and assumptions we may use in determining our consolidated tax provisions and accruals. This could result in a material adverse effect on our consolidated income tax provision, financial condition and the net income for the period in which such determinations are made.\nThe U.S. Congress, government agencies in non-U.S. jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business, and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development have recently focused on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations. One example is found in the area of \u201cbase erosion and profit shifting\u201d, where profits are claimed to be earned for tax purposes in low-tax jurisdictions, or payments are made between affiliates from a jurisdiction with high tax rates to a jurisdiction with lower tax rates. As a result, the tax laws in the U.S. and other countries in which we and our affiliates do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis (or both), and any such changes could materially adversely affect us.\nThe Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) may disagree with our conclusions on tax treatment, and the CRA has not provided (and we have not requested), a ruling on the Canadian tax aspects of our redomestication.\nWe completed our redomestication from Delaware to British Columbia, Canada in 2015 (the Redomicile Transaction). We do not believe that the Redomicile Transaction resulted in any material Canadian federal income tax liability to us; however, the CRA did not provide (and we did not request) a ruling on the Canadian tax aspects of the Redomicile Transaction, and there can be no assurance that the CRA will agree with our interpretation of the tax aspects of the Redomicile Transaction or any related matters associated therewith. If the CRA were to disagree with our views about the tax implications of the Redomicile Transaction, it could take the position that material Canadian federal income tax liabilities or amounts on account thereof are payable by us as a result of the Redomicile Transaction, in which case, we expect that we would contest such assessment. To contest such assessment, we would be required to remit cash equal to half of the amount in dispute, or provide security acceptable to the CRA, to prevent the CRA from seeking enforcement actions pending the dispute of such assessment. If we were unsuccessful in disputing the assessment, the implications could be materially adverse to us. The CRA has not provided (and we have not requested) a ruling on the Canadian tax aspects of the Redomicile Transaction. There can be no assurance that the CRA will agree with our interpretation of the tax aspects of the Redomicile Transaction or any related matters associated therewith.\nFuture potential changes to U.S. tax laws could result in Civeo being treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nAlthough, as noted above, we believe that we are treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, changes to Section 7874 of the Internal Revenue Code or the U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder or official interpretations thereof, could adversely affect Civeo\u2019s status as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. For example, members of Congress from time to time have proposed changes to the Internal Revenue Code, and the U.S. Treasury has taken and may continue to take regulatory action, in connection with so-called inversion transactions. The timing and substance of any such change in law or regulatory action is uncertain. Any such change of law or regulatory action could adversely impact the treatment of Civeo as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and could adversely impact its tax position and financial position and results in a material manner. The precise scope and application of any legislative or regulatory proposals will not be clear until they are actually issued, and, accordingly, until such legislation or regulations are issued and fully understood, we cannot be certain as to their potential impact. Any such changes could apply retroactively to a date prior to the date of the Redomicile Transaction. If Civeo were to be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it could be subject to substantially greater U.S. federal income tax liability.", "PERMNO": 14619, "SIC": 7011, "TIC": "CVEO"}
