{"cik": "1522327", "company": "Entegra Financial Corp.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe Company and the Bank are each subject to a Memorandum of Understanding with their respective regulators, which require elevated capital ratios and other actions; failure to comply with the terms of the Regulatory Agreements may result in adverse consequences. On April 21, 2014, the Bank entered into the Bank MOU with the FDIC and Commissioner, which replaced the consent order entered into in 2012. In 2012, the Company entered into the Written Agreement with the FRB which was replaced with the Company MOU effective as of November 13, 2014.\nIn accordance with the terms of the Bank MOU, the Bank has agreed to, among other things, (i) continue to operate in accordance with its approved capital plan; (ii) submit a written business/strategic plan covering the overall operation of the Bank, (iii) perform stress tests and sensitivity analysis with respect to the construction, development, and other land loan concentrations of credit, (iv) reduce assets subject to adverse classification, (v) maintain a tier 1 leverage capital ratio of not less than 8.0%, and a total risk-based capital ratio of not less than 11.0%, (vi) establish and maintain a fully funded allowance for loan losses, and (vii) not accept, renew, or rollover any brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval. In addition, the Bank must obtain regulatory approval prior to paying any dividends to the Company. The Bank MOU will remain in effect until modified, terminated, lifted, suspended or set aside by the Bank Supervisory Authorities.\nUnder the Company MOU, the Company has agreed to, among other things, (i) not declare or pay any dividends, including payments on its trust preferred securities, without the prior approval of the FRB, (ii) not directly or indirectly take dividends or any other form of payments representing a reduction in capital from the Bank without prior written approval of the FRB, (iii) not, directly or indirectly, incur, increase, or guarantee any debt without the prior written approval of the FRB, (iv) preserve its cash assets and not dissipate those assets except for the benefit of the Bank, and (v) take appropriate steps to ensure that the Bank complies with any order, or other supervisory action entered into with the Bank\u2019s federal and state regulators. The Company MOU will remain in effect until modified, terminated, lifted, suspended or set aside by the FRB.\nThe Company and the Bank have taken and continue to take prompt and aggressive action to respond to the issues raised in the Regulatory Agreements. A material failure to comply with the terms of the Regulatory Agreements could subject the Company or the Bank to additional regulatory actions, and further regulation, which may have a material adverse effect on our future business, results of operations, financial condition and the value of our common stock.\nWe may not be able to utilize all of our deferred tax asset. As of December 31, 2014, we had a net deferred tax asset (before valuation allowance) of $21.9 million. We have established a valuation allowance for our net deferred tax asset to reduce its net carrying value to $2.1 million. Our ability to use our deferred tax asset, including the reversal or partial release of the valuation allowance, is dependent on our ability to generate future earnings within the operating loss carry-forward periods, which are generally 20 years. Some or all of our deferred tax asset could expire unused if we are unable to generate taxable income in the future sufficient to utilize the deferred tax asset, or we enter into transactions that limit our right to use it. If a material portion of our deferred tax asset expires unused, it could have a material adverse effect on our future business, results of operations, financial condition and the value of our common stock. Our ability to realize the deferred tax asset is periodically reviewed and the valuation allowance is adjusted accordingly.\nOur ability to realize our deferred tax asset and deduct certain future losses could be limited if we experience an ownership change as defined in the Code. Section 382 of the Code may limit the benefit of both net operating losses incurred to date and future \u201cbuilt-in-losses\u201d which may exist at the time of an \u201cownership change\u201d for federal income tax purposes. A Section 382 \u201cownership change\u201d occurs if a shareholder or a group of shareholders who are deemed to own at least 5% of our common stock increase their ownership in aggregate by more than 50% over their lowest ownership percentage within a testing period which is generally a rolling three-year period. If an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs, Section 382 would impose an annual limit on the amount of losses we can use to reduce our taxable income equal to the product of the total value of our outstanding equity (potentially subject to certain adjustments) immediately prior to the \u201cownership change\u201d and the federal long-term tax-exempt interest rate in effect for the month of the \u201cownership change.\u201d A number of special rules apply to calculating this limit.\nThe relevant calculations under Section 382 are technical and highly complex. Whether an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs in the future is largely outside of our control, and there can be no assurance that such a change will not occur. If an \u201cownership change\u201d were to occur, it is possible that the limitations imposed could cause a net increase in our federal income tax liability and cause federal income taxes to be paid earlier than if such limitations were not in effect. An ownership change could also eliminate a portion of the federal tax loss carryforward if the limitation is low and causes our net operating losses to expire unutilized. Any such \u201cownership change\u201d could have a material adverse effect on our future business, results of operations, financial condition and the value of our common stock.\nOur return on equity may be low until we are able to leverage the capital we received from the stock offering. Net income divided by average equity, known as \u201creturn on equity,\u201d is a ratio many investors use to compare the performance of a financial institution to its peers. We expect our return on equity to remain low until we are able to leverage the capital we received from the stock offering. Until we can increase our net interest income and noninterest income and fully-leverage the capital raised in the stock offering, we expect our return on equity to remain low, which may reduce the value of our shares of common stock.\nOur estimate for losses in our loan portfolio may be inadequate, which would cause our results of operations and financial condition to be adversely affected. We maintain an allowance for loan losses, which is a reserve established through a provision for possible loan losses charged to our expenses and represents management\u2019s best estimate of probable losses within our existing portfolio of loans. Our allowance for loan losses amounted to $11.1 million at December 31, 2014, as compared to $14.3 million as of December 31, 2013. The level of the allowance reflects management\u2019s estimates and judgments as to specific credit risks, evaluation of industry concentrations, loan loss experience, current loan portfolio quality, present economic, political and regulatory conditions and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio, which have been elevated in light of recent economic conditions. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires management to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. In addition, bank regulatory agencies review our allowance for loan losses during their periodic examinations, and may require an increase in the provision for possible loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs. Any such increases may have a material adverse effect on our future business, results of operations, financial condition and the value of our common stock.\nOur commercial real estate loans generally carry greater credit risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. At December 31, 2014, we had commercial real estate loans of $179.4 million, or 33.0% of total loans. These types of loans generally have higher risk-adjusted returns and shorter maturities than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Further, loans secured by commercial real estate properties are generally for larger amounts and involve a greater degree of risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Also, many of our borrowers have more than one of these types of loans outstanding. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one- to four-family residential mortgage loan. Payments on loans secured by these properties are often dependent on the income produced by the underlying properties which, in turn, depends on the successful operation and management of the properties. Accordingly, repayment of these loans can be negatively impacted by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the local economy. If loans that are collateralized by commercial real estate become troubled and the value of the collateral has been significantly impaired, then we may not be able to recover the full contractual amount of principal and interest that we anticipated at the time we originated the loan, which could cause us to increase our provision for loan losses which would in turn adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. While we seek to minimize these risks in a variety of ways, there can be no assurance that these measures will protect against credit-related losses.\nOur significant concentration of construction financing may expose us to a greater risk of loss and hurt our earnings and profitability. At December 31, 2014, we had other construction and land loans of $50.3 million, or 9.3% of total loans, and one-to four-family residential construction loans of $7.8 million, or 1.4% of total loans outstanding, to finance construction and land development. These loans are dependent on the successful completion of the projects they finance; however, in recent years many construction and development projects in our primary market area have not been completed in a timely manner, if at all.\nConstruction financing typically involves a higher degree of credit risk than financing on improved, owner-occupied real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan is largely dependent upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property\u2019s value at completion of construction and the bid price and estimated cost (including interest) of construction. If the estimate of construction costs proves to be inaccurate, we may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the project. If the estimate of the value proves to be inaccurate, we may be confronted, at or prior to the maturity of the loan, with a project whose value is insufficient to assure full repayment. When lending to builders, the cost of construction breakdown is provided by the builder, as well as supported by the appraisal. Although our underwriting criteria are designed to evaluate and minimize the risks of each construction loan, there can be no guarantee that these practices will safeguard against material delinquencies and losses to our operations.\nRepayment of our commercial business loans is primarily dependent on the cash flows of the borrower, which may be unpredictable, and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. We offer different types of commercial loans to a variety of small- to medium-sized businesses, and intend to increase our commercial business loan portfolio in the future. The types of commercial loans offered are business lines of credit and term equipment financing. Our commercial business loans are primarily underwritten based on the cash flow of the borrowers and secondarily on the underlying collateral, including real estate. The borrowers\u2019 cash flow may be unpredictable, and collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Some of our commercial business loans are collateralized by equipment, inventory, accounts receivable or other business assets, and the liquidation of collateral in the event of default is often an insufficient source of repayment because accounts receivable may be uncollectible and inventories may be obsolete or of limited use. As of December 31, 2014, our commercial business loans totaled $19.1 million, or 3.5% of our total loan portfolio.\nOur high level of home equity loans and lines of credit lending may expose us to increased credit risk. At December 31, 2014, we had home equity loans and lines of credit of $56.6 million, or 10.4% of total loans. Home equity loans and lines of credit typically involve a greater degree of risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Equity line lending allows customer to access an amount up to his, her or its line of credit limit for the term specified in their agreement. At the expiration of the term of an equity line, a customer may have the entire principal balance outstanding as opposed to a one- to four-family residential mortgage loan where the principal is disbursed entirely at closing and amortizes throughout the term of the loan. We cannot predict when and to what extent our customers will access their equity lines. While we seek to minimize this risk in a variety of ways, including attempting to employ conservative underwriting criteria, there can be no assurance that these measures will protect against credit-related losses.\nWe continue to hold and acquire other real estate, which has led to elevated operating expenses and vulnerability to additional declines in real property values. We foreclose on and take title to real estate serving as collateral for many of our loans as part of our business. Real estate owned by us and not used in the ordinary course of our operations is referred to as \u201creal estate owned\u201d or \u201cREO.\u201d At December 31, 2014, we had REO with an aggregate book value of $4.4 million, and real estate held for investment of $2.5 million, compared to $10.5 million and $2.5 million as of December 31, 2013. We obtain appraisals prior to taking title to real estate and periodically thereafter. However, in the event of a deterioration in real estate prices in our market areas, there can be no assurance that such valuations will reflect the amount which may be paid by a willing purchaser in an arms-length transaction at the time of the final sale. Moreover, we cannot assure investors that the losses associated with REO will not exceed the estimated amounts, which would adversely affect future results of our operations.\nThe calculation for the adequacy of write-downs of our REO is based on several factors, including the appraised value of the real property, economic conditions in the property\u2019s sub-market, comparable sales, current buyer demand, availability of financing, entitlement and development obligations and costs and historic loss experience. All of these factors have caused significant write-downs in recent years and can change without notice based on market and economic conditions. Elevated levels of non-performing assets indicate that REO balances will continue to be significant for the foreseeable future. Higher REO balances have led to greater expenses as we incur costs to manage and dispose of the properties. We expect that our earnings will continue to be negatively affected by various expenses associated with REO, including personnel costs, insurance and taxes, completion and repair costs, valuation adjustments and other expenses associated with property ownership, as well as by the funding costs associated with assets that are tied up in REO. Moreover, our ability to sell REO is affected by public perception that banks are inclined to accept large discounts from market value in order to quickly liquidate properties. Any material decrease in market prices may lead to further REO write-downs, with a corresponding expense in our statement of operations. Further write-downs on REO or an inability to sell REO properties could have a material adverse effect on our future business, results of operations, financial condition and the value of our common stock. Furthermore, the management and resolution of non-performing assets, which include REO, increases our costs and requires significant commitments of time from our management and directors, which can be detrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities. The expenses associated with REO and any further property write-downs could have a material adverse effect on our future business, results of operations, financial condition and the value of our common stock.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate, and events that negatively impact the real estate market could hurt our business. A significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate. As of December 31, 2014, 95.9% of our loans had real estate as a primary or secondary component of collateral. The real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended. A weakening of the real estate market in our market areas could result in an increase in the number of borrowers who default on their loans and a reduction in the value of the collateral securing their loans, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our profitability and asset quality. If we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values, our results of operations, financial condition and the value of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nConcentration of collateral in our primary market area may increase the risk of increased non-performing assets. Our primary market area consists of the western North Carolina counties of Cherokee, Henderson, Jackson, Macon, Polk and Transylvania. At December 31, 2014, approximately $435.3 million, or 80.5%, of our loans were secured by real estate located within our primary area. A decline in real estate values in our primary market area would lower the value of the collateral securing loans on properties in this area, and may increase our level of non-performing assets.\nIncome from secondary mortgage market operations is volatile, and we may incur losses with respect to our secondary mortgage market operations that could negatively affect our earnings. A key component of our existing business is to sell in the secondary market longer term, conforming fixed-rate residential mortgage loans that we originate, earning non-interest income in the form of gains on sale. When interest rates rise, the demand for mortgage loans tends to fall and may reduce the number of loans we can originate for sale. Weak or deteriorating economic conditions also tend to reduce loan demand. Although we originate, and intend to continue originating, loans on a \u201cbest efforts\u201d basis, and we sell, and intend to continue selling, most loans in the secondary market with limited or no recourse, we are required, and will continue to be required, to give customary representations and warranties to the buyers relating to compliance with applicable law. If we breach those representations and warranties, the buyers will be able to require us to repurchase the loans and we may incur a loss on the repurchase that could negatively affect our earnings.\nFuture changes in interest rates could reduce our profits. Our ability to make a profit largely depends on our net interest income, which could be negatively affected by changes in interest rates. Net interest income is the difference between:\n\u2022\nthe interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities; and\n\u2022\nthe interest expense we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings.\nTiming differences that can result from our interest-earning assets not repricing at the same time as our interest-bearing liabilities can negatively impact our net interest income. In addition, the amount of change in interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities can also vary and present a risk to the amount of net interest margin earned. We generally employ market indexes when making portfolio loans in order to reduce the interest rate risk in our loan portfolio. Those indexes may not move in tandem with changes in rates of our funding sources, depending on market demand. As part of our achieving a balanced earning asset portfolio and earning acceptable yields, we also invest in longer term fixed rate municipal securities and in securities which have issuer callable features. These securities could reduce our net interest income or lengthen the average life during periods of high interest rate volatility. We also employ forecasting models to measure and manage the risk within stated policy guidelines. Notwithstanding these tools and practices, we are not assured that we can reprice our assets commensurately to interest rate changes in our funding sources, particularly during periods of high interest rate volatility. The difference in the timing of repricing our assets and liabilities may result in a decline in our earnings.\nOur total loan balance may decline, which may negatively impact our net interest income. At December 31, 2014, our non-owner occupied commercial real estate and other construction and real estate loans totaled $122.0 million, or 22.4%, of our total loan portfolio. Since mid-2007, we have sought to reduce our concentration in these higher risk loan categories. In the future, we intend to increase our focus on small- to medium-sized business customers. As we seek to change the mix of our loan portfolio and reduce our higher risk loan concentrations, it is possible that our total loan balance may decline, which in turn may negatively impact interest income.\nStrong competition within our market areas may limit our growth and profitability. Competition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. In our market areas, we compete with credit unions, commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere. Some of our competitors have greater name recognition and market presence that benefit them in attracting business, and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide. In addition, larger competitors may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively than we do, which could affect our ability to grow and remain profitable on a long-term basis. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market areas. If we must raise interest rates paid on deposits or lower interest rates charged on our loans, our net interest margin and profitability could be adversely affected.\nThe financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of continuing technological changes and increasing consolidation. Technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. Many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. Additionally, due to their size, many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than we can.\nOur stock-based benefit plan will increase our costs, which will reduce our income. Our current intention is to adopt one or more stock-based benefit plans, that would award participants shares of our common stock (at no cost to them), options to purchase shares of our common stock and/or other equity-based compensation. The number of shares of restricted stock or stock options reserved for issuance under any initial stock-based benefit plan will not exceed 3% and 7%, respectively, of our total outstanding shares, if the plan is adopted within 12 months after the completion of the conversion and the offering. We may grant shares of common stock and stock options in excess of these amounts provided the stock-based benefit plans are adopted more than one year following the conversion and the offering. Assuming a $14.39 per share option exercise price and an estimated grant-date fair value of the options utilizing a Black-Scholes option pricing analysis of $4.47 per option granted, with the value amortized over a five-year vesting period, the corresponding annual pre-tax expense associated with the stock options would be $0.4 million at the adjusted maximum of the offering range. In addition, assuming that all shares of restricted stock are awarded at a price of $14.39 per share, and that the awards vest over a five-year period, the corresponding annual pre-tax expense associated with restricted stock awarded under a stock-based benefit plan would be $0.6 million at the adjusted maximum. However, if we grant shares of common stock or options in excess of these amounts, such grants would increase our costs further. The shares of restricted stock granted under a stock-based benefit plan will be expensed by us over their vesting period at the fair market value of the shares on the date they are awarded.\nThe implementation of stock-based benefit plans may dilute your ownership interest. Our current intention is to adopt one or more stock-based benefit plans, that would award participants shares of our common stock (at no cost to them), options to purchase shares of our common stock and/or other equity-based compensation. These stock-based benefit plans will be funded through either open market purchases of shares of common stock and/or from the issuance of authorized but unissued shares of common stock. Our ability to repurchase shares of common stock to fund these plans will be subject to many factors, including, but not limited to, applicable regulatory restrictions on stock repurchases, the availability of stock in the market, the trading price of the stock, our capital levels, alternative uses for our capital and our financial performance. Although our current intention is to fund these plans with stock repurchases, we may not be able to conduct such repurchases. If we do not repurchase shares of common stock to fund these plans, then shareholders would experience a reduction in their ownership interest, which would total 9.1% in the event newly issued shares are used to fund stock options or awards of shares of common stock under these plans in an amount equal to 7% and 3%, respectively, of the shares issued in the stock offering. We may grant shares of common stock and stock options in excess of these amounts provided the stock-based benefit plan is adopted more than one year following the conversion and the offering.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation and oversight, and, depending upon the findings and determinations of our regulatory authorities, we may be required to make adjustments to our business, operations or financial position and could become subject to formal or informal regulatory action. We are subject to extensive regulation and supervision, including examination by federal and state banking regulators. Federal and state regulators have the ability to impose substantial sanctions, restrictions and requirements on us if they determine, upon conclusion of their examination or otherwise, violations of laws with which we must comply or weaknesses or failures with respect to general standards of safety and soundness, including, for example, in respect of any financial concerns that the regulators may identify and desire for us to address. Such enforcement may be formal or informal and can include directors\u2019 resolutions, memoranda of understanding, consent orders, civil money penalties and termination of deposit insurance and bank closure. Enforcement actions may be taken regardless of the capital levels of the institutions, and regardless of prior examination findings. In particular, institutions that are not sufficiently capitalized in accordance with regulatory standards may also face capital directives or prompt corrective actions. Enforcement actions may require certain corrective steps (including staff additions or changes), impose limits on activities (such as lending, deposit taking, acquisitions, paying dividends or branching), prescribe lending parameters (such as loan types, volumes and terms) and require additional capital to be raised, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. The imposition of regulatory sanctions, including monetary penalties, may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations and/or damage our reputation. In addition, compliance with any such action could distract management\u2019s attention from our operations, cause us to incur significant expenses, restrict us from engaging in potentially profitable activities and limit our ability to raise capital.\nFinancial reform legislation enacted by Congress and resulting regulations have increased, and are expected to continue to increase our costs of operations. In 2010, Congress enacted the Dodd-Frank Act. This law has significantly changed the structure of the bank regulatory system and affects the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations, and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. The federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations. Although some of these regulations have been promulgated, many additional regulations are expected to be issued in 2015 and thereafter. Consequently, many of the details and much of the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act may not be known for many months or years.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the \u201cBureau\u201d) with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The Bureau has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit \u201cunfair, deceptive or abusive\u201d acts and practices. It also has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. Banks and savings institutions with $10 billion or less in assets will be examined by their applicable bank regulators. The Dodd-Frank Act also weakens the federal preemption rules that have been applicable for national banks and federal savings associations, and gives state attorneys general the ability to enforce federal consumer protection laws.\nIt is difficult to quantify what specific impact the Dodd-Frank Act and related regulations have had on the Bank to date and what impact yet to be written regulations will have on us in the future. However, it is expected that at a minimum these measures will increase our costs of doing business and increase our costs related to regulatory compliance, and may have a significant adverse effect on our lending activities, financial performance and operating flexibility.\nWe face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations. The federal Bank Secrecy Act, the USA Patriot Act and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain effective anti-money laundering programs and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, established by the U.S. Treasury to administer the Bank Secrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration and Internal Revenue Service. There is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d). Federal and state bank regulators also focus on compliance with Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering regulations. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient or the policies, procedures and systems of any financial institutions that we may acquire in the future are deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including any acquisition plans, which would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us.\nWe are subject to more stringent capital requirements, which may adversely impact our return on equity, require us to raise additional capital, or constrain us from paying dividends or repurchasing shares. In July 2013, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC approved new rules that substantially amended the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to the Bank. The final rule implements the \u201cBasel III\u201d regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act.\nThe final rule includes new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which will be effective for the Bank and the Company on January 1, 2015, and revises the definition of what constitutes \u201ccapital\u201d for purposes of calculating those ratios. The new minimum capital requirements are: (i) a new common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); (iii) a total capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from current rules); and (iv) a tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. These rules also establish a \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d of 2.5%, and will result in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (ii) a tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The new capital conservation buffer requirement will be phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such actions.\nIn addition to the higher required capital ratios and the new deductions and adjustments, the final rules increase the risk weights for certain assets, meaning that we will have to hold more capital against these assets. For example, commercial real estate loans that do not meet certain new underwriting requirements must be risk-weighted at 150%, rather than the current 100%. There are also new risk weights for unsettled transactions and derivatives.\nThe application of more stringent capital requirements for the Bank could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, require the raising of additional capital, and result in regulatory actions constraining us from paying dividends or repurchasing shares if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements.\nWe are restricted from paying dividends or repurchasing our common stock. Under the Company MOU, we may not declare or pay any dividends or repurchase our common stock, without the prior approval of the FRB. Under current federal regulations, subject to certain exceptions, we may not repurchase shares of our common stock during the first year following the completion of our conversion. Further, Federal Reserve policy generally limits our ability to repurchase stock.\nWe depend on our management team to implement our business strategy and execute successful operations and we could be harmed by the loss of their services. We are dependent upon the services of our management team. Our strategy and operations are directed by the executive management team. Any loss of the services of our President and Chief Executive Officer or other members of our management team could impact our ability to implement our business strategy, and have a material adverse effect on our future business, results of operations, financial condition and the value of our common stock.\nThe fair value of our investments could decline. As of December 31, 2014, approximately 88.2% of our investment portfolio was designated as available-for-sale. Unrealized gains and losses in the estimated value of the available-for-sale portfolio must be \u201cmarked to market\u201d and reflected as a separate item in shareholders\u2019 equity (net of tax) as accumulated other comprehensive income. Shareholders\u2019 equity will continue to reflect the unrealized gains and losses (net of tax) of these investments. The fair value of our investment portfolio may decline, causing a corresponding decline in shareholders\u2019 equity.\nContinued or further declines in the value of certain investment securities could require write-downs, which would reduce our earnings. Our securities portfolio includes securities that have declined in value due to negative perceptions about the health of the municipal securities sector. A prolonged decline in the value of these or other securities could result in an other-than-temporary impairment write-down which would reduce our earnings.\nLiquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Liquidity is essential to our business. Our ability to implement our business strategy will depend on our ability to obtain funding for loan originations, working capital, possible acquisitions and other general corporate purposes. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, securities sold under repurchase agreements, the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. From time to time we rely on deposits obtained through intermediaries, FHLB advances, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other wholesale funding sources to obtain the funds necessary to manage our balance sheet.\nOur access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or on terms which are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general, including a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which our loans are concentrated or adverse regulatory action against us. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry. To the extent we are not successful in obtaining such funding, we will be unable to implement our strategy as planned which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges in accounting standards could affect reported earnings. The accounting standard setters, including the PCAOB, the FASB, the SEC and other regulatory bodies, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply new or revised guidance retroactively.\nThe FASB is moving forward with its proposal to change the manner in which the allowance for credit losses is established and evaluated from the concept of incurred losses to that of expected losses. The effect of this change in accounting standard on our financial position and results of operations has not been quantified; however, if it results in a material increase in our allowance and future provisions for credit losses, this could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with our lending activities. A significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations of enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. Although we have policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on real property, these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our future business, results of operations, financial condition and the value of our common stock.\nA failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors and other service providers or other third parties, including as a result of cyber attacks, could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs, and cause losses. We rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Information security risks for financial institutions such as ours have generally increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies; the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions; and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, and other external parties. As customer, public, and regulatory expectations regarding operational and information security have increased, our operating systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures, disruptions, and breakdowns. Our business, financial, accounting, and data processing systems, or other operating systems and facilities may stop operating properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control. For example, there could be electrical or telecommunication outages; natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes, and hurricanes; disease pandemics; events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts; and as described below, cyber attacks.\nAs noted above, our business relies on our digital technologies, computer and email systems, software and networks to conduct its operations. Although we have information security procedures and controls in place, our technologies, systems, networks, and our customers\u2019 devices may become the target of cyber attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss, or destruction of our or our customers\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 confidential information. Third parties with whom we do business or that facilitate our business activities, including financial intermediaries, or vendors that provide service or security solutions for our operations, and other unaffiliated third parties could also be sources of operational and information security risk to us, including from breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints.\nWhile we have disaster recovery and other policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption or security breach of our information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of the evolving nature of these threats. As a result, cyber security and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes, and practices designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data, and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a focus for us. As threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate information security vulnerabilities. Disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and clients, or cyber attacks or security breaches of the networks, systems or devices that our customers use to access our products and services could result in client attrition, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reputation damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, and/or additional compliance costs, any of which could have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe will face risks with respect to expansion through future offices, acquisitions, or mergers. From time to time, we may seek to acquire other financial institutions or parts of those institutions. We may also expand into new markets or lines of business or offer new products or services. These activities would involve a number of risks, including:\n\u00b7 the potential inaccuracy of the estimates and judgments used to evaluate credit, operations, management, and market risks with respect to a target institution;\n\u00b7 the time and costs of evaluating new markets, hiring or retaining experienced local management, and opening new offices and the time lags between these activities and the generation of sufficient assets and deposits to support the costs of the expansion;\n\u00b7 the incurrence and possible impairment of goodwill associated with an acquisition and possible adverse effects on our results of operations; and\n\u00b7 the risk of loss of key employees and customers.\nNew or acquired banking office facilities and other facilities may not be profitable. We may not be able to identify profitable locations for new banking offices. The costs to start up new banking offices or to acquire existing branches, and the additional costs to operate these facilities, may increase our non-interest expense and decrease our earnings in the short term. If branches of other banks become available for sale, we may acquire those offices. It may be difficult to adequately and profitably manage our growth through the establishment or purchase of additional banking offices and we can provide no assurance that any such banking offices will successfully attract enough deposits to offset the expenses of their operation. In addition, any new or acquired banking offices will be subject to regulatory approval, and there can be no assurance that we will succeed in securing such approval.\nWe are party to various lawsuits incidental to our business. Litigation is subject to many uncertainties such that the expenses and ultimate exposure with respect to many of these matters cannot be ascertained. From time to time, customers and others make claims and take legal action pertaining to our performance of fiduciary responsibilities. Whether claims and legal actions are legitimate or unfounded, if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in our favor, they may result in significant financial liability and/or adversely affect the market perception of us and our products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services. Any financial liability or reputation damage could have a material adverse effect on our business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur stock price may be volatile, which could result in losses to our shareholders and litigation against us. Our stock price has been volatile in the past and several factors could cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the future. These factors include but are not limited to: actual or anticipated variations in earnings, changes in analysts\u2019 recommendations or projections, our announcement of developments related to our businesses, operations and stock performance of other companies deemed to be peers, new technology used or services offered by traditional and non-traditional competitors, news reports of trends, irrational exuberance on the part of investors, new federal banking regulations, and other issues related to the financial services industry. Our stock price may fluctuate significantly in the future, and these fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance. General market declines or market volatility in the future, especially in the financial institutions sector, could adversely affect the price of our common stock, and the current market price may not be indicative of future market prices. Stock price volatility may make it more difficult for you to resell your common stock when you want and at prices you find attractive. Moreover, in the past, securities class action lawsuits have been instituted against some companies following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We could in the future be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources from our normal business.\nThe trading volume in our common stock is lower than that of other larger companies; future sales of our stock by our shareholders or the perception that those sales could occur may cause our stock price to decline. Although our common stock is listed for trading on the NASDAQ Global Market, the trading volume in our common stock is lower than that of other larger financial services companies. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control. Given the relatively low trading volume of our common stock, significant sales of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that those sales may occur, could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline or to be lower than it otherwise might be in the absence of those sales or perceptions.\nNegative public opinion surrounding our Company and the financial institutions industry generally could damage our reputation and adversely impact our earnings. Reputation risk, or the risk to our business, earnings and capital from negative public opinion surrounding our company and the financial institutions industry generally, is inherent in our business. Negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, corporate governance and acquisitions, and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to keep and attract clients and employees and can expose us to litigation and regulatory action. Although we take steps to minimize reputation risk in dealing with our clients and communities, this risk will always be present given the nature of our business.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, and other external events could significantly impact our business. Severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business. Such events could affect the stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue, and/or cause us to incur additional expenses. Although management has established disaster recovery plans and procedures, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our future business, results of operations, financial condition and the value of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 15006, "SIC": 6036, "TIC": "ENFC"}
