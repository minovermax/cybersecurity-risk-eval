{"cik": "21665", "company": "COLGATE PALMOLIVE CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-02-15", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the risks described elsewhere in this report, set forth below is a summary of the material risks to an investment in our securities. These risks are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted, which might cause the value of our securities to decline.\nWe face risks associated with significant international operations, including exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.\nWe operate on a global basis serving consumers in more than 200 countries and territories with approximately 75% of our Net sales originating in markets outside the U.S. While geographic diversity helps to reduce our exposure to risks in any one country or part of the world, it also means that we are subject to the full range of risks associated with significant international operations, including, but not limited to:\n\u25aa\nchanges in exchange rates for foreign currencies, which may reduce the U.S. dollar value of revenues, profits and cash flows from non-U.S. markets or increase our supply costs, as measured in U.S. dollars, in those markets;\n\u25aa\nexchange controls and other limits on our ability to import or export raw materials or finished product or to repatriate earnings from overseas;\n\u25aa\npolitical or economic instability, social or labor unrest or changing macroeconomic conditions in our markets, including as a result of volatile commodity prices, including the price of oil;\n\u25aa\nlack of well-established or reliable legal systems in certain countries where we operate;\n\u25aa\nforeign ownership restrictions and the potential for nationalization or expropriation of property or other resources; and\n\u25aa\nother foreign or domestic legal and regulatory requirements, including those resulting in potentially adverse tax consequences or the imposition of onerous trade restrictions and/or tariffs, price controls, labor laws, travel or immigration restrictions, profit controls or other government controls.\nThese risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis and may adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nIn an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements, we engage in a combination of selling price increases, where permitted, sourcing strategies, cost-containment measures and selective hedging of foreign currency transactions. However, the impact of these measures may not fully offset any negative impact of foreign currency rate movements on our business and results of operations.\nSignificant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business.\nWe face vigorous competition worldwide, including from strong local competitors and from other large, multinational companies, some of which may have greater resources than we do. We face this competition in several aspects of our business, including, but not limited to, the pricing of products, promotional activities, new product introductions and expansion into new geographies. Some of our competitors may spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities than we do, introduce competing products more quickly and/or respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions. Such competition also extends to administrative and legal challenges of product claims and advertising. Our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brands and on our ability to enforce and defend our intellectual property, including patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret and trade dress rights against infringement and legal challenges by competitors.\nWe may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such initiatives or challenges by competitors or to successfully respond to them, which could harm our business. In addition, the cost of responding to such initiatives and challenges, including management time, out-of-pocket expenses and price reductions, may affect our performance in the relevant period. A failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to legal and regulatory risks in the U.S. and abroad.\nOur business is subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements in the U.S. and abroad. Such legal and regulatory requirements apply to most aspects of our products, including their development, ingredients, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, transportation, distribution, export, import, advertising and sale. U.S. federal authorities, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the \u201cFDA\u201d), the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Environmental Protection Agency, regulate different aspects of our business, along with parallel authorities at the state and local levels and comparable authorities overseas. Also, our selling practices are regulated by competition law authorities in the U.S. and abroad.\nNew or more stringent legal or regulatory requirements, or more restrictive interpretations of existing requirements, could adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For example, from time to time, various regulatory authorities in Europe, the U.S. and other countries review the use of various ingredients in consumer products. Triclosan, an ingredient used by us in Colgate Total toothpaste, is an example of an ingredient that has undergone reviews by various regulatory authorities worldwide, both by itself and in the context of its use in specific products or types of products. In the U.S., Colgate Total toothpaste is subject to the FDA\u2019s rigorous New Drug Application (\u201cNDA\u201d) process for safety and efficacy. Effective September 2017, the FDA restricted the use of 19 active ingredients, including triclosan and triclocarban, in antibacterial consumer soaps in the U.S. Our consumer soaps do not contain triclosan or triclocarbon. Some states and municipalities in the U.S. have proposed, and Minnesota has passed, legislation banning the sale of certain consumer products containing triclosan. The Minnesota legislation does not cover Colgate Total toothpaste. In November 2016, the Canadian government finalized its review of the potential human and environmental risks of triclosan, concluding that triclosan does not enter the environment in quantities or conditions that pose a danger in Canada to human life or health, and that triclosan is neither bioaccumulative nor persistent, but that triclosan could be entering the environment at levels that could potentially cause harm to some aquatic organisms. The Canadian government is now working with stakeholders to ensure triclosan remains under a level it has determined to be safe, and we will participate in this process. Triclosan is also currently being evaluated under the European Union\u2019s Regulation for the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals, which evaluation process is expected to take several years to complete.\nA decision by a regulatory or governmental authority that triclosan, or any other of our ingredients, should not be used in certain consumer products or should otherwise be newly regulated, could adversely impact our business, as could negative reactions by our consumers, trade customers or non-governmental organizations to our use of such ingredients. Additionally, an inability to develop new or reformulated products containing alternative ingredients or to obtain regulatory approval of such products on a timely basis could likewise adversely affect our business.\nBecause of our extensive international operations, we could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d) and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. The FCPA and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees, joint-venture partners or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and adversely affect our reputation and our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWhile it is our policy and practice to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business, a finding that we are in violation of, or out of compliance with, applicable laws or regulations could subject us to civil remedies, including fines, damages, injunctions or product recalls, or criminal sanctions, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Even if a claim is unsuccessful, is without merit or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products, processes or business practices could adversely affect our reputation and brand image. For information regarding our legal and regulatory matters, see Item 3 \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d and Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIncreasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets, changes in the policies of our retail trade customers, the emergence of new sales channels and the growing presence of e-commerce retailers may adversely affect our business.\nOur products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which has experienced increased trade concentration and the growing presence of large-format retailers and discounters. With the growing trend toward retail trade consolidation, we are increasingly dependent on key retailers, and some of these retailers, including large-format retailers, may have greater bargaining strength than we do. They may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts, allowances or slotting fees, which could lead to reduced sales or profitability. The loss of a key customer or a significant reduction in sales to a key customer could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For additional information regarding our customers, see \u201cDistribution; Raw Materials; Competition; Trademarks and Patents\u201d in Item 1 \u201cBusiness.\u201d\nWe also have been and may continue to be negatively affected by changes in the policies or practices of our retail trade customers, such as inventory de-stocking, limitations on access to shelf space, delisting of our products, environmental or sustainability initiatives and other conditions. For example, a determination by a key retailer that any of our ingredients should not be used in certain consumer products could adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, private label products sold by retail trade chains, which are typically sold at lower prices than branded products, are a source of competition for certain of our product lines. The emergence of new sales channels for our products may affect, and the growing presence of e-commerce retailers have affected and may continue to affect, consumer preferences and market dynamics and could also adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nThe growth of our business depends on the successful identification, development and launch of innovative new products.\nOur growth depends on the continued success of existing products, as well as the successful launch of innovative new products and line extensions. Our ability to launch new products and line extensions and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can successfully:\n\u25aa\nidentify, develop and fund technological innovations;\n\u25aa\nobtain and maintain necessary intellectual property protection and avoid infringing intellectual property rights of others;\n\u25aa\nobtain approvals and registrations of regulated products, including from the FDA and other regulatory bodies in the U.S. and abroad; and\n\u25aa\nanticipate and respond to consumer needs and preferences.\nThe identification, development and introduction of innovative new products and line extensions involve considerable costs, and any new product or line extension may not generate sufficient customer and consumer interest and sales to become a profitable product or to cover the costs of its development and promotion. Our ability to achieve a successful launch of a new product or line extension could also be adversely affected by preemptive actions taken by competitors in response to the launch, such as increased promotional activities and advertising.\nThe failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business and any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in us not being the first to market, which could compromise our competitive position and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nIf, in the course of identifying or developing new products, we are found to have infringed the trademark, trade secret, copyright, patent or other intellectual property rights of others, directly or indirectly, through the use of third-party ideas or technologies, such a finding could adversely affect our ability to develop innovative new products and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Even if we are not found to infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, claims of infringement could adversely affect us, including by increasing costs and by delaying the launch of new products.\nWe may not realize the benefits that we expect from our Global Growth and Efficiency Program.\nOur restructuring program, which we refer to as the \u201cGlobal Growth and Efficiency Program,\u201d is ongoing. The Global Growth and Efficiency Program\u2019s initiatives are expected to help us ensure sustained solid worldwide growth in unit volume, organic sales, operating profit and earnings per share and enhance our global leadership positions in our core businesses. While implementation of the Global Growth and Efficiency Program is well underway and many of the initiatives under the program have been successfully implemented or are nearing completion, the successful implementation of the remainder of the program presents significant organizational challenges and, in some cases, may require successful negotiations with third parties. As a result, we may not be able to realize all of the remaining anticipated benefits from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program. Events and circumstances, such as financial or strategic difficulties, delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing all of the remaining anticipated benefits or our not realizing such benefits on our expected timetable. In addition, changes in foreign exchange rates or in tax, labor or immigration laws may result in our not achieving the remaining anticipated cost savings as measured in U.S. dollars. If we are unable to realize the remaining anticipated savings of the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, our ability to fund other initiatives and enhance profitability may be adversely affected. Any failure to implement the Global Growth and Efficiency Program in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For additional information regarding the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, refer to Part II, Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Significant Items Impacting Comparability\u201d and \u201c- Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges.\u201d\nThere is no guarantee that our ongoing efforts to reduce costs will be successful.\nOne way that we generate funds needed to support the growth of our business is through our continuous, Company-wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization, which we refer to as our funding-the-growth initiatives. These initiatives are designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials, indirect expenses, distribution and logistics, and advertising and promotional materials, among other things. The achievement of our funding-the-growth goals depends on our ability to successfully identify and realize additional savings opportunities. Events and circumstances, such as financial or strategic difficulties, delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing any or all of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing the anticipated benefits on our expected timetable. If we are unable to realize the anticipated savings of our funding-the-growth initiatives, our ability to fund other initiatives and achieve our profitability goals may be adversely affected. Any failure to implement our funding-the-growth initiatives in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For additional information regarding our funding-the-growth initiatives, refer to Part II, Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Executive Overview.\u201d\nDamage to our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business.\nMaintaining our strong reputation with consumers and our trade partners globally is critical to selling our branded products. Accordingly, we devote significant time and resources to programs designed to protect and preserve our reputation, such as our Ethics and Compliance, Sustainability, Brand Protection and Product Safety, Regulatory and Quality initiatives. Adverse publicity about us, our brands, our supply chain or our ingredients regarding health concerns, legal or regulatory proceedings, environmental impacts (including packaging, energy and water use and waste management) or other sustainability or policy issues, whether or not deserved, could jeopardize our reputation. In addition, widespread use of digital and social media by consumers has greatly increased the accessibility of information and the speed of its dissemination. Negative publicity, posts or comments on social media about us, our brands or our products, whether true or untrue, could damage our brands and our reputation. The success of our brands could also suffer if our marketing initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand\u2019s image or its ability to attract consumers.\nAdditionally, due to the scale and scope of our business, we must rely on relationships with third parties, including our suppliers, distributors, contractors, joint venture partners and other external business partners, for certain functions. While we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships, they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, governance and compliance, thereby potentially increasing our reputational and legal risk.\nIn addition, third parties sell counterfeit versions of our products, which are inferior or may pose safety risks. As a result, consumers of our brands could confuse our products with these counterfeit products, which could cause them to refrain from purchasing our brands in the future and in turn could impair our brand equity and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nDamage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for these or any other reasons could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, as well as require resources to rebuild our reputation.\nVolatility in material and other costs could adversely impact our profitability.\nRaw and packaging material commodities such as resins, pulp, essential oils, tropical oils, tallow, poultry, corn and soybeans are subject to wide price variations. Increases in the costs and availability of these commodities and the costs of energy, transportation and other necessary services have affected and may continue to adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along such higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies, such as in manufacturing and distribution. As a result, fluctuations in such prices and costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See \u201cDisruption in our global supply chain or key office facilities could adversely impact our business\u201d below for additional information.\nLegal claims and proceedings could adversely impact our business.\nAs a global company serving consumers in more than 200 countries and territories, we may be subject to a wide variety of legal claims and proceedings, including disputes relating to intellectual property, contracts, product liability, marketing, advertising, foreign exchange controls, antitrust and trade regulation, as well as labor and employment, pension, privacy, environmental and tax matters and consumer class actions. Regardless of their merit, these claims can require significant time and expense to investigate and defend. Since litigation is inherently uncertain, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such claims or proceedings, or that our assessment of the materiality of these matters, including any reserves taken in connection therewith, will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such matters. In addition, if one of our products, or a raw material contained in our products, is perceived or found to be defective or unsafe, we may need to recall some of our products. Whether or not a legal claim or proceeding is successful, or a recall is required, such assertions could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the negative publicity surrounding them could harm our reputation and brand image. See Item 3 \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d and Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on certain of our legal claims and proceedings.\nDisruption in our global supply chain or key office facilities could adversely impact our business.\nWe are engaged in manufacturing and sourcing of products and materials on a global scale. Our operations and those of our suppliers could be disrupted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u25aa\nenvironmental events;\n\u25aa\nstrikes and other labor disputes;\n\u25aa\ndisruptions in logistics;\n\u25aa\nloss or impairment of key manufacturing sites;\n\u25aa\nloss of key suppliers;\n\u25aa\nsupplier capacity constraints;\n\u25aa\nraw material and product quality or safety issues;\n\u25aa\nindustrial accidents or other occupational health and safety issues;\n\u25aa\nthe impact on our suppliers of tighter credit or capital markets; and\n\u25aa\nnatural disasters, including climatic events and earthquakes, acts of war or terrorism and other external factors over which we have no control.\nIn addition, we purchase certain key raw and packaging materials from single-source suppliers or a limited number of suppliers and new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry, governmental and Colgate standards, which can require additional investment and take a significant period of time.\nWhile we believe that the supplies of raw materials needed to manufacture our products are adequate and have business continuity and contingency plans in place for key manufacturing sites and the supply of raw and packaging materials, significant disruption of manufacturing or sourcing of products or materials for any reason, including any of the above reasons, could interrupt product supply and, if not remedied, have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nIn addition, as a result of our clustering of single-country subsidiaries into regional commercial hubs and our implementation of a global shared service organizational model, certain of our functions, such as marketing, finance and accounting, customer service and logistics, and human resources, have become more concentrated in key office facilities. A significant disruption to any of our key office facilities for any reason, including natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nA cyber-security incident, data breach or a failure of a key information technology system could adversely impact our business or reputation.\nWe rely extensively on information technology systems (\u201cIT Systems\u201d), including some which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third parties and their vendors, in order to conduct our business. Our uses of these systems include, but are not limited to:\n\u25aa\ncommunicating within our company and with other parties, including our customers and consumers;\n\u25aa\nordering and managing materials from suppliers;\n\u25aa\nconverting materials to finished products;\n\u25aa\nreceiving and processing orders from and shipping products to our customers;\n\u25aa\nmarketing products to consumers;\n\u25aa\ncollecting and storing customer, consumer, employee, investor and other stakeholder information and personal data;\n\u25aa\nprocessing transactions, including but not limited to employee payroll, employee and retiree benefits and payments to customers and vendors;\n\u25aa\nhosting, processing and sharing confidential and proprietary research, business plans and financial information;\n\u25aa\ncomplying with legal, regulatory and tax requirements;\n\u25aa\nproviding data security; and\n\u25aa\nhandling other processes involved in managing our business.\nAlthough we have a broad array of information security measures in place, our IT Systems, including those of third-party service providers with whom we have contracted, have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access attempts, phishing and other cyber-attacks. Cyber-attacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently, are constantly evolving in nature, are becoming more sophisticated and are being made by groups and individuals with a wide range of expertise and motives. Such cyber-attacks and cyber incidents can take many forms, including cyber extortion, social engineering, password theft or introduction of viruses or malware, such as ransomware through phishing emails. We cannot guarantee that our security efforts will prevent breaches or breakdowns of our, or our third-party service providers\u2019, IT Systems since the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time. In addition, although we have policies and procedures in place to ensure that all personal information collected by us or our third-party service providers is securely maintained, data breaches due to human error or intentional or unintentional conduct have occurred and likely will continue to occur. Although we have seen no material impact on our business operations from the cyber-security attacks and data breaches we have experienced to date, if we suffer a loss or disclosure of confidential business or stakeholder information as a result of a breach of our IT Systems, including those of third-party service providers with whom we have contracted, we may suffer reputational, competitive and/or business harm, incur significant costs and be subject to government investigations, litigation, fines and/or damages, which may adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nFurthermore, while we have disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place, if our IT Systems are damaged, breached or cease to function properly for any reason, including the poor performance of, failure of or cyber-attack on third-party service providers, catastrophic events, power outages, cyber-security breaches, network outages, failed upgrades or other similar events and, if the disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve such issues on a timely basis, we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage or conduct business as well as reputational harm, and may be subject to governmental investigations and litigation, any of which may adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nUncertain global economic conditions and disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect our business.\nUncertain global economic conditions could adversely affect our business. Recent global economic trends pose challenges to our business and could result in declining revenues, profitability and cash flows. Although we continue to devote significant resources to support our brands and market our products at multiple price points, during periods of economic uncertainty consumers may reduce consumption or switch to economy brands, which could reduce sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin product offerings. Additionally, retailers may increase pressure on our selling prices or increase promotional activity for lower-priced or value offerings as they seek to maintain sales volumes and margins.\nWhile we currently generate significant cash flows from ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities, a disruption in the credit markets could negatively impact the availability or cost of funding. Reduced access to credit or increased costs could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital. In addition, if any financial institutions that hold our cash or other investments or that are parties to our revolving credit facilities supporting our commercial paper program or other financing arrangements, such as interest rate or foreign exchange hedging instruments, were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent, they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us. This could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain interest rate, foreign currency or commodity price exposures. In addition, tighter credit markets may lead to business disruptions for certain of our suppliers, contract manufacturers or trade customers which could, in turn, adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur success depends upon our ability to attract and retain key employees and the succession of senior management.\nOur success largely depends on the performance of our management team and other key employees. If we are unable to attract and retain talented, highly qualified senior management and other key people, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, if we are unable to effectively provide for the succession of senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition may be adversely affected. While we follow a disciplined, ongoing succession planning process and have succession plans in place for senior management and other key executives, these do not guarantee that the services of qualified senior executives will continue to be available to us at particular moments in time.\nWe have pursued and may continue to pursue acquisitions and divestitures, which could adversely impact our results.\nWe have pursued and may continue to pursue acquisitions of brands, businesses or technologies from third parties. Acquisitions and their pursuit involve numerous potential risks, including, among other things:\n\u25aa\nrealizing the full extent of the expected benefits or synergies as a result of a transaction, within the anticipated time frame, or at all;\n\u25aa\nsuccessfully integrating the operations, technologies, services, products and systems of the acquired brands or businesses in an effective, timely and cost-efficient manner;\n\u25aa\nreceiving necessary consents, clearances and approvals in connection with a transaction;\n\u25aa\ndiverting management\u2019s attention from other business priorities;\n\u25aa\nsuccessfully operating in new lines of business or markets;\n\u25aa\nretaining key employees, partners, suppliers and customers of the acquired business;\n\u25aa\nconforming standards, controls, procedures and policies of the acquired business with our own;\n\u25aa\ndeveloping or launching products with acquired technologies; and\n\u25aa\nother unanticipated problems or liabilities.\nMoreover, acquisitions could result in substantial additional debt, exposure to contingent liabilities, such as litigation (including for infringement of intellectual property) or earn-out obligations, the potential impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, or transaction costs. Any of these risks, should they materialize, could adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe also may periodically divest brands or businesses. These divestitures may adversely impact our results of operations if we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue associated with the divested brands or businesses, or otherwise achieve the anticipated benefits or cost savings from the divestitures. In addition, businesses under consideration for, or otherwise subject to, divestiture may be adversely impacted prior to the divestiture, which could negatively impact our results of operations.", "PERMNO": 18729, "SIC": 2844, "TIC": "CL"}
