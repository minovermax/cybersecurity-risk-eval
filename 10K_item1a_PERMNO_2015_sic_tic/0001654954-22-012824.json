{"cik": "720875", "company": "DYNATRONICS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-09-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the risks described elsewhere in this report and in certain of our other filings with the SEC, we have identified the following risks and uncertainties, among others, as risks that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by us or by any forward-looking statement contained in this report. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the uncertainty regarding the impact or duration of the Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) virus pandemic that is adversely affecting communities and businesses, including ours. You should consider the following risk factors, in addition to the information presented elsewhere in this report, particularly under the heading \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d on page 1 of this report, and statements and disclosures contained in the sections \u201cPart I, Item 1. Business,\u201d \u201cPart II, Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d as well as in the filings we make from time to time with the SEC, in evaluating us, our business and an investment in our securities. The fact that some of these risk factors may be the same or similar to those that we have included in other reports that we have filed with the SEC in past periods means only that the risks are present in multiple periods. We believe that many of the risks that are described here are part of doing business in the industry in which we operate and will likely be present in all periods. The fact that certain risks are endemic to the industry does not lessen their significance.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe expect to rely on third-party manufacturers and will be dependent on their quality and effectiveness. Our electrotherapy products require precise, high-quality manufacturing. The failure to achieve and maintain high manufacturing standards, including failure to detect or control unexpected events or unanticipated manufacturing errors, or the frequent occurrence of such errors, could result in patient injury or death, delays or failures in product testing or delivery, cost overruns, product recalls or withdrawals and other problems that could seriously hurt our business. Third party manufacturers can encounter difficulties involving manufacturing processes, facilities, operations, production yields, quality control, compliance, and shortages of qualified personnel.\nIf for any reason our third-party manufacturer is unable or unwilling to perform, we may not be able to terminate our agreements with them, and we may not be able to locate alternative manufacturers or enter into favorable agreements with them, nor can we be certain that any such third-parties will have the manufacturing capacity to meet future requirements. If these manufacturers, or any alternate manufacturer, experience any significant difficulties in their respective manufacturing processes for our electrotherapy products, or should these manufacturers cease doing business with us, we could experience significant interruptions in the supply of our electrotherapy products or may not be able to create a supply of our electrotherapy products at all. Were we to encounter manufacturing issues, our ability to produce a sufficient supply of our electrotherapy products might be negatively affected. Our inability to coordinate the efforts of our third-party manufacturer, or the lack of capacity available at our third-party manufacturer, could impair our ability to supply our electrotherapy products at required levels.\nWe cannot guarantee our manufacturing and assembly partners will be able to manufacture our electrotherapy products at commercial scale on a cost-effective basis. If the commercial-scale manufacturing costs of our electrotherapy products are higher than expected, these costs may significantly impact our operating results.\nDisruption of our supply chain could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our ability to make, move, and sell our products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our supply chain, including third-party manufacturing, assembly or transportation and distribution capabilities, due to weather, including any potential effects of climate change, natural disaster, fire or explosion, terrorism, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), strikes, government action, or other reasons beyond our control or the control of our suppliers and business partners, could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, particularly when a product is sourced from a single supplier or location, could adversely affect our business or financial results. In addition, disputes with significant suppliers, including disputes regarding pricing or performance, could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers and could materially and adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn particular, we are actively monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our supply chain and our consolidated results of operations. Due to restrictions resulting from the pandemic, global supply may be constrained, which may cause the price of certain components and raw materials used in our products to increase and/or we may experience disruptions to our operations.\nInflation and price fluctuations of raw materials, energy and other inputs could adversely affect our business. As a manufacturer, our sales and profitability are dependent on the availability and cost of raw materials and labor and other inputs, including energy. All of the raw materials we use are purchased from third parties. Prices for these raw materials are subject to substantial fluctuations that are beyond our control due to factors such as changing economic conditions, pandemics, such as COVID-19, currency and commodity price fluctuations, resource availability, transportation costs, weather conditions and natural disasters, geopolitical risks, including war (such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict) and instability, and other factors impacting supply and demand pressures.\nWhile we have largely been able to successfully manage through these supply disruptions and related price volatility, there is no assurance we will be able to successfully navigate through any ongoing and future disruptions. Increases in costs and disruptions in supply can have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. Although we seek to mitigate these risks through various strategies, including by entering into contracts with certain customers which permit certain price adjustments to reflect increased raw material costs or by otherwise seeking to increase our prices to offset increases in raw material costs and seeking alternative sources of supply for key raw materials, there is no guarantee that we will be able to anticipate or mitigate commodity and input price movements or mitigate supply disruptions. In addition, there may be delays in adjusting prices to correspond with underlying raw material costs and corresponding impacts on our working capital and any failure to anticipate or mitigate against such movements could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, which effect may be material.\nWe are currently operating in a period of economic uncertainty, which has been significantly impacted by geopolitical instability due to the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any negative impact on the global economy from the conflict in Ukraine or any other geopolitical tensions. U.S. and global markets are experiencing volatility and disruption following the escalation of geopolitical tensions and the start of the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. On February 24, 2022, a full-scale military invasion of Ukraine by Russian troops was reported. Although the length and impact of the ongoing military conflict is highly unpredictable, the conflict in Ukraine could lead to market disruptions, including significant volatility in commodity prices, credit and capital markets, as well as supply chain interruptions. We are continuing to monitor the situation in Ukraine and globally and assessing its potential impact on our business.\nAdditionally, the recent military conflict in Ukraine has led to sanctions and other penalties being levied by the United States, European Union and other countries against Russia. Additional potential sanctions and penalties have also been proposed and/or threatened. Russian military actions and the resulting sanctions could adversely affect the global economy and financial markets and lead to instability and lack of liquidity in capital markets, potentially making it more difficult for us to obtain additional funds.\nAlthough our business has not been materially impacted by the ongoing military conflict between Russian and Ukraine to date, it is impossible to predict the extent to which our operations, or those of our suppliers and manufacturers, will be impacted in the short and long term, or the ways in which the conflict may impact our business. The extent and duration of the military action, sanctions and resulting market disruptions are impossible to predict, but could be substantial. Any such disruptions may also magnify the impact of other risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe face risks related to health epidemics and other widespread outbreaks of contagious disease, which could significantly disrupt our manufacturing and impact our operating results. Significant outbreaks of contagious diseases, and other adverse public health developments, could have a material impact on our business operations and operating results. In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus causing respiratory illness emerged in China and spread to other countries, including the United States, and has been deemed a pandemic. Global governments, including local, state and federal government of the United States, have taken certain emergency measures to combat the spread of the virus, including implementation of stay-at-home orders, social distancing, travel bans and closure of factories and businesses. We have implemented guidelines and redundancies to promote employee health and wellness in order to meet our obligations as a manufacturer and infrastructure provider. If our employee health and wellness activities are not fully successful, it could have a material effect on our ability to manufacture products in required quantities. We are closely monitoring the developments and continually assessing the potential impact on our business. Any prolonged disruption to our suppliers, our manufacturing, or our customers could negatively impact our sales, operating results, collection of receivables, and valuation of inventory.\nAny current or future outbreak of a health epidemic or other adverse public health developments, such as the current outbreak of COVID-19, could disrupt our manufacturing and supply chain, and adversely affect our business and operating results. Our business could be adversely affected by the effects of health epidemics. For example, our materials suppliers could be disrupted by conditions related to COVID-19, or other epidemics, possibly resulting in disruption to our supply chain. If our suppliers are unable or fail to fulfill their obligations to us for any reason, we may not be able to manufacture our products and satisfy customer demand or our obligations under sales agreements in a timely manner, and our business could be harmed as a result. At this point in time, there is uncertainty relating to the potential effect of COVID-19 on our business. Infections may become more widespread and should that limit our ability to timely sell and distribute our products or cause supply disruptions, it would have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, a significant health epidemic could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. The extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak continues to impact our financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new government actions or restrictions, new information that may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19, the longevity of COVID-19 and the impact of COVID-19 on economic activity.\nWe have a history of losses, and we may not sustain profitability in the future. Although we had net income in fiscal year 2021, we have incurred net losses for 10 of the 11 previous fiscal years. We cannot predict when we will again achieve profitable operations or that we will not require additional financing to fulfill our business objectives. We may not be able to increase revenue in future periods, and our revenue could decline or grow more slowly than we expect. We may incur significant losses in the future for many reasons, including due to the risks described in this report.\nWe may need additional funding and may be unable to raise additional capital when needed, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In the future, we may require additional capital to pursue business opportunities or acquisitions or respond to challenges and unforeseen circumstances. We may also decide to engage in equity or debt financings or enter into credit facilities for other reasons. We may not be able to secure additional debt or equity financing in a timely manner, on favorable terms, or at all. Any debt financing obtained by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. Failure to obtain additional financing when needed or on acceptable terms would have a material adverse effect on our business operations.\nOur inability to successfully manage growth through acquisitions, and the integration of acquired businesses, products or technologies may present significant challenges and could harm our operating results. Our business plan includes the acquisition of other businesses, products, and technologies. In the future we expect to acquire or invest in businesses, products or technologies that we believe could complement our existing product lines, expand our customer base and operations, and enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth or cost-saving opportunities. As we grow through acquisitions, we face additional challenges of integrating the operations, personnel, culture, information management systems and other characteristics of the acquired entity with our own. Efforts to integrate future acquisitions may be hampered by delays, the loss of certain employees, changes in management, suppliers or customers, proceedings resulting from employment terminations, culture clashes, unbudgeted costs, and other issues, which may occur at levels that are more severe or prolonged than anticipated. If we identify an appropriate acquisition candidate, we may not be successful in negotiating favorable terms of the acquisition, financing the acquisition or effectively integrating the acquired business, product or technology into our existing business and operations. Our due diligence may fail to identify all of the problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired business, product or technology, including issues related to intellectual property, product quality or product architecture, regulatory compliance practices, revenue recognition or other accounting practices, or employee or customer issues.\nWe have incurred, and will likely continue to incur, expenses in connection with negotiating and consummating acquisitions. We may not achieve the synergies or other benefits we expected to achieve. And we may incur write-downs, impairment charges or unforeseen liabilities, all of which could negatively affect our operating results or financial position or could otherwise harm our business. If we finance acquisitions by issuing convertible debt or equity securities, the ownership interest of our existing shareholders may be significantly diluted, which could adversely affect the market price of our stock. Further, contemplating, investigating, negotiating or completing an acquisition and integrating an acquired business, product or technology could divert management and employee time and resources from other matters that are important to our existing business.\nIf we fail to establish new sales and distribution relationships or maintain our existing relationships, or if our third party distributors and dealers fail to commit sufficient time and effort or are otherwise ineffective in selling our products, our results of operations and future growth could be adversely impacted. The sale and distribution of certain of our products depend, in part, on our relationships with a network of third-party distributors and dealers. These third-party distributors and dealers maintain the customer relationships with the hospitals, clinics, orthopedists, physical therapists and other healthcare professionals that purchase, use and recommend the use of our products. Although our internal sales staff trains and manages these third-party distributors and dealers, we do not control or directly monitor the efforts that they make to sell our products. In addition, some of the dealers that we use to sell our products also sell products that directly compete with our core product offerings. These dealers may not dedicate the necessary effort to market and sell our products. If we fail to attract and maintain relationships with third-party distributors and dealers or fail to adequately train and monitor the efforts of the third-party distributors and dealers that market and sell our products, or if our existing third-party distributors and dealers choose not to carry our products, our results of operations and future growth could be adversely affected.\nHealthcare reform in the United States has had and is expected to continue to have a significant effect on our business and on our ability to expand and grow our business. The Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, significantly expanded health insurance coverage to uninsured Americans and changed the way health care is financed by both governmental and private payers. These provisions may be modified, repealed, or otherwise invalidated, in whole or in part. Future rulemaking could affect rebates, prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, or required reporting and disclosure. We cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking or changes in the law.\nOur products are regulated by numerous government agencies, both inside and outside the United States. The impact of this factor on us is direct, to the extent we are subject to these laws and regulations, and indirect in that in a number of situations, even though we may not be directly regulated by specific healthcare laws and regulations, our products must be capable of being used by our customers in a manner that complies with those laws and regulations. The manufacture, distribution, marketing, and use of some of our products are subject to extensive regulation and increased scrutiny by the FDA and other regulatory authorities globally. Any new Class II product must undergo lengthy and rigorous testing and other extensive, costly and time-consuming procedures mandated by FDA and foreign regulatory authorities. Changes to current Class II products may be subject to vigorous review, including additional 510(k) and other regulatory submissions, and marketing clearances are not certain. Our facilities must be registered prior to production and remain subject to inspection from time to time thereafter. Failure to comply with the requirements of FDA or other regulatory authorities, including a failed inspection or a failure in our adverse event reporting system, could result in adverse inspection reports, warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt the manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal of a government to grant approvals or licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. Any of these actions could cause a loss of customer confidence in us and our products, which could adversely affect our sales. The requirements of regulatory authorities, including interpretative guidance, are subject to change and compliance with additional or changing requirements or interpretative guidance may subject us or our products to further review, result in product launch delays or otherwise increase our costs.\nChanging market patterns may affect demand for our products. Increasingly, medical markets are moving toward evidence-based practices. Such a move could shrink demand for products we offer if it is deemed there is inadequate evidence to support the efficacy of the products. Likewise, to achieve market acceptance in such environments may require expenditure of funds to do clinical research that may or may not prove adequate efficacy to satisfy all customers.\nThe cost of healthcare has risen significantly over the past decade and numerous initiatives and reforms initiated by legislators, regulators and third-party payers to curb these costs have resulted in a consolidation trend in the restorative products industry as well as among our customers, including healthcare providers. These conditions could result in greater pricing pressures and limitations on our ability to sell to important market segments, such as group purchasing organizations, integrated delivery networks and large single accounts. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide healthcare industry, resulting in further business consolidations and alliances which may exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe sale, marketing, and pricing of our products, and relationships with healthcare providers are under increased scrutiny by federal, state, and foreign government agencies. Compliance with anti-kickback statutes, false claims laws, the FDC Act (including as these laws relate to off-label promotion of products), and other healthcare related laws, as well as competition, data and patient privacy, and export and import laws, is under increased focus by the agencies charged with overseeing such activities, including FDA, the Office of Inspector General (OIG), Department of Justice (DOJ) and the FTC. The DOJ and the SEC have increased their focus on the enforcement of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) described below under \u201cOur commercial activities internationally are subject to special risks associated with doing business in environments that present a heightened corruption and trade sanctions risk.\u201d The laws and standards governing the promotion, sale, and reimbursement related to our products and laws and regulations governing our relationships with healthcare providers and governments can be complicated, are subject to frequent change and may be violated unknowingly. Violations or allegations of violations of these laws may result in large civil and criminal penalties, debarment from participating in government programs, diversion of management time, attention and resources and may otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In the event of a violation, or the allegation of a violation of these laws, we may incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of our sales and marketing practices and we may be subject to enforcement actions which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur commercial activities internationally are subject to special risks associated with doing business in environments and jurisdictions that present a heightened corruption and trade sanctions risk. We operate our business and market and sell products internationally, including in countries in Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East, which may be considered business environments that pose a relatively higher risk of corruption than the United States, and therefore present greater political, economic and operational risk to us, including an increased risk of trade sanction violations. In addition, there are numerous risks inherent in conducting our business internationally, including, but not limited to, potential instability in international markets, changes in regulatory requirements applicable to international operations, currency fluctuations in foreign countries, political, economic and social conditions in foreign countries and complex U.S. and foreign laws and treaties, including tax laws, the FCPA, and the Bribery Act of 2010 (\u201cU.K. Anti-Bribery Act\u201d). The FCPA prohibits U.S.-based companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also imposes recordkeeping and internal controls requirements on public companies in the U.S. The U.K. Anti-Bribery Act prohibits both domestic and international bribery as well as bribery across both public and private sectors. In recent years, the number of investigations and other enforcement activities under these laws has increased. As we expand our business to include pursuit of opportunities in certain parts of the world that experience government corruption, in certain circumstances compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Our policies mandate compliance with all applicable anti-bribery laws. Further, we require our partners, subcontractors, agents and others who work for us or on our behalf to comply with these and other anti-bribery laws. If we fail to enforce our policies and procedures properly or maintain adequate record-keeping and internal accounting practices to accurately record our transactions, we may be subject to regulatory sanctions. In the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees have or may have violated applicable anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, trade sanctions or other laws or regulations, we are required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances, and if violations are found or suspected, could face civil and criminal penalties, and significant costs for investigations, litigation, settlements and judgments, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf significant tariffs or other restrictions are placed on imports or any related counter-measures are taken by foreign countries, our revenue and results of operations may be materially harmed. Potential changes in international trade relations between the United States and other countries could have a material adverse effect on our business. There is currently significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United States and various other countries, with respect to trade policies, treaties, government regulations and tariffs. The U.S. government has adopted a new approach to trade policy including in some cases to renegotiate, or potentially terminate, certain existing bilateral or multi-lateral trade agreements. The U.S. government has also imposed tariffs on certain foreign goods. These measures may materially increase costs for goods imported into the United States. This in turn could require us to materially increase prices to our customers which may reduce demand, or, if we are unable to increase prices to adequately address any tariffs, quotas or duties result in lowering our margin on products sold. Changes in U.S. trade policy have resulted in, and could result in more, U.S. trading partners adopting responsive trade policies, including imposition of increased tariffs, quotas or duties, making it more difficult or costly for us to export our products to those countries. The implementation of a border tax, tariff or higher customs duties on our products manufactured abroad or components that we import into the U.S., or any potential corresponding actions by other countries in which we do business, could negatively impact our financial performance.\nIf we fail to obtain regulatory approval in foreign jurisdictions, then we cannot market our products in those jurisdictions. We sell some of our products in foreign jurisdictions. Many foreign countries in which we market or may market our products have regulatory bodies and restrictions similar to those of the FDA. International sales are subject to foreign government regulation, the requirements of which vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance and the requirements may differ. Companies are now required to obtain a CE Mark, which shows conformance with the requirements of applicable European Conformity directives, prior to the sale of some medical devices within the European Union. Some of our current products that require CE Markings have them and it is anticipated that additional and future products may require them as well. We may be required to conduct additional testing or to provide additional information, resulting in additional expenses, to obtain necessary approvals. If we fail to obtain approval in such foreign jurisdictions, we would not be able to sell our products in such jurisdictions, thereby reducing the potential revenue from the sale of our products.\nWe store, process, and use data, some of which contain personal information and are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection and other matters, which are subject to change. Some of the data we store, process, and use, contains personal information, subjecting us to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and other countries with respect to privacy, rights of publicity, data protection, content, protection of minors, and consumer protection. These laws can be particularly restrictive. Both in the United States and abroad, these laws and regulations are evolving and remain subject to change. Several proposals are pending before federal, state and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies that could significantly affect our business. A number of states have enacted laws or are considering the enactment of laws governing the release of credit card or other personal information received from consumers:\n\u25cf\nCalifornia has enacted legislation, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) that, among other things, requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers, and afford such consumers new abilities to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020.\n\u25cf\nThe EU General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), effective May, 2018, establishes new requirements applicable to the processing of personal data (i.e., data which identifies an individual or from which an individual is identifiable), affords new data protection rights to individuals, and imposes penalties for serious data breaches. Individuals also have a right to compensation under GDPR for financial or non-financial losses. GDPR has imposed additional responsibility and liability in relation to our processing of personal data in the EU. GDPR has also required us to change our various policies and procedures in the EU and, if we are not compliant, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\u25cf\nCanada\u2019s Personal Information and Protection of Electronic Documents Act provides Canadian residents with privacy protections in regard to transactions with businesses and organizations in the private sector and sets out ground rules for how private sector organizations may collect, use, and disclose personal information in the course of commercial activities.\n\u25cf\nIn November 2016, the Standing Committee of China\u2019s National People\u2019s Congress passed its Cybersecurity Law (\u201cCSL\u201d), which took effect in June 2017. The CSL is the first Chinese law that systematically lays out regulatory requirements on cybersecurity and data protection, subjecting many previously under-regulated or unregulated activities in cyberspace to government scrutiny.\nThe costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, the GDPR, CSL and related laws may limit the use and adoption of our products and services and could have an adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Foreign governments also may attempt to apply such laws extraterritorially or through treaties or other arrangements with U.S. governmental entities. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain and could result in investigations, claims, changes to our business practices, increased cost of operations and declines in sales, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We cannot assure you that the privacy policies and other statements regarding our practices will be found sufficient to protect us from liability or adverse publicity relating to the privacy and security of personal information. Whether and how existing local and international privacy and consumer protection laws in various jurisdictions apply to the internet and other online technologies is still uncertain and may take years to resolve. Privacy laws and regulations, if drafted or interpreted broadly, could be deemed to apply to the technology we use and could restrict our information collection methods or decrease the amount and utility of the information that we would be permitted to collect. A determination by a court or government agency of a failure, or perceived failure, by us, the third parties with whom we work or our products and services to protect employee, applicant, vendor, website visitor or customer personal data (including as a result of a breach by or of a third-party provider) or to comply with any privacy-related laws, government regulations or directives or industry self-regulatory principles or our posted privacy policies could result in damage to our reputation, legal proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or otherwise, which could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure, or security of personally identifiable information or other privacy-related matters, even if unfounded and even if we are in compliance with applicable laws, could damage our reputation and harm our business. We have and post on our website our own privacy policy and cookie statement concerning the collection, use and disclosure of user personal data.\nFailures in, material damage to, or interruptions in our information technology systems, software or websites, including as a result of cyber-attacks, and difficulties in updating our existing software or developing or implementing new software, could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. We depend increasingly on our information technology systems in the conduct of our business. For example, we own, license or otherwise contract for sophisticated technology and systems to do business online with customers, including for order entry and fulfillment, processing and payment, product shipping and product returns. We also maintain internal and external communications, product inventory, supply, production and enterprise management, and personnel information on information systems. Our information systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches and natural and man-made disasters. In particular, from time to time we and third parties who provide services for us experience cyber-attacks, attempted breaches of our or their information technology systems and networks or similar events, which could result in a loss of sensitive business or customer information, systems interruption or the disruption of our operations. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, and accordingly we may be unable to anticipate and prevent all data security incidents. Like many businesses, our systems come under frequent attack from third parties. We are required to expend capital and other resources to protect against such cyber-attacks and potential security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such potential breaches or attacks. Despite the constant monitoring of our technology systems and hiring of specialized third parties to identify and address any vulnerabilities through implementation of multi-tiered network security measures, it is possible that computer programmers and hackers, or even internal users, may be able to penetrate, create systems disruptions or cause shutdowns of our network security or that of third-party companies with which we have contracted. As a result, we could experience significant disruptions of our operations and incur significant expenses addressing problems created by these breaches. Such unauthorized access could disrupt our business and could result in a loss of revenue or assets and any compromise of customer information could subject us to customer or government litigation and harm our reputation, which could adversely affect our business and growth. Although we maintain cyber liability insurance that provides liability and insurance coverages, subject to limitations and conditions of the policies, our insurance may not be sufficient to protect against all losses or costs related to any future breaches of our systems.\nMarket access could be a limiting factor in our growth. The emergence of GPO\u2019s that control a significant amount of product flow to hospitals and other acute care customers may limit our ability to grow in the acute care space. GPO\u2019s issue contracts to manufacturers approximately every three years through a bidding process. We have been relatively unsuccessful in landing any significant GPO contracts. The process for being placed on contract with a GPO is rigorous and non-transparent.\nA significant percentage of our workforce is subject to a collective bargaining agreement. Approximately 34% of our workforce is subject to a collective bargaining agreement, which is subject to negotiation and renewal every three years. The current agreement is scheduled to expire in February 2025. Our inability to negotiate the renewal of this collective bargaining agreement, or any prolonged work stoppages, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We cannot ensure that we will be successful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements, that such negotiations will not result in significant increases in the cost of labor, or that a breakdown in such negotiations will not result in the disruption of our operations. In addition, employees who are not currently represented by labor unions may seek representation in the future. Although we have generally enjoyed good relations with both our union and non-union employees, if we are subject to labor actions, we may experience an adverse impact on our operating results.\nWe rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, and nondisclosure and non-competition agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property, and we will continue to do so. While we intend to defend against any threats to our intellectual property, these patents, trade secrets, or other agreements may not adequately protect our intellectual property. Third parties could obtain patents that may require us to negotiate licenses to conduct our business, and the required licenses may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. We also rely on nondisclosure and non-competition agreements with certain employees, consultants, and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary rights. We cannot be certain that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information, or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary knowledge.\nCertain of the products we sell are subject to market and technological obsolescence. We currently offer approximately 4,500 products or variations of products. If our customers discontinue purchasing a given product, we might have to record expense related to the diminution in value of inventories we have in stock, and depending on the magnitude, that expense could adversely impact our operating results. We may be unable to effectively develop and market products against the products of our competitors in a highly competitive industry. Our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by our competitors. Competitive factors include price, customer service, technology, innovation, quality, reputation and reliability. Our competition may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies, undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, have greater financial, marketing and other resources than us or be more successful in attracting potential customers, employees and strategic partners. Given these factors, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue our level of success in the industry.\nWe are dependent on a limited number of third-party suppliers for components and raw materials and the loss of any of these suppliers, or their inability to provide us with an adequate supply of materials that meet our quality and other requirements, could harm our business. We rely on third-party suppliers to provide components for our products, manufacture products that we do not manufacture ourselves and perform services that we do not provide ourselves, including package-delivery services. Because these suppliers are independent third parties with their own financial objectives, actions taken by them could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations. The risks of relying on suppliers include our inability to enter into contracts with such suppliers on reasonable terms, breach, or termination by suppliers of their contractual obligations, inconsistent or inadequate quality control, relocation of supplier facilities, and disruption to suppliers\u2019 business, including work stoppages, suppliers\u2019 failure to comply with complex and changing regulations, and third-party financial failure. Any problems with our suppliers and associated disruptions to our supply chain could materially negatively impact our ability to supply the market, substantially decrease sales, lead to higher costs, or damage our reputation with our customers, and any longer-term disruptions could potentially result in the permanent loss of our customers, which could reduce our recurring revenues and long-term profitability. Disruption to our supply chain could occur as a result of any number of events, including, but not limited to, increases in wages that drive up prices; the imposition of regulations, trade protection measures, tariffs, duties, import/export restrictions, quotas or embargoes on key components; labor stoppages; transportation failures affecting the supply and shipment of materials and finished goods; the unavailability of raw materials; severe weather conditions; natural disasters; civil unrest, geopolitical developments, war or terrorism; computer viruses, physical or electronic breaches, or other information system disruptions or security breaches; and disruptions in utility and other services.\nWe may be adversely affected by product liability claims, unfavorable court decisions or legal settlements. Our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices. We maintain product liability insurance coverage which we deem to be adequate based on historical experience; however, there can be no assurance that coverage will be available for such risks in the future or that, if available, it would prove sufficient to cover potential claims or that the present amount of insurance can be maintained in force at an acceptable cost. In addition, we may incur significant legal expenses regardless of whether we are found to be liable. Furthermore, the assertion of such claims, regardless of their merit or eventual outcome, also may have a material adverse effect on our business reputation and results of operations.\nIntellectual property litigation and infringement claims could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling certain of our products. The medical device industry is characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation and, from time to time, we are the subject of claims by third parties of potential infringement or misappropriation. Regardless of outcome, such claims are expensive to defend and divert the time and effort of management and operating personnel from other business issues. A successful claim or claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us could result in our payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments or negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products in the affected category.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nA decline in the price of our common stock could affect our ability to raise working capital and adversely impact our operations. Our operating results, including components of operating results such as gross margin and cost of product sales, may fluctuate from time to time, and such fluctuations could adversely affect our stock price. Our operating results have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to fluctuate from time to time in the future. The market price for our common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet or exceed expectations of analysts or investors. Any failure to meet these expectations, even if minor, could materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock. A prolonged decline in the price of our common stock for any reason could result in a reduction in our ability to raise capital.\nOur stock price has been volatile and we expect that it will continue to be volatile. For example, during the year ended June 30, 2022, the selling price of our common stock ranged from a high of $1.79 to a low of $0.43. The volatility of our stock price can be due to many factors, including:\n\u25cf\nquarterly variations in our operating results;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the market\u2019s expectations about our operating results;\n\u25cf\nfailure of our operating results to meet the expectation of securities analysts or investors in a particular period;\n\u25cf\nchanges in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts concerning us or the healthcare industry in general;\n\u25cf\nstrategic decisions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestments, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments or changes in business strategy;\n\u25cf\noperating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u25cf\nnews reports relating to trends in our markets;\n\u25cf\nchanges in laws and regulations affecting our business;\n\u25cf\nmaterial announcements by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nmaterial announcements by the manufacturers and suppliers we use;\n\u25cf\nsales of substantial amounts of our common stock by our directors, executive officers or significant shareholders or the perception that such sales could occur; and\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic and political conditions such as trade wars and tariffs, recession, and acts of war or terrorism.\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic has increased capital markets volatility. The global stock markets have experienced, and may continue to experience, significant volatility as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the price of our common stock has been volatile. The COVID-19 pandemic and the significant uncertainties it has caused for the global economy, business activity, and business confidence have had, and are likely to continue to have, a significant effect on the market price of securities generally, including our securities. For example, in the 12 months ended June 30, 2022, the sales price on The NASDAQ Capital Market for our common stock ranged from a low of $0.43 to a high of $1.79 per share. Broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, most of which we cannot control, including, among others, the current and future public response and investor reaction to rumors or factual reports of global events, terrorism, outbreaks of disease and other natural disasters, such as the COVID-19 or coronavirus pandemic and the other factors discussed in this report and in our other reports and documents filed with the SEC.\nInvestors in our securities may experience substantial dilution upon the conversion of preferred stock to common, exercise of stock options and warrants, future issuances of stock, grants of restricted stock and the issuance of stock in connection with acquisitions of other companies. Our articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of up to 100,000,000 shares of common stock and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock. Our Board of Directors has the authority to issue additional shares of common and preferred stock up to the authorized capital stated in the articles of incorporation. The Board may choose to issue some or all of such shares of common or preferred stock to acquire one or more businesses or to provide additional financing in the future. As of June 30, 2022, we had outstanding a total of 1,992,000 shares of Series A 8% Convertible Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries A Preferred\u201d), and 1,359,000 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries B Preferred\u201d), as well as warrants for the purchase of approximately 4,323,500 shares of common stock. The Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred shares are convertible into a total of 3,351,000 shares of common stock. The conversion of these outstanding shares of preferred stock and the exercise of the warrants would result in substantial dilution to our common shareholders. In addition, from time to time, we have issued and we expect we will continue to issue stock options or restricted stock grants or similar awards to employees, officers, and directors pursuant to our equity incentive award plans. Investors in our equity securities may expect to experience dilution as these awards vest and are exercised by their holders and as the restrictions lapse on the restricted stock grants. We also may issue stock or stock purchase warrants for the purpose of raising capital to fund our growth initiatives, in connection with acquisitions of other companies, or in connection with the settlement of obligations or indebtedness, which would result in further dilution of existing shareholders. The issuance of any such shares of common or preferred stock may result in a reduction of the book value or market price of the outstanding shares of our common stock. If we do issue any such additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for the purchase of common stock, such issuance also will cause a reduction in the proportionate ownership and voting power of all other shareholders and may result in a change in control of the Company.\nThe stock markets (including the NASDAQ Capital Market, on which we list our common stock) have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. As a result, the market price of our common stock could be similarly volatile, and investors in our common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares, including decreases unrelated to our financial condition, operating performance or prospects. The market price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of factors, including strategic decisions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestments, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments or changes in business strategy.\nWe are able to issue shares of preferred stock with greater rights and preferences than our common stock. Our Board of Directors is authorized to issue one or more series of preferred stock from time to time without any action on the part of our shareholders. The Board also has the power, without shareholder approval, to set the terms of any such series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights and preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends and other terms. If we issue additional preferred stock in the future that has a preference over our common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or other terms, or if we issue additional preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock, the rights of holders of our common stock or the market price of our common stock would be adversely affected.\nThe holders of the Series A and Series B Preferred are entitled to receive dividends on the Series A and Series B Preferred they hold and depending on whether these dividends are paid in cash or stock, the payment of such dividends will either decrease cash that is available to us to invest in our business or dilute the holdings of other shareholders. Our agreements with the holders of the Series A and Series B Preferred provide that they will receive quarterly dividends at 8%, subject to adjustment as provided in the applicable declarations of the rights and preferences of these series of preferred stock. We may under certain circumstances elect to pay these dividends in stock. Payment of the dividends in cash decreases cash available to us for use in our business and the use of shares of common stock to pay these dividends results in dilution of our existing shareholders.\nThe concentration or potential concentration of equity ownership by Prettybrook Partners, LLC and its affiliates may limit your ability to influence corporate matters. As of June 30, 2022, Prettybrook Partners, LLC and its managing directors and affiliates (collectively \u201cPrettybrook\u201d), owned approximately 2,095,000 shares of common stock, 1,070,000 shares of Series A Preferred, and 300,000 shares of Series B Preferred. These securities represent approximately 15% of the voting power of our issued and outstanding equity securities. Under the terms of the Series A Preferred, by agreement with us and the remaining holders of the Series A Preferred, Prettybrook has the right to appoint up to three members of our seven-member Board of Directors (the Preferred Directors) and has appointed a non-voting observer to the Board. Moreover, the exercise of warrants issued to Prettybrook in the Series A Preferred financing and the Series B Preferred financing transactions in which Prettybrook was an investor could further enable Prettybrook to exert significant control over operations and influence over all corporate activities, including the election or removal of directors and the outcome of tender offers, mergers, proxy contests or other purchases of common stock that could give our shareholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price for their shares of common stock. This concentrated control will limit your ability to influence corporate matters and, as a result, we may take actions that our shareholders do not view as beneficial. In addition, such concentrated control could discourage others from initiating changes of control. In such cases, the perception of our prospects in the market and the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nSales of a large number of our securities, or the perception that such sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock. A substantial number of shares of our equity securities are eligible for immediate resale in the public market. Any sales of substantial amounts of our securities in the public market, or the perception that such sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock.\nOur ability to issue preferred stock could delay or prevent takeover attempts. As of June 30, 2022, we had 3,351,000 shares of convertible preferred stock outstanding and our Board of Directors has the authority to cause us to issue, without any further vote or action by the shareholders, up to approximately 46,649,000 additional shares of preferred stock, no par value per share, in one or more series, and to designate the number of shares constituting any series, and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof, including dividend rights, voting rights, rights and terms of redemption, redemption price or prices and liquidation preferences of such series of preferred stock. In the event of issuance, the preferred stock could be used as a method of discouraging, delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control without further action by the shareholders, even where shareholders might be offered a premium for their shares. Although we have no present intention to issue any shares of our preferred stock, we may do so in the future under appropriate circumstances.\nThe NASDAQ Capital Market may delist our common stock from its exchange which could limit your ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions. Our common stock is listed for trading on NASDAQ under the symbol \u201cDYNT\u201d. On February 24, 2022, we were notified by NASDAQ (the \u201cDeficiency Notice\u201d) that for 30 consecutive business days, the bid price of the common stock had closed below $1.00 per share, in violation of NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the \u201cMinimum Bid Price Requirement\u201d). On August 24, 2022, we received notice from NASDAQ indicating that while we had not regained compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, the Listing Qualifications Department (the \u201cStaff\u201d) has determined that we are eligible for an additional 180 calendar day period to regain compliance (the \u201cSecond 180 Day Compliance Period\u201d). The Staff indicated that its determination is based on the Company meeting the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares, and all other applicable requirements for initial listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market with the exception of the bid price requirement, and the Company\u2019s written notice of its intention to cure the deficiency during the Second 180 Day Compliance Period by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary. If at any time during the Second 180 Day Compliance Period the closing bid price of our Common Stock is at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, the Staff will provide written confirmation of compliance. In our upcoming annual shareholder meeting, we will request shareholder approval to authorize our board of directors to effect a reverse stock split of our common stock at any time within one year from the date of shareholder approval, in the sole discretion of the board of directors, pursuant to an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation.\nIf we do not regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement by the end of the Second 180 Day Compliance Period our common stock will be subject to delisting. At such time, we may appeal NASDAQ\u2019s delisting determination. Delisting could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity and on the trading of our common stock. If our common stock were delisted, our common stock could be quoted on the OTCQB market or on the \u201cpink sheets\u201d maintained by the OTC Markets Group. However, such alternatives are generally considered to be less efficient markets. Further, delisting from NASDAQ could also have other negative effects, including potential loss of confidence by partners, lenders, suppliers and employees, and could also trigger various defaults under our lending agreements and other outstanding agreements. Delisting could make it more difficult for the Company to attract qualified Board candidates and potential strategic and collaborative partners. Finally, delisting could make it harder for us to raise capital and sell securities as we would no longer be eligible to use Form S-3 short form registration statements for such purposes.\nIf our common stock is delisted, our common stock would likely then trade only in the over-the-counter market. If our common stock were to trade on the over-the-counter market, selling our common stock could be more difficult because smaller quantities of shares would likely be bought and sold, transactions could be delayed, and we could face significant material adverse consequences, including: a limited availability of market quotations for our securities; reduced liquidity with respect to our securities; a determination that our shares are a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d which will require brokers trading in our securities to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities; a reduced amount of news and analyst coverage for our Company; and a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future. These factors could result in lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for our common stock and would substantially impair our ability to raise additional funds and could result in a loss of institutional investor interest and fewer development opportunities for us.\nIn addition to the foregoing, if our common stock is delisted from NASDAQ and it trades on the over-the-counter market, the application of the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and increase the transaction costs to sell those shares. The SEC has adopted regulations which generally define a \u201cpenny stock\u201d as an equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to specific exemptions. If our common stock is delisted from NASDAQ and it trades on the over-the-counter market at a price of less than $5.00 per share, our common stock would be considered a penny stock. The SEC\u2019s penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, before a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer must also provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and the salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer\u2019s account. In addition, the penny stock rules generally require that before a transaction in a penny stock occurs, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s agreement to the transaction. If applicable in the future, these rules may restrict the ability of brokers-dealers to sell our common stock and may affect the ability of investors to sell their shares, until our common stock no longer is considered a penny stock.\nA reverse stock split may negatively impact the market for our common stock. Although we expect that a reverse stock split will result in an increase in the market price of our common stock, we cannot assure you that a reverse stock split, if effected, will increase the market price of our common stock in proportion to the reduction in the number of shares of our common stock outstanding, or result in a permanent increase in the market price. The effect that a reverse stock split may have upon the market price of our common stock cannot be predicted with any certainty, and the history of similar reverse stock splits for companies in similar circumstances to ours is varied. The market price of our common stock is dependent on many factors, including our business and financial performance, general market conditions, prospects for future growth and other factors detailed from time to time in the reports we file with the SEC. Accordingly, the total market capitalization of our common stock after a reverse stock split may be lower than the total market capitalization before a reverse stock split and, in the future, the market price of our common stock following a reverse stock split may not exceed or remain higher than the market price prior to a reverse stock split.\nThe market price of our common stock may not rise after a reverse stock split. Although the Board believes that the decrease in the number of shares of common stock outstanding as a consequence of a reverse stock split and the anticipated increase in the market price of common stock could encourage interest in our common stock and possibly promote greater liquidity for shareholders, such liquidity could also be adversely affected by the reduced number of shares outstanding after a reverse stock split. It is possible that the per share price of our common stock after a reverse stock split will not rise in proportion to the reduction in the number of shares of our common stock outstanding resulting from a reverse stock split, and the market price per post-reverse stock split share may not exceed or remain in excess of the $1.00 minimum bid price for a sustained period of time, and a reverse stock split may not result in a per share price that would attract brokers and investors who do not trade in lower priced stocks. Even if we effect a reverse stock split, the market price of our common stock may decrease due to factors unrelated to a reverse stock split. In any case, the market price of our common stock may also be based on other factors which may be unrelated to the number of shares outstanding, including our future performance. If a reverse stock split is consummated and the trading price of the common stock declines, the percentage decline as an absolute number and as a percentage of our overall market capitalization may be greater than would occur in the absence of a reverse stock split. Even if the market price per post-reverse stock split share of our common stock remains in excess of $1.00 per share, we may be delisted due to a failure to meet other continued listing requirements, including NASDAQ requirements related to the minimum shareholders\u2019 equity, the minimum number of shares that must be in the public float, the minimum market value of the public float and the minimum number of round lot holders.\nA reverse stock split may decrease the liquidity of our common stock. The liquidity of our common stock may be harmed by a reverse stock split given the reduced number of shares of common stock that would be outstanding after a reverse stock split, particularly if the stock price does not increase as a result of a reverse stock split. In addition, investors might consider the increased proportion of unissued authorized shares of common stock to issued shares to have an anti-takeover effect under certain circumstances, because the proportion allows for dilutive issuances which could prevent certain shareholders from changing the composition of the Board or render tender offers for a combination with another entity more difficult to successfully complete. The Board does not intend for a reverse stock split to have any anti-takeover effects.\nThe number of authorized but unissued shares will not change, while the number of issued shares decreases, effectively increasing the number of shares of common stock available for future issuance and potential dilution to existing shareholders. Our Articles of Incorporation presently authorize 100,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 50,000,000 shares of blank check preferred stock, no par value per share. A reverse stock split would not change the number of authorized shares of the common stock, although a reverse stock split would decrease the number of issued and outstanding shares of common stock. Therefore, because the number of issued and outstanding shares of common stock would decrease, the number of shares of common stock remaining available for issuance by us in the future would increase.", "PERMNO": 31051, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "DYNT"}
