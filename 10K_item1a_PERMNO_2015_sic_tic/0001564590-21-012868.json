RISK FACTORS\nA description of the risks and uncertainties associated with our business and ownership of our common stock is set forth below. You should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d The occurrence of any of the events or developments described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and growth prospects. In such an event, the market price of our common stock could decline. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. This Annual Report on Form 10-K also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including the risks described below. See \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nRisk Factor Summary\nBelow is a summary of the principal factors that make an investment in our common stock speculative or subject to risk. This summary does not address all of the risks facing our business. You should consider the risks in this summary together with the detailed discussion of risks that immediately follows this summary in this section titled \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d as well as the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\u2022\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and resulting global economic downturn, has impacted how we, our customers, and our partners are operating, and could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\n\u2022\nWe have a limited history of operating at our current scale and under our current strategy, which makes it difficult to predict our future operating results, and we may not achieve our expected operating results in the future.\n\u2022\nOur recent revenue growth rates may not be indicative of our future performance or growth.\n\u2022\nWe have a history of net losses, we anticipate increasing our operating expenses in the future, and we do not expect to be profitable for the near future.\n\u2022\nOur quarterly results may fluctuate significantly and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business.\n\u2022\nWe have experienced rapid growth and expect to continue to invest in our growth in the future. If we fail to manage our growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan, maintain high levels of service, or adequately address competitive challenges and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\n\u2022\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from a single software platform and if our platform fails to satisfy customer demands or to achieve widespread market acceptance it would adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, and growth prospects.\n\u2022\nIf we are unable to attract new customers, both domestically and internationally, the growth of our revenue will be adversely affected and our business may be harmed.\n\u2022\nOur business depends substantially on our customers renewing their subscriptions and expanding their use of our platform. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions, if they renew on less favorable terms, or if they fail to add more users in more functional areas or upgrade to a higher level of functionality on our platform, our business and operating results will be adversely affected.\n\u2022\nFailure to effectively expand our sales and marketing capabilities, including to hire and retain direct sales personnel, could harm our ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our service.\n\u2022\nOur growth depends in part on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties and their continued performance.\n\u2022\nIf our customers and partners do not have access to highly skilled and trained users of our platform, our customers may not be able to unlock the full potential of our platform, customer satisfaction may suffer, and our results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects may be adversely affected.\n\u2022\nIf we fail to continue to enhance our platform, satisfy the cloud infrastructure priorities of our clients or adapt to rapid technological change, our ability to remain competitive could be impaired.\n\u2022\nIf we experience a security incident affecting our platform, networks, systems or data or the data of our customers, or are perceived to have experienced such a security incident, our platform may be perceived as not being secure, our reputation may be harmed, customers may reduce the use of or stop using our platform, we may incur significant liabilities, and our business could be materially adversely affected.\n\u2022\nReal or perceived errors, failures, bugs, service outages, or disruptions in our platform could adversely affect our reputation and harm our business.\n\u2022\nWe depend on the experience and expertise of our senior management team and certain key employees, especially engineering, research and development and sales personnel, and our inability to retain these executive officers and key employees or recruit them in a timely manner, could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\n\u2022\nThe markets in which we participate are intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\n\u2022\nBecause we collect, process and store personal information and furthermore, because our platform could be used by customers to do the same, evolving domestic and international privacy and security laws, regulations and other obligations could result in additional costs and liabilities to us or inhibit sales of our platform.\nIf we are unable to adequately address these and other risks we face, our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects may be adversely affected.\nOperational Risks\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and resulting global economic downturn, has impacted how we, our customers, and our partners are operating, and could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to persist. Precautionary measures designed to prevent the spread of COVID-19, such as travel restrictions, shelter-in-place orders, and business shutdowns, remain in place in many of the regions in which we conduct business, and new or more restrictive measures have been and may continue to be adopted if the pandemic worsens. These factors have increased economic and financial market volatility and uncertainty. Although multiple vaccines to protect against COVID-19 have been approved for use by various governments, the production and distribution of such vaccines, and inoculation of a sufficient segment of the population to contain the pandemic, may require a significant amount of time and is subject to uncertainties including the ability of pharmaceutical companies to quickly increase vaccine production and the willingness of the general population to be\nvaccinated. As such, the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and the degree of its impact on our business remains uncertain and difficult to predict.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to operate in a modified manner employing precautionary measures designed to protect the health of our employees while enabling us to support our customers and partners. Among other modifications, we continue to require our employees to work remotely, to maintain business-related travel restrictions, and to virtualize, postpone or cancel our sales and marketing, employee or industry events. These modifications have and may continue to result in inefficiencies, delays and additional costs in our sales and marketing, professional services and research and development efforts, which could have an adverse effect on our operations. The remote work measures that we implemented have generally allowed us to provide uninterrupted service to our customers, but have affected the way we conduct our sales, research and development, testing, customer support, and other activities. While we have not observed significant impacts to the productivity of our workforce, working remotely poses additional operational challenges that may impact productivity in the future. Working remotely has made our employees more reliant on cloud-based communication services, and if those services are interrupted, or are less secure, employee productivity could be harmed. Our employees may also face unexpected child-care or other related family responsibilities while working from home that could impact productivity and employee retention. In addition, work-from-home and related business practice modifications present significant challenges to maintaining our corporate culture, including employee engagement, productivity and retention, both during the immediate pandemic crisis and as we make additional adjustments in the eventual transition from it. Our remote work measures may not be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, and illness and workforce disruptions could lead to unavailability of key personnel and harm our ability to perform critical functions. Even in regions where governmental restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic are eased, we may continue to face challenges as our employees return to our offices, including managing our office environments in a manner that protects the health and safety of our employees and planning for a potential resurgence of COVID-19, which could negatively impact our business.\nOur future growth is substantially dependent on our direct sales team and partners driving new customer acquisition and expanded use of our platform within existing customers. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we held in-person sales, marketing, and industry events and our employees traveled frequently to establish and maintain relationships with our customers, prospective customers, and partners. Our business operations, including sales-related and customer support activities, could be increasingly adversely affected by continued or additional business closures, travel restrictions impacting employees and partners, virtualization of events, and other precautionary measures, especially in regions where we have material operations or sales. We may also experience negative impacts on our business if COVID-19 related governmental restrictions, or the easing or tightening of those restrictions, occurs at different rates in the markets in which we, our customers, or our partners operate, and as a result of the disparate restrictions we are unable to meet customer expectations. We may not be able to fully mitigate the impact of these disruptions which cannot be predicted or quantified at this time and which could negatively impact our business.\nThe pandemic and associated global economic uncertainty is also having an adverse impact on many of our customers, prospective customers and partners, which could result in reduced consumer demand and willingness to enter into or renew contracts with us, and ultimately could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. We have seen and may continue to see our customers and prospective customers deferring or delaying buying decisions and project implementations, prolonged sales cycles, and an increase in requests for extended payment terms due to uncertain economic conditions including those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the macroeconomic factors triggered by the pandemic have and could continue to result in decreased business spending by our customers and prospective customers, reduced demand for our solutions, longer sales cycles, lower renewal rates by our customers and increased competition, all of which could result in a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial condition even after the COVID-19 pandemic is contained and the shelter-in-place orders are lifted. If our customers are unable or unwilling to pay for their subscriptions to our platform, we may be adversely affected by an inability to collect amounts due, the cost of enforcing the terms of our contracts, including litigation, or a reduction in revenue. Further, if we experience a decrease in demand in a given period it could negatively affect our revenue in future\nperiods, particularly if experienced on a sustained basis, because a substantial proportion of revenue related to our platform is recognized over time. While we have developed and continue to develop plans to help mitigate the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, these efforts may not be effective and a protracted economic downturn may limit the effectiveness of our mitigation efforts.\nThe extent to which the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and associated global economic uncertainty, may impact our business will depend on future developments, including vaccine availability and distribution, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. The COVID-19 pandemic may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.\nWe have a limited history of operating at our current scale and under our current strategy, which makes it difficult to predict our future operating results, and we may not achieve our expected operating results in the future.\nWhile we were originally formed as Anaplan, LLC in 2008 and first introduced our business planning platform in 2011, much of our growth has occurred in recent years. Over the last few years, we have substantially increased our headcount, shifted our sales strategy to increase our focus on driving the adoption and expansion of our platform by our customers and increased our reliance on partners to accelerate our sales process and provide implementation services, and invested in enhancing the features of our platform. As we have a limited history of operations at our current scale and under our current strategy, our ability to forecast our future operating results and plan for and model future growth is more limited than that of companies with longer operating histories and subject to a number of uncertainties, including those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated economic disruptions and market volatility. In addition, we have encountered and will encounter risks, uncertainties and challenges frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing markets, such as the risks, uncertainties and challenges described this report. If our assumptions regarding these risks, uncertainties and challenges are incorrect or change, or if we do not execute on our strategy and manage these risks, uncertainties and challenges successfully, our operating results could differ materially from our expectations and those of securities analysts and investors, and our business could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nOur recent revenue growth rates may not be indicative of our future performance or growth.\nFrom fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2021, our total revenue grew from $348.0 million to $447.8 million, an increase of 29%, and from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2020, our total revenue grew from $240.6 million to $348.0 million, an increase of 45%. In future periods, we may not be able to sustain revenue growth consistent with recent history and/or that meets the expectations of securities analysts or investors. You should not consider our recent or historical revenue growth as indicative of our future performance or growth.\nWe have a history of net losses, we anticipate increasing our operating expenses in the future, and we do not expect to be profitable for the near future.\nWe have incurred significant losses in each period since inception, including net losses of $154.0 million, $149.2 million, and $131.0 million, respectively, in fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019. We had an accumulated deficit of $647.0 million at January 31, 2021. Our losses and accumulated deficit reflect the substantial investments we have made to acquire new customers and develop our platform. We expect our operating expenses to increase in the foreseeable future as we continue to make investments and implement initiatives designed to grow our business, including:\n\u2022\nexpanding our sales and marketing organization to increase our overall customer base, pursue larger transactions and expand sales within our current customer base;\n\u2022\nexpanding our offices and headcount internationally as we seek to continue to penetrate international markets, provided appropriate economic conditions and opportunities are present;\n\u2022\ninvesting in research and development to improve the capabilities, accessibility, features and functionality of our platform;\n\u2022\ngrowing our partner ecosystem;\n\u2022\nmaking additional investments to broaden and deepen our user community;\n\u2022\nexpanding our operations and infrastructure, both domestically and internationally, to support future growth; and\n\u2022\ninvesting in legal, accounting, human resources and other administrative functions necessary to support our operating as a public company.\nThese initiatives may prove more expensive than we currently anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenue, if at all, in an amount sufficient to offset these higher expenses and to achieve and sustain profitability. Growth of our revenue may slow or revenue may decline for a number of possible reasons, including a decrease in our ability to attract and retain customers, a failure to successfully implement our \u201cland and expand\u201d strategy, a failure to increase our number of partners, a decrease in the effectiveness of our partners, increasing competition, decreasing growth of our overall market, decreasing business spending by customers and prospective customers due to uncertain economic conditions including those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, an increase in legal risk from the use of our products due to evolving laws, regulations or standards, an inability to timely and cost-effectively introduce new products and services that are favorably received by customers and partners, a security incident, or our failure, for any reason, to continue to capitalize on growth opportunities. Further, we have entered into non-cancelable multi-year purchase commitments with respect to cloud partnership services with third-party public cloud partners, which require us to pay for such services irrespective of actual usage and may not be offset by increased revenue if we are unable to use these partnerships to attract new customers. To the extent we are successful in increasing our customer base, we will also initially incur increased losses because costs associated with acquiring customers are generally incurred up front. In contrast, subscription revenue is generally recognized ratably over the terms of the agreements that last typically two to three years, although some customers commit for shorter periods. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will achieve or maintain profitability in the future. Furthermore, any failure to achieve or maintain profitability, or the failure to do so on the timeline expected by investors or securities analysts, could adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nOur quarterly results may fluctuate significantly and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business.\nOur quarterly results of operations, our key metrics discussed elsewhere in this report, including the levels of our revenue, gross margin, cash flow, remaining performance obligations and deferred revenue, as well as other metrics that analysts use to evaluate our business such as billings and dollar-based net expansion rate, have fluctuated in the past and may vary significantly in the future. Quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results and other key metrics may not be meaningful. Accordingly, the results of any one quarter should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our quarterly financial results and metrics may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control and may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business. These fluctuations could result in our failure to meet our expectations or those of securities analysts or investors. If we fail to meet these expectations for any particular period, the trading price of our common stock could decline significantly. Factors that may cause these quarterly fluctuations include, without limitation, those listed below:\n\u2022\nthe impact of an economic downturn or market volatility, including the current downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, on the price of our common stock, our business and the businesses of our customers, prospective customers and partners;\n\u2022\nour ability to attract new customers;\n\u2022\nour customer renewal and adoption rates, and our ability to expand use of our platform by existing customers;\n\u2022\nthe timing and rate at which we sign agreements with customers, including the impact of cost reduction measures, delayed purchasing decisions or prolonged sales cycles at prospective or existing customers as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\nthe contract value of agreements with customers;\n\u2022\nthe addition or loss of large customers, including through acquisitions or consolidations;\n\u2022\nthe timing of recognition of revenue;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of operating expenses;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of completion of professional services engagements;\n\u2022\nour ability to hire, train and retain sales personnel, and their productivity rate including, any impact to productivity due to governmental restrictions adopted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\nchanges in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates and changes in the proportion of our revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies;\n\u2022\nseasonal variations in sales of our software subscriptions, which have historically been highest in the fourth quarter of a calendar year but may vary in future quarters;\n\u2022\nthe timing and success of new product features, updates, and enhancements by us or our competitors or any other change in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including consolidation among competitors, customers, or strategic partners;\n\u2022\nthe financial condition and creditworthiness of our customers, including greater unpredictability in our customers\u2019 willingness or ability to timely pay for subscriptions to our platform as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\nthe timing of expenses related to the development or possible acquisition and integration of technologies or businesses and potential future charges for impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets from acquired companies;\n\u2022\nour ability to achieve and sustain a level of liquidity sufficient to grow and support our business and operations;\n\u2022\nnetwork outages, technical difficulties or interruptions affecting the delivery and use of our platform or actual or perceived security breaches;\n\u2022\nany adverse litigation, judgments, settlements, or other litigation-related costs;\n\u2022\nchanges in the legislative or regulatory environment;\n\u2022\nnon-cancelable multi-year purchase commitments with third-party partners which require us to pay for services irrespective of actual usage;\n\u2022\nthe effects of global pandemics, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, industry, market and geopolitical conditions and uncertainty, both domestically and internationally.\nWe have experienced rapid growth and expect to continue to invest in our growth in the future. If we fail to manage our growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan, maintain high levels of service, or adequately address competitive challenges and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe have experienced a period of rapid growth in our headcount and operations in the United States and internationally. We have also significantly increased the size of our customer base and our partner ecosystem. We sell our platform to customers across the globe and have operations in North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific and Israel. We anticipate that we will continue to expand our domestic and international operations and headcount in the future, provided appropriate economic conditions and opportunities are present.\nThis growth has placed, and future growth will place, a significant strain on our management, and administrative, operational, and financial infrastructure. Our success will depend in part on our ability to manage this growth effectively and execute our business plan. To manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel, we must effectively recruit, motivate, integrate and retain employees in a manner consistent with, and that preserves, our corporate culture. We will also need to continue to develop our physical and remote work infrastructure to support our business growth, promote our\nworkers\u2019 safety, and enable our global workforce to effectively and securely communicate with each other, our partners and customers. As our customer base grows, we will need to maintain a high level of customer satisfaction by providing high quality customer support, consistency across deployments of our platform, and access to ongoing training. As we grow and our organizational structure becomes more complex, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial, reporting, compliance, information technology and management systems, controls and procedures, and our risk management activities related to the activities of our customers and partners. For the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, we will also need to monitor and respond to various and constantly changing local regulations, restrictions and requirements that could impact our operations, personnel and systems, controls and procedures.\nThese and other improvements in our operations, personnel and systems, controls and procedures will require significant capital expenditures and the allocation of valuable management and employee resources. Failure to effectively manage growth or execute our business plan could result in difficulty or delays in increasing the size of our customer base, declines in quality of customer support or customer satisfaction, increases in costs and expenses, failures to make timely and accurate reports of our operations and financial results, which would escalate the risk of noncompliance with applicable policies or laws, difficulties in introducing new features or other operational difficulties, harm to our reputation and brand. Any of these developments could adversely affect our business performance, results of operations and financial position.\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue from a single software platform and if our platform fails to satisfy customer demands or to achieve widespread market acceptance it would adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, and growth prospects.\nWe derive and expect to continue to derive substantially all of our revenue from our cloud-based enterprise planning software platform. As such, market acceptance of our platform is critical to our continued success. Demand for our platform is affected by a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include continued market acceptance of our platform for existing and new use cases, the introduction of enhancements to our platform that are well received by existing and prospective customers, the pace at which existing customers realize benefits from the use of our platform and its features and decide to expand deployment of our platform across their business, the extent to which our customers involve a wider group of employees in planning, the timing of development and release of new products by our competitors, technological change, the perception of ease of use, reliability and security of our platform, the pace at which enterprises engage in digital transformation initiatives, the success of our strategic partners, and developments in data privacy regulations. In addition, we expect that the planning and integration needs of our customers will continue to rapidly change and increase in complexity. We will need to improve the functionality, ease of use, and performance of our platform continually to meet those rapidly changing, complex demands. If we are unable to continue to meet customer demands or to achieve widespread market acceptance of our platform, our business operations, financial results, and growth prospects will be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to attract new customers, both domestically and internationally, the growth of our revenue will be adversely affected and our business may be harmed.\nOur ability to achieve significant growth in revenue and improvement in other key metrics in the future will depend, in large part, upon the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, both domestically and internationally, and our ability to attract new customers. This may be particularly challenging where an organization has already invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate traditional strategic planning and management solutions into its business, as such organization may be reluctant or unwilling to invest in new products and services. Furthermore, as our industry matures or if competitors introduce lower cost and/or differentiated products or services that are perceived to compete with ours, our ability to sell to new customers based on factors such as pricing, technology, and functionality could be impaired. Additionally, mitigation and containment measures adopted by government authorities to contain the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. and abroad, including travel restrictions and other requirements that limit in-person meetings, could limit our ability to establish relationships with new customers. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related global economic uncertainty, including decreased spending by prospective customers, delays in the implementation of digital transformation initiatives and prolonged sales cycles have disrupted the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, and the duration and scope of this disruption remains unclear. As a result, we may be unable to attract new customers at rates or on terms that would be favorable or comparable to prior periods, and our business, revenue, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur business depends substantially on our customers renewing their subscriptions and expanding their use of our platform. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions, if they renew on less favorable terms, or if they fail to add more users in more functional areas or upgrade to a higher level of functionality on our platform, our business and operating results will be adversely affected.\nIn order for us to maintain or improve our operating results, it is important that our customers renew their subscriptions when the contract term expires, add additional authorized users to their subscriptions, and upgrade to a higher level of functionality on the platform. Our customers generally enter into agreements with two- to three-year subscription terms and have no obligation to renew their subscriptions after the expiration of their initial subscription period. Our customers may decide not to renew their subscriptions with a similar contract period, at the same prices or terms or with the same or a greater number of authorized users or level of functionality as a result of a number of factors including uncertain economic conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of our customers have elected not to renew their agreements with us, and we may not be able to accurately predict renewal rates. Our customer retention may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including our customers\u2019 satisfaction with our platform and features, the quality of the professional services provided by us or our partners, our prices, the features and pricing of competing products, reductions in our customers\u2019 spending levels, customer adoption and expanded use of our platform, mergers and acquisitions involving our customers and deteriorating general economic conditions.\nIn addition, our growth strategy is a \u201cland-and-expand\u201d strategy that depends in substantial part on our customers expanding the use of our platform in their organizations through use by additional users, use across more functional areas of their organization, including finance, sales, supply chain, marketing, human resources, and operations, and the purchase of subscriptions providing additional features and functionality, such as the mobile app and predictive capabilities of our platform for sales and marketing. We refer to our \u201cland and expand\u201d strategy as the Honeycomb\u2122 effect where our platform\u2019s agility enables additional use cases across business functions. To increase the opportunities for further expanding the use of our platform by existing customers, we will need to introduce new features and functionality to our platform to more comprehensively address the needs of customers deploying our platform to address a wider variety of use cases and to support large, complex models. We will also need to drive user adoption rates of our platform. If our customers do not realize benefits through their initial adoption of our platform, or if they do not believe that they will realize additional benefits through broader deployment of our platform in other functional areas of their organizations, or in other uses cases, our ability to increase our revenue will suffer. Achieving incremental sales to our current customer base requires increasingly sophisticated and costly sales efforts that are targeted at senior management. If we are not able to attract the attention of our customers\u2019 senior management or to do so in a cost-effective manner, our sales efforts may not be effective and our ability to increase our revenue will suffer. We have seen and may continue to see prolonged sales cycles and other sales disruptions arising as a result of a number of factors including uncertain economic conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The duration and scope of these disruptions on our \u201cland and expand\u201d strategy remains unclear.\nIf our customers do not renew their subscriptions, if they renew on less favorable terms, or if they fail to add more users in more functional areas or upgrade to a higher level of functionality on our platform, our business and operating results as well as certain metrics that may be used to evaluate our business such as billings and dollar-based net expansion rate will be adversely affected.\nFailure to effectively expand our sales and marketing capabilities, including to hire and retain direct sales personnel, could harm our ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our service.\nOur ability to increase our customer base, achieve broader market acceptance of our platform, grow our revenue, and achieve and sustain profitability will depend, to a significant extent, on our ability to effectively expand our sales and marketing operations and activities, specifically our direct sales efforts targeted at executives of customers with the most complex planning needs. As we are substantially dependent on our direct sales force to obtain new customers and expand usage of our platform within existing customers, our ability to execute on our sales and marketing strategy will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training, incentivizing and retaining a sufficient number of qualified direct sales personnel and on such personnel attaining desired productivity levels within a reasonable amount of time. In recent years, we have increased the size of our direct sales force, and accordingly many of the new members of our sales force have not yet become fully productive. While remote work restrictions remain in place, newly hired direct sales personnel may need additional time to become fully productive\nas they may face additional hurdles due to remote onboarding and more limited access to customers. We plan to continue to expand our direct sales force both domestically and internationally but we may not be able to recruit and hire a sufficient number of sales personnel to successfully execute our hiring strategy, which may adversely affect our ability to expand our sales capabilities. New hires require significant training and time before they achieve full productivity, particularly in new sales territories. Our recent hires and planned hires may not become as productive as quickly as we would like, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the future in the markets where we do business. Furthermore, hiring sales personnel in new countries can be costly, complex, and time-consuming, and requires additional set up and upfront costs that may be disproportionate to the initial revenue that we expect to receive from those countries. We believe that there is significant competition for direct sales personnel with the sales skills and technical knowledge that we require. Attrition rates may increase, and we may face integration challenges as we continue to seek to expand our sales force. Moreover, we do not have significant experience as an organization developing and implementing overseas marketing campaigns, and such campaigns may be expensive and difficult to implement. Our business will be harmed if our continuing investment in increasing our sales and marketing capabilities does not generate a significant increase in revenue. Our sales and marketing expenses represent a significant percentage of our expenses, and our operating results will suffer if our sales and marketing expenditures do not contribute to increasing revenue as we anticipate.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way we interact with our customers and prospective customers. We have, and may continue to, alter, postpone or cancel planned customer, employee and industry events or shift them to a virtual only format. Our operating results may also suffer if sales and marketing personnel are unable to maintain the same level of productivity while working remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic. These and other changes in the ways in which we interact with and market to our customers and prospective customers could adversely impact our business if they prove to be less effective than in-person events.\nOur growth depends in part on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties and their continued performance.\nWe have established strategic relationships with global strategic consulting firms, global systems integrators, regional consulting firms, implementation partners, public cloud partners and technology partners. We intend for these parties, as members of our partner ecosystem, to contribute to our growth by, among other things, extending the coverage and enhancing the expertise of our professional services, expanding the reach of our platform, and accelerating the usage and adoption of our platform. Partners can also exercise a significant role in revenue generation, by referring opportunities to us, enhancing the effectiveness of our sales efforts by establishing connections with senior management at prospective customers and/or promoting the use of our platform as a key component of digital transformation projects that the partner is implementing with their own customers. In order to grow our business, we anticipate that we will need to broaden and deepen our partner ecosystem by continuing to establish and maintain relationships with such third parties. Identifying partners, and negotiating and documenting relationships with them, requires significant time and resources. If we are not able to successfully operationalize our partnerships, we may not be able to generate growth sufficient to meet our contractual commitments, which could adversely affect our revenue, gross margin, profitability, financial position, and cash flow. Our partners may conclude that they are not receiving sufficient benefits, economic or otherwise, from their relationships with us, resulting in a reduction or termination of their involvement in our partner ecosystem. Our partners may have relationships with our competitors or experience with their products or services and such relationships or experience may result in our partners recommending our competitors\u2019 products or services over ours. Furthermore, our competitors may be effective in providing incentives to our partners to favor their products or services or to prevent or reduce subscriptions to our services. In addition, acquisitions of our partners by our competitors could result in a decrease in the number of our current and potential customers, as our partners may no longer facilitate the adoption of our platform by potential customers. Uncertain economic conditions, including those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, have and may continue to have an adverse impact on the business operations of our existing partners and on our ability to attract and retain new partners, which could result in reduced demand generation and ultimately could disrupt our business operations with a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nIf we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with third parties, or our partners fail to perform or are unable to perform (including due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic), our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenue could be impaired, we could incur increased operating expenses and our operating results may suffer. Even if we are successful, we cannot assure you that these relationships will result in increased customer adoption or usage of our platform or increased revenue.\nIf our customers and partners do not have access to highly skilled and trained users of our platform, our customers may not be able to unlock the full potential of our platform, customer satisfaction may suffer, and our results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects may be adversely affected.\nIn order for our customers to unlock the full potential of our platform, both our customers and partners need access to highly skilled and trained users of our platform, such as Master Anaplanners. Implementations of our platform may be technically complicated because our platform is designed to be deployed in a wide range of technological environments and integrates data from a broad and complex range of workflows and systems. In order for our customers to successfully implement our platform, they need access to highly skilled users that are familiar with their operating environment and with our platform. Further, our partners rely heavily on highly skilled and trained users of our platform to effectively provide implementation, training and consulting services to our customers. Incorrect or improper implementation or use of our platform could result in customer dissatisfaction and harm our business and financial condition. If our customers are unable to implement our platform, perceptions of our company and our platform may be impaired, our reputation and brand may suffer, and customers may choose not to renew their subscriptions or increase their purchases of our related services. Our \u201cland and expand\u201d growth strategy depends in large part on existing customers adding new users and use cases, and expanding to additional lines of business, divisions, and geographies. We have found that this strategy is most successful when internal users quickly adopt our platform and build out their expertise as informed end users of our platform. Our partners\u2019 trained users also develop new solutions on our platform and promote and facilitate adoption of our platform at our customers. If our customers and partners do not have access to highly skilled and trained users of our platform, implementation and adoption of our\nplatform may not be effective, customer satisfaction may suffer, and our results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects may be adversely affected.\nWe need to continue to develop a steady pipeline of highly qualified and trained personnel to meet customer and partner demand, but our efforts may be ineffective. While we continue to expand our training resources for trained users of our platform, we increasingly rely on our customers and partners to encourage their users to enhance their Anaplan expertise using our training resources. If our customers and partner do not encourage enough internal users to become highly skilled users of our platform, there may not be enough trained users of our platform to meet demand. If a customer has not developed an internal cohort of trained users of our platform, the loss of a trained user could have an adverse impact on their ability to unlock the value of our platform and ability to expand the platform\u2019s use within the organization. Further, the courses we offer on the Anaplan Academy, Anaplan\u2019s online training portal providing a full range of training courses on our platform, may not serve their intended purpose or the certification programs we offer may take longer than anticipated to create a robust and consistent pipeline of talent. Our customers and partners need regular training to support disparate technologies involved in large-scale deployments and maximize potential of our platform as technology changes without which our results of operations and growth prospects could be materially adversely affected. Our ability to effectively educate and train users of our platform may be negatively impacted if our customer support employees or the users of our customers or partners are unable to receive training virtually while COVID-19 restrictions remain in place or the virtual training is not as effective as in-person training methods. If we fail to develop and maintain a sufficient pipeline of qualified and trained users of our platform for utilization with our customers and partners, we may suffer adverse consequences including professional services not being furnished correctly, incorrect or improper use of our platform by partners and customers, damage to our reputation and brand, and customers choosing not to renew their subscriptions or expand their use of our platform. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and growth prospects.\nIf customers are not satisfied with the implementation services provided by us or our partners, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur business depends on the professional services that are performed to help our customers implement and use our platform. Professional services may be performed by our own staff, by a third-party partner or by a combination of the two. Our strategy is to work with partners to increase the breadth of capability and depth of capacity for delivery of these services to our customers, and we expect the number of our partner-led implementations to continue to increase over time. Our ability and the ability of our third-party partners to successfully implement services may be negatively impacted by remote work environments and travel restrictions adopted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to the travel restrictions and other measures enacted in connection with COVID-19, professional services, including implementation projects that were previously performed at a customer location are now provided virtually. However, virtual provision of services may not be as effective or deliver the same benefits as services performed on-site. If a customer is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a partner or with the type of professional services or functionality delivered, even if we are not contractually responsible for the partner services, then we could incur additional costs to address the situation, the profitability of that work might be impaired and the customer\u2019s dissatisfaction with our or our partner\u2019s services could damage our ability to expand the scope of functionality subscribed to by that customer. In addition, negative publicity related to our customer relationships, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective customers.\nIf we fail to continue to enhance our platform, satisfy the cloud infrastructure priorities of our clients or adapt to rapid technological change, our ability to remain competitive could be impaired.\nThe industry in which we compete is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent introductions of new products, and evolving industry standards. Our ability to attract new customers and increase revenue from existing customers will depend on a number of factors including: our ability to anticipate industry standards and trends, to continue to enhance our platform and introduce new functionality in a timely manner, to update and expand our infrastructure, and to keep pace with technological developments. The success of any enhancement, new functionality, or infrastructure development depends on several factors, including timely completion and market acceptance. Any new enhancement, functionality, or infrastructure development might not be introduced in a timely or cost-effective manner and might not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenue. If any of our competitors implements new technologies before we are able to implement them or if our competitors are able to respond more quickly and effectively to new or changing opportunities, those competitors may be able to provide more effective products than ours at lower prices.\nWe have experienced, and may in the future experience, delays in the planned release dates of enhancements to our platform. Delays could result in adverse publicity, loss of sales, delay in market acceptance of our platform, any of which could cause us to lose existing customers or impair our ability to attract new customers. In addition, the introduction of new products and services by competitors or the development of entirely new technologies to replace existing offerings could make our platform obsolete or adversely affect our ability to compete. Any delay or failure in the introduction of enhancements, functionality, or infrastructure developments could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur platform must also integrate with a variety of third-party technologies, and we need to continuously modify and enhance our platform to adapt to changes in cloud-enabled hardware, software, networking, browser, and database technologies. Any undetected errors or defects in this third-party software, or cybersecurity threats or attacks related to such software, could impair the functionality of our platform, result in increased costs, and injure our reputation. Any failure of our platform to operate effectively with existing or future technologies, or any failure of a third-party cloud infrastructure partner to support one or more of the features of our platform, could cause customer dissatisfaction and reduce the demand for our platform, resulting in harm to our business. Further, the emergence of new industry standards related to strategic planning and operational execution products and services may adversely affect the demand for our platform. In addition, because our platform is cloud-based, we need to continually enhance and improve our platform to keep pace with changes in Internet-related hardware, software, communications, and database technologies and standards. Any failure of our platform to operate effectively with future hardware or software technologies, or to comply with new industry standards, could reduce the demand for our platform and harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe invest significantly in research and development, and to the extent our research and development investments are not directed efficiently or do not result in material enhancements to our platform, our business and results of operations would be harmed.\nA key element of our strategy is to invest significantly in our research and development efforts to enhance the features, functionality, performance, and ease of use of our platform to address additional applications and use cases that will broaden the appeal of our platform and facilitate the broad use of our platform across customers with complex planning needs. If we do not spend our research and development budget efficiently or effectively on compelling enhancements, innovations and technologies, such as public cloud functionality, predictive analytics and machine learning, our business may be harmed and we may not realize the expected benefits of our strategy. We will need to appropriately deploy our human resources, and may need to hire new employees with highly technical skills who are often in high demand, or we may not be able to effectively execute on our research and development strategy. Our ability to conduct research and development activities as planned may also be negatively impacted by our remote work environment adopted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, research and development projects can be technically challenging and expensive. As a result of the nature of research and development cycles, there will be delays between the time we incur expenses associated with research and development activities and the time we are able to offer compelling enhancements to our platform and generate revenue, if any, from those activities. Additionally, anticipated customer demand for a platform enhancement we are developing could decrease after the development\ncycle has commenced. If we expend a significant amount of resources on research and development efforts that do not lead to the successful introduction of functionality or platform improvements that are competitive in our current or future markets our business and results of operations will suffer.\nIf we experience a security incident affecting our platform, networks, systems or data or the data of our customers, or are perceived to have experienced such a security incident, our platform may be perceived as not being secure, our reputation may be harmed, customers may reduce the use of or stop using our platform, we may incur significant liabilities, and our business could be materially adversely affected.\nOur platform involves the storage, transmission and processing of our customers\u2019 sensitive proprietary information, including their business and financial data. We also use third-party service providers to deliver services to our customers and employees, and those providers may store or process the personal or confidential information of our customers or employees. Security incidents have become more prevalent across industries and our platform, systems, networks or the systems or networks of our third-party service providers may become the subject of such an incident. These security incidents may be caused by the intentional acts of third-party actors, or may arise from failures or defects in our or our partners\u2019 software, systems or controls.\nWhile we have many security measures in place designed to protect customer and other sensitive information and the integrity of our information technology systems and prevent data loss and other security breaches, our security measures or those of our third party service providers may not be sufficiently broad in scope to protect all relevant information, may be deployed incorrectly, may not be adequately monitored or supported due to insufficient personnel or resources, may not function as planned, or could be breached as a result of third-party action, human error, technical malfunction, malfeasance, or otherwise. As we do not control our third-party service providers, or have real-time visibility of their security measures, we cannot ensure the integrity or sufficiency of their security measures and hackers or other third parties may successfully breach our systems by exploiting a vulnerability in third-party software or applications that are utilized by, or have access to, our systems. Third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce our employees, contractors, or users into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information or otherwise compromise the security of our platform, systems or networks in order to breach our security measures and gain unauthorized access to our data or our customers\u2019 data. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, become more complex over time or may be designed to remain dormant until a predetermined event and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement sufficient preventative measures to defend against these techniques. Further, once a security incident is identified, we may be unable to remediate or otherwise respond to such incident in a timely manner. Our users may also disclose or lose control of their passwords, or use the same or similar passwords on third parties\u2019 systems, which could lead to unauthorized access to their accounts on our platform. Further, we may face additional cybersecurity risks related to our employees and partners working remotely during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and potentially beyond as remote work becomes more commonplace.\nA security incident may result in unauthorized access, use, loss, modification or disclosure of our or our customers\u2019 sensitive information, or denial or degradation of service, which could seriously harm our or our customers\u2019 businesses and reputations. Any security incidents, whether real or perceived, could result in the expenditure of significant resources to analyze, correct, eliminate, or remediate errors or vulnerabilities, negatively affect our ability to attract new customers or partners, cause existing partners to end their relationship with us and existing customers to reduce the use of our platform or elect to not renew their subscriptions, expose us to reputational damage, subject us to contractual liability, third-party lawsuits, regulatory inquiries or fines, or other action or liability, which could adversely affect our operating results. We cannot assure you that any limitations of liability provisions in our contracts for a security breach or incident would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim. While we maintain insurance, our insurance coverage related to security and privacy damages may not be adequate for liabilities actually incurred and we cannot be certain that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage of a future claim. These risks are likely to increase as our brand becomes more widely known and recognized, governments enact increasingly strict regulations regarding data security and privacy, we continue to grow the scale and functionality of our platform and\nprocess, store, and transmit increasingly large amounts of our customers\u2019 information and data, which may include proprietary or confidential data or personal or identifying information.\nWe may also experience disruptions, outages, and other performance problems on our systems due to service attacks, unauthorized access, or other security-related incidents. For example, third parties may conduct attacks designed to temporarily deny customers access to our services. Any successful denial of service attack could result in a loss of customer confidence in the security of our platform and damage to our brand.\nReal or perceived errors, failures, bugs, service outages, or disruptions in our platform could adversely affect our reputation and harm our business.\nOur platform is complex, has contained defects and errors and may continue to contain undetected defects or errors. We are continuing to evolve the features and functionality of our platform through updates and enhancements, and as we do so, we may introduce additional defects or errors that may not be detected until after deployment by our customers. In addition, if our platform is not implemented or used correctly or as intended, inadequate performance and disruptions in service may result. Our platform is often used in connection with large scale computing environments which may expose errors, failures, or vulnerabilities in our platform or integrations. Moreover, we have acquired and may in the future acquire companies or integrate into our platform technologies developed by third parties and we may encounter difficulty in incorporating the newly-obtained technologies into our platform or maintaining the quality standards that are consistent with our reputation, and furthermore, we may face technological incompatibilities with the newly-acquired intellectual property. In addition, while we seek to maintain sufficient excess capacity in our operations infrastructure to meet the needs of all of our customers, we have experienced, and may in the future experience, disruptions, outages, and other performance problems.\nSince our customers use our platform for important aspects of their business, any actual or perceived errors, defects, disruptions in service, outages, or other performance problems could damage our customers\u2019 businesses. Any defects or errors in our platform and solutions, or the perception of such defects or errors, or other performance problems could result in any of the following, each of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations:\n\u2022\nexpenditure of significant financial and product development resources in efforts to analyze, correct, eliminate or work around errors or defects;\n\u2022\nloss of existing or potential customers or partners;\n\u2022\ninterruptions or delays in sales of our platform;\n\u2022\ndelayed or lost revenue;\n\u2022\ndelay or failure to attain market acceptance;\n\u2022\ndelay in the development or release of new functionality or improvements to our platform;\n\u2022\nnegative publicity, which could harm our reputation;\n\u2022\nsales credits or refunds for prepaid amounts related to unused subscription services;\n\u2022\ndiversion of development and customer service resources;\n\u2022\nbreach of warranty claims against us, which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts; and\n\u2022\nan increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable or the expense and risk of litigation.\nAlthough we have contractual protections, such as warranty disclaimers and limitation of liability provisions, in our standard terms and conditions of sale, they may not fully or effectively protect us from claims by customers, partners or other third parties. Any insurance coverage we may have may not adequately cover all claims asserted against us, or cover only a portion of such claims. A successful product liability, warranty, or other similar claim against us could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. In addition, even claims that ultimately are unsuccessful could result in our expenditure of funds in litigation and divert management\u2019s time and other resources.\nWe depend on computing infrastructure operated by third parties, and any delays in service or disruption in these operations or an inability to increase capacity could impair the use or functionality of our platform, harm our business, and subject us to liability.\nWe currently serve our customers from third-party data center facilities operated by Equinix, Inc. located in the United States, the Netherlands, and Germany. We are also developing our platform on the infrastructure of certain third-party public cloud partners in order to increase the accessibility and reach of our platform. If we are unable to renew our cloud infrastructure agreements on commercially reasonable terms, we may be required to transfer our servers and other infrastructure, and we may incur significant costs and experience possible service interruptions in connection with doing so.\nAlthough we have disaster recovery plans in place, we may experience interruptions, delays and outages in service and availability from time-to-time arising from problems with our third-party data center or cloud partner infrastructure including technical failures, power loss or telecommunications failures or capacity issues, natural disasters, security incidents, and other events beyond our control which could negatively affect the use, functionality or availability of our platform and harm our reputation, damage our customers\u2019 businesses, and adversely affect our business. In addition, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may have an adverse operational impact on our data center and public cloud infrastructure partners, as they navigate restrictions, health and safety regulations and other impacts from the pandemic. Furthermore, in the event of interruption or delay in service, our insurance coverage may not adequately compensate us for any losses that we may incur.\nIn addition, as we continue to increase the number of customers and users on our platform, we will need to increase the capacity of our cloud infrastructure, including internationally. If we do not increase our capacity in a timely manner, customers could experience interruptions or delays in access to our platform, and we may not be able to attract potential customers in specific regions of the world unless we provide localized offerings in those regions. As we continue to increase our cloud capacity, we may move or transfer our data and our customers\u2019 data. Despite precautions taken during this process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair the use or functionality of our platform. Any damage to, or failure of, our systems, or those of our third-party data center or public cloud infrastructure partners, could interrupt our service and hinder the use or functionality of our platform. Impairment of or interruptions in our service may reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay penalties, subject us to claims and litigation, cause our customers to terminate their subscriptions, and adversely affect our renewal rates and our ability to attract new customers. Our business will also be harmed if our customers and potential customers believe our platform is unreliable.\nAny failure to offer high-quality technical support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results.\nOnce our platform is implemented, our customers depend on our support organization to resolve technical issues or perceived technical issues relating to the platform. We may be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for support services. We also may be unable to modify the format of our support services to compete with changes in support services provided by our competitors. Our ability to provide support services may also be negatively impacted by our remote work environment adopted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Increased customer demand for these services, without corresponding revenue, could increase costs and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, our sales process is highly dependent on our business reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing customers. Any failure to maintain high-quality technical support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could adversely affect our reputation, our ability to sell subscriptions to our platform to existing and prospective customers and our business, operating results, and financial position.\nIf we fail to develop, maintain, and enhance widespread brand awareness in a cost-effective manner or if we receive negative publicity, our revenue and competitive position may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe believe that developing, maintaining, and enhancing widespread awareness of our brand and our platform solutions that enable Connected Planning and digital transformation in a cost-effective manner is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our platform, attracting new customers, and maintaining existing customers. For example, widespread awareness of our brand is critical to ensuring that we are invited to participate in requests for proposals from prospective customers. We have made, and will continue to make, significant investments to promote our brand. However, brand promotion activities may not generate customer awareness or increase revenue, and, even if they do, any increase in revenue may not offset the expenses we incur in building our brand. Furthermore, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has made it more challenging to develop, maintain and enhance widespread awareness of our brand. Numerous marketing and brand promotion events, held in-person with customers and prospective customers in prior years, have been delayed, cancelled or converted into a virtual format. Virtual events may not be as successful as in-person interactions, and the precautions and safety measures that have been adopted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly if extended for prolonged periods, could have a detrimental effect on our ability to develop, maintain and enhance widespread awareness of our brand. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand, or incur\nsubstantial expenses, we may fail to attract or retain customers necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts or to achieve the widespread brand awareness that is critical for broad customer adoption of our platform. We believe that the importance of our brand and reputation will increase as competition in our market further intensifies.\nNegative publicity, whether or not justified, relating to our company, our platform, or events or activities attributed to us, our employees, our partners or others associated with any of these parties, may tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand. Independent industry analysts often provide reviews of our platform, as well as the products and services of our competitors, and perception of our platform in the marketplace may be significantly influenced by these reviews. If these reviews are negative, or less positive as compared to those of our competitors\u2019 products and services, our brand may be adversely affected. Additionally, the performance of our partners may affect our brand and reputation if customers do not have a positive experience with our partners\u2019 services. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity may reduce demand for our platform and have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Moreover, any attempts to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brands may be costly and time consuming, and such efforts may not ultimately be successful. The upfront investment and costs incurred to build and maintain our brand, both domestically and internationally, may not generate increased market acceptance and may negatively impact our results of operations.\nBecause our platform is sold to enterprises with complex operating environments, we can encounter long and unpredictable sales cycles, which could adversely affect our operating results in a given period.\nOur ability to increase revenue and achieve profitability depends, in large part, on widespread adoption of our platform by customers with complex operating environments who tend to make larger purchases of our products. As we target our sales efforts at these customers, we face greater costs, longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing some of our sales. Further, we have experienced and we expect to experience prolonged sales cycles as a result of uncertain economic conditions including those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the variability and length of the sales cycle, we have only a limited ability to forecast the timing of sales. A delay in or failure to complete large sales to one or more enterprise customers could harm our business and financial results, and could cause our financial results to vary significantly from period to period. Our sales cycle varies widely, reflecting differences in potential customers\u2019 decision-making processes, procurement requirements, and budget cycles, and is subject to significant risks over which we have little or no control, including:\n\u2022\ncustomers\u2019 budgetary constraints and priorities;\n\u2022\nthe timing of customers\u2019 budget cycles;\n\u2022\nthe need by some customers for lengthy evaluations;\n\u2022\nannouncements of new products, features, or functionality by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nexternal factors such as economic uncertainty (including due to the COVID-19 pandemic); and\n\u2022\nthe length and timing of customers\u2019 approval processes and disruptions to their approval process arising from disruptions in operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nA customer\u2019s decision to use our platform may be an enterprise-wide decision, requiring us to expend substantial time, effort, and money educating customers as to the use and value of our platform and encouraging widespread adoption of our platform by users. In addition, our ability to successfully sell our platform to customers with complex planning needs is dependent on us attracting and retaining sales personnel with experience in selling to these customers. Moreover, our target customers may prefer to purchase software that is critical to their business from one of our larger, more established competitors. Our typical sales cycles can range from three to nine months, and we expect that this lengthy sales cycle may continue or lengthen further. Longer sales cycles could cause our operating and financial results to suffer in a given period.\nBecause we recognize revenue over varying periods depending on the nature of the revenue, changes in our business including downturns or upturns in new sales and renewals will not be immediately reflected in our operating results and may be difficult to discern.\nWe generally recognize subscription revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their contracts, which are typically two to three years, although some customers commit for shorter periods. As a result, most of the subscription revenue we report in each quarter is derived from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to subscriptions entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any single quarter will likely have only a small impact on our revenue for that quarter. However, such a decline will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. In addition, the severity and duration of events that affect revenue may not be predictable and their effects could extend beyond a single quarter. Accordingly, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, significant downturns in sales and market acceptance of our platform, and potential changes in our pricing policies or rate of renewals, may not be fully apparent from our reported results of operations until future periods.\nIn addition, a majority of our costs are expensed as incurred, while subscription revenue is recognized over the life of the customer agreement. As a result, increased growth in the number of our customers could continue to result in our recognition of more costs than revenue in the earlier periods of the terms of our agreements with them. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term.\nIn addition, professional services revenue is recognized as the services are performed or upon the completion of the project, depending on the type of professional services arrangement involved. Professional services engagements typically span from a few weeks to several months, which can make it difficult to predict the timing of revenue recognition for such services and the corresponding effects on our results of operations. Professional services revenue has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly from period to period, as we are increasingly leveraging our partners to provide these services. In addition, because professional services expenses are recognized as the services are performed, professional services margins can significantly fluctuate from period to period.\nThe sum of our revenue and changes in deferred revenue may not be an accurate indicator of business activity within a period.\nInvestors or analysts sometimes look to the sum of revenue and changes in deferred revenue, sometimes referred to as \u201cestimated billings,\u201d as an indicator of business activity in a period for businesses such as ours. However, these measures may significantly differ from underlying business activity for a number of reasons including:\n\u2022\na relatively large number of transactions occur at the end of the quarter. Invoicing of those transactions may or may not occur before the end of the quarter based on a number of factors including receipt of information from the customer, volume of transactions, and holidays. A shift of a few days has little economic impact on our business, but will shift deferred revenue from one period into the next;\n\u2022\nmulti-year upfront billings may distort trends;\n\u2022\nsubscriptions that have deferred start dates; and\n\u2022\nservices that are invoiced upon delivery.\nAccordingly, we do not believe that estimated billings are an accurate indicator of future revenue for any given period of time. However, many companies that provide subscriptions report changes in estimated billings as a key operating or financial metric, and it is possible that analysts or investors may view this metric as important. Thus, any changes in our estimated billings could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nChanges in our subscription or pricing models could adversely affect our operating results.\nAs the markets for our software subscriptions grow, as new competitors introduce new products or services that compete with ours or as we enter into new international markets, we may be unable to attract new customers at the same price or based on the same pricing model as we have historically used. Regardless of pricing model used, large customers may demand higher price discounts than in the past. As a result, we may be required to reduce our prices, offer shorter contract durations or offer alternative pricing models, which could adversely affect our revenue, gross margin, profitability, financial position, and cash flow.\nIn the past, we have been able to increase our prices for our platform and services, but we may choose not to introduce or be unsuccessful in implementing future price increases. Our competitors may introduce new products that compete with ours or reduce their prices, or we may be unable to attract new customers or retain existing customers based on our historical pricing models. As we expand internationally, we also must determine the appropriate pricing to enable us to compete effectively internationally. In addition, if our mix of products sold changes, then we may need to, or choose to, revise our pricing. As a result, we may be required or choose to reduce our prices or change our pricing model, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend on the experience and expertise of our senior management team and certain key employees, especially engineering, research and development and sales personnel, and our inability to retain these executive officers and key employees or recruit them in a timely manner, could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur success depends largely upon the continued services of our key executive officers and certain key employees. We rely on our executive leadership team in the areas of business strategy, research and development, marketing, sales, services, and general and administrative functions. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, changes in our executive management team or key employees resulting from the hiring or departure of executives or key employees, which could disrupt our business. We do not have employment agreements with our executive officers or other key personnel that require them to continue to work for us for any specified period and, therefore, they could terminate their employment with us at any time. Conversely, we may terminate the employment of the senior management team and certain key employees, which may subject us to costly and time-consuming negotiations over severance, litigation and employment claims. While we seek to carefully manage any changes in our executive management team or key employees, including by establishing processes and procedures and engaging in succession planning, such measures may be insufficient and the departure or unavailability of one or more of our executive officers or key employees could have a serious adverse effect on our business.\nTo execute our growth plan, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel, especially engineering, research and development and sales personnel. Competition for personnel can be intense, especially for engineers with high levels of experience in designing and developing software for Internet-related services and for direct sales personnel with the sales skills and technical knowledge that we require. For example, competition is intense for experienced software and cloud infrastructure engineers in San Francisco in the United States, London and York in the U.K., and Israel, our primary development locations. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be adversely affected.\nMany of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. If we hire employees from competitors or other companies, their former employers may attempt to assert that these employees or our company have breached their legal obligations, resulting in a diversion of our time and resources and potential litigation. In addition, job candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the stock awards they receive in connection with their employment. If the perceived value of our stock awards declines, it may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled employees. Further, in times of increased economic uncertainty, employees and potential employees may perceive older or larger companies to be more attractive and the current period of economic uncertainty may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled employees. The challenges we face in recruiting and hiring qualified personnel may be compounded by a decreased willingness of candidates to leave their current employment due to various factors including economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and uncertainty regarding immigration policies.\nOur global operations and sales to customers outside the United States or with international operations subject us to risks inherent in international operations that can harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nA key element of our strategy is to operate globally and sell our products to customers across the world. We derive a significant portion of our revenue from customers located outside the United States. Operating globally requires significant resources and management attention. We cannot be certain that the investment and additional resources required to operate globally will produce desired levels of revenue or profitability. Further, operating globally subjects us to various risks, including:\n\u2022\nincreased management, travel, infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with having operations in many countries;\n\u2022\nincreased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n\u2022\nvariations in adoption and acceptance of cloud computing in different countries, requirements or preferences for domestic products, and difficulties in replacing products offered by more established or known regional competitors;\n\u2022\nnew and different sources of competition;\n\u2022\nlaws and business practices favoring local competitors;\n\u2022\ndiffering technical standards, existing or future regulatory and certification requirements and required features and functionality;\n\u2022\ncommunication and integration problems related to entering and serving new markets with different languages, cultures, and political systems;\n\u2022\ncompliance with foreign privacy and security laws and regulations, including data privacy laws that require customer data to be stored and processed in a designated territory, and the risks and costs of non-compliance;\n\u2022\ncompliance with laws and regulations for foreign operations, including anti-bribery laws (such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.S. Travel Act, and the U.K. Bribery Act), import and export control laws, tax laws, tariffs, trade barriers, economic sanctions, and other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to sell our products in certain foreign markets, and the risks and costs of non-compliance;\n\u2022\ncompliance with foreign laws, regulations and orders related to health and safety, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\nheightened risks of unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies that may impact our financial results and result in restatements of our consolidated financial statements;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates and related effects on our results of operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in repatriating or transferring funds from or converting currencies in certain countries;\n\u2022\ndifferent pricing environments, longer sales cycles, and longer accounts receivable payment cycles and collections issues;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic conditions and uncertainty in the countries or regions in which we operate and around the world;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in recruiting, managing and retaining local partners, including consulting and implementation firms, to support our operations and sales;\n\u2022\ndiffering labor standards, including restrictions related to, and the increased cost of, terminating employees in some countries;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in recruiting, hiring and retaining employees in certain countries;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing a global workforce and maintaining our corporate culture globally;\n\u2022\nthe preference for localized software and licensing programs;\n\u2022\nthe preference for localized language support;\n\u2022\nweaker protection in some jurisdictions for intellectual property and other legal rights than in the United States and practical difficulties in enforcing intellectual property and other rights outside of the United States;\n\u2022\ncompliance with the laws of numerous foreign taxing jurisdictions, including withholding obligations, and overlapping of different tax regimes;\n\u2022\ncompliance challenges related to the complexity of multiple, conflicting and changing governmental laws and regulations, including employment, tax, privacy, and data protection laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nthe fragmentation of longstanding regulatory frameworks caused by Brexit; and\n\u2022\nglobal pandemics such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and travel restrictions and other measures undertaken by governments in response to such pandemics.\nAny of the above risks could adversely affect our international operations, reduce our revenue from customers outside of the United States or increase our operating costs, each of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and growth prospects.\nSome of our business partners also have international operations and are subject to the risks described above. Even if we are able to successfully manage the risks of international operations, our business may be adversely affected if our business partners are not able to successfully manage these risks.\nOur corporate culture promotes an entrepreneurial mindset, and if we cannot maintain this culture as we grow, we could lose the entrepreneurial spirit, innovation, creativity, and other qualities we believe contribute to our success, and it could harm our business.\nWe believe that our culture has been, and will continue to be, a key contributor to our success because it fosters the entrepreneurial spirit, innovation, creativity, and other qualities we believe drive our growth. As we continue to grow, we will need to maintain our corporate culture among a larger number of employees dispersed in various geographic regions. However, our growth may result in a change to, or dilution of, our corporate culture, and we may not be able to effectively integrate new hires in our fast-paced culture. The challenge we face in maintaining our culture is compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects including an employee base that is working remotely and facing personal and professional challenges. Any failure to maintain the cohesiveness of our culture could negatively affect\nour business, decrease employee engagement and productivity, result in current or former employees posting negative feedback on third-party company review sites, damage our reputation, reduce our ability to retain and recruit personnel and could lead to the failure to achieve our vision and implement our strategy.\nWe may engage in strategic transactions, which could divert our management\u2019s attention, result in additional dilution to our stockholders, disrupt our operations and adversely affect our operating results. We may not be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies or achieve the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions.\nIn pursuing our business strategy, we have in the past acquired and may in the future seek to acquire or invest in businesses, products, technologies, or talent that we believe could complement or expand our platform, augment our product offerings, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. We often compete with others for the same opportunities. The pursuit of any of these strategic transactions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses in identifying, investigating, and pursuing suitable transactions, whether or not they are consummated.\nAny strategic transaction may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. If we acquire additional businesses or enter into other strategic transactions, we may not be able to integrate the acquired personnel, operations, and technologies successfully, or effectively manage the combined business following the strategic transactions. In addition, we have limited experience in consummating strategic transactions. We also may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the strategic transactions due to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nfailure to evaluate, integrate, utilize or benefit from or accurately anticipate the adoption rates of acquired technologies or services;\n\u2022\nproduct synergies, cost reductions, increases in revenue and economies of scale may not materialize as expected;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in retaining, motivating and integrating key management and other employees of the acquired business;\n\u2022\nthe business culture of the acquired entity may not match well with our culture;\n\u2022\nunforeseen delays, unanticipated costs and liabilities may arise when integrating operations, processes and systems in geographies where we have not conducted business;\n\u2022\nunanticipated costs or liabilities associated with the strategic transactions;\n\u2022\nincurrence of transaction-related costs;\n\u2022\nassumption of the existing obligations or unforeseen liabilities of the acquired business that we were not able to mitigate through due diligence or other means;\n\u2022\ndifficulty integrating the accounting systems, security infrastructure, operations, and personnel of the acquired business;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and additional expenses associated with supporting legacy products and hosting infrastructure of the acquired business;\n\u2022\ndifficulty converting the current and prospective customers of the acquired business onto our platform and contract terms, including disparities in the revenue, licensing, support, or professional services model of the acquired company;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022\nadverse effects to our existing business relationships with business partners and customers as a result of the strategic transactions;\n\u2022\nunexpected costs may arise due to unforeseen changes in tax, payroll, pension, labor, trade, environmental and safety policies in new jurisdictions where the acquired entity operates;\n\u2022\nuse of resources that are needed in other parts of our business; and\n\u2022\nuse of substantial portions of our available cash to consummate the strategic transaction.\nIn addition, a significant portion of the purchase price of companies we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill and other intangible assets, which must be assessed for impairment at least annually. In the future, if our acquisitions do not yield expected returns, we may be required to take charges to our operating results based on this impairment assessment process, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nStrategic transactions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our operating results, increase our financial risk, and cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In addition, if a strategic transaction fails to meet our expectations, our operating results, business, and financial position may suffer.\nIndustry Risks\nThe markets in which we participate are intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe market for business planning software is highly competitive, with relatively low barriers to entry for some software or services. As a result, we anticipate aggressive competition not only from established vendors of business planning software but also from new entrants into the industry. Our ability to compete successfully in our market depends on a number of factors, both within and outside of our control. Any failure by us to compete successfully in any one of these or other areas may reduce the demand for our platform, as well as adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur competitors primarily include Oracle Corporation (Oracle), SAP AG (SAP), Workday, Inc. (Workday) and International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), which are well-established providers of business planning and analytics software with long-standing relationships with many customers. Some customers may be hesitant to adopt cloud-based software such as ours or to purchase cloud-based software from us and may prefer to purchase from such legacy software vendors. Oracle, SAP, and IBM are larger than we are and have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, larger marketing budgets, and significantly greater resources than we do. These vendors, as well as other competitors, may offer business planning software on a standalone basis at a low price or bundled as part of a larger product sale. Our competitors have offered, and may continue to offer, new products developed through acquisitions or organic development that more directly compete with our products and solutions. Our competitors may also seek to partner with other leading cloud providers.\nWe may also face competition from a variety of vendors of cloud-based and on-premises software products that address only a portion of the use cases addressed by our platform, including spreadsheets, which are used by virtually every business to some degree for business planning. Some of these applications may have greater functionality than our platform for the specific use cases for which they were designed, even if they lack the breadth of planning capabilities provided by our platform. In addition, other companies that provide cloud-based software in different target markets may develop software or acquire companies that operate in our target markets, and some potential customers may elect to develop their own internal software or simply use the manual processes that they have traditionally used. With the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect competition to intensify in the future.\nMany of our competitors have longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we do, and are able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of their products and services than we can. As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively to new or changing opportunities, technologies, operational requirements and industry standards, as well as to new challenges such as those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, our current or potential competitors may acquire or be acquired by third parties with greater available resources and the ability to initiate or withstand substantial price competition, and the resulting change in the competitive landscape could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. In addition, many of our competitors have established marketing relationships, access to larger customer bases, and major distribution agreements with consultants, systems integrators, and resellers. Our competitors may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that may further enhance their product\nofferings or resources. If our competitors are successful in bringing their products or services to market earlier than ours or if their products or services are more technologically capable than ours, then our revenue could be adversely affected. In addition, some of our competitors may offer their products and services at a lower price. If we are unable to achieve our target pricing levels, our operating results would be negatively affected. Pricing pressures and increased competition could result in reduced sales, reduced margins, losses or a failure to maintain or improve our competitive market position, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nIf the market for Connect Planning solutions develops more slowly than we expect or declines, or if we are unable to successfully capitalize on the market, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur success will depend to a substantial extent on continued growth in the demand for cloud-based Connected Planning and digital transformation solutions and on our ability to continue to capitalize on this demand. Many enterprises have invested substantial resources on legacy planning products, emerging point products and manual processes and, therefore, may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to enterprise cloud planning software. Our ability to capitalize on this market depends in part on our ability to sell customers on the benefits that the Connected Planning and digital transformation features of our platform can provide over their existing solutions. The growth rate of the Connected Planning market depends on a number of factors, including the cost, performance, and perceived value and security associated with Connected Planning software. If the market for Connect Planning solutions fails to grow, grows more slowly than we currently expect, or decreases in size, or if we are unable to successfully capitalize on the market, our business could be adversely affected.\nLegal and Compliance Risks\nWe typically provide service level commitments under our customer contracts. If we fail to meet these contractual commitments, we could be obligated to provide credits or refunds for prepaid amounts related to unused subscription services or face contract terminations, which could adversely affect our revenue.\nOur customer agreements typically provide service level commitments on a monthly basis. If we are unable to meet the stated service level commitments or suffer extended periods of unavailability for our platform, we may be contractually obligated to provide these customers with service credits, or we could face contract terminations, in which case we would be subject to refunds for prepaid amounts related to unused subscription services. Our revenue could be significantly affected if we suffer unexcused downtime under our agreements with our customers. Any extended service outages could adversely affect our reputation, ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers, revenue, and operating results.\nBecause we collect, process and store personal information and furthermore, because our platform could be used by customers to do the same, evolving domestic and international privacy and security laws, regulations and other obligations could result in additional costs and liabilities to us or inhibit sales of our platform.\nWe collect, process, store and transfer various types of information, including personally identifiable information or other sensitive information, for our customers and similar data about our employees, services providers, partners and potential customers in the normal course of business. Additionally, our customers can use our platform to collect, process, and store certain types of personal or identifying information regarding their employees and customers. In most cases we contractually prohibit our customers from using our platform to collect, process, or store sensitive information (such as personal health information or credit card information); however, our customers may breach such use prohibitions without our knowledge. Such a breach could result in our violation of the laws, rules, or regulations governing the collection, use, and protection of personal information, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and operating results. Moreover, as our customers face increased scrutiny for data privacy breaches, they may elect to transfer the risk to us through contractual provisions which may subject us to increasing levels of contractual liability for data privacy breaches.\nData privacy and security have become significant issues in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) and in many other countries where our platform is available. Laws, rules, and regulations in these jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection, use, storage, data residency, disclosure, and security of various types of data, including data that identifies or may be used to identify an individual, such as names, email addresses, and in some jurisdictions, Internet Protocol addresses. In the U.S., these include laws, rules, and regulations promulgated under the authority of the Federal Trade Commission, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and state laws relating to privacy and data security. Internationally, virtually every jurisdiction in which we operate has established its own data security and privacy legal framework with which we, or our customers, must comply. Interpretation of, and costs of compliance with, these laws, rules, and regulations and their application to our platform and services in the United States and foreign jurisdictions is ongoing and cannot be fully determined at this time.\nFurther, the regulatory framework for privacy and security issues worldwide is rapidly evolving, subject to change and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. Many federal, state, and foreign government bodies and agencies are considering adopting or amending laws, rules, and regulations regarding the collection, use, storage, data residency, security, and disclosure of personal information and breach notification procedures. In addition to government regulation, privacy advocates, and industry groups may propose new and different self-regulatory standards that may apply to us.\nRecent changes to privacy and security laws, including the CCPA, the GDPR, the Data Protection Act, and ongoing legal challenges to Model Clauses, could impact our business. Aspects of these laws, and their interpretation and enforcement remain unclear, and we cannot yet fully predict their impact on our business or operations. We have taken and will continue to take steps to comply with these and other new and changing privacy and security laws, rules, regulations and standards, but such laws, rules, regulations and standards may be unclear and we cannot assure you that our steps will be compliant. The interpretation and application of privacy and data protection laws, regulations, rules, and other standards remains uncertain and may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data management practices or the features of our platform. If so, we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our platform, which we may be unable to do in a commercially reasonable manner or at all, and which could have an adverse effect on our business. As a result of changing standards, we may experience reluctance or refusal by current or prospective multi-national customers or customers in geographies with strict privacy laws, like the EU and the United Kingdom, to use our products, and we may find it necessary or desirable to make further changes to our handling of personal data for those customers. The changing regulatory environment applicable to the handling personal data, and our actions taken in response, may cause us to assume additional liabilities or incur additional costs or regulatory penalties, and could result in our business, operating results, and financial condition being harmed. Our efforts to comply new data protection laws and regulations may cause us to incur substantial operational costs, require us to modify our data handling practices, and may otherwise adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nDespite our compliance efforts, we may fail to achieve compliance with applicable privacy or data protection laws and regulations as they evolve, or adhere to contractual obligations regarding the collection, processing, storage and transfer of data (including data from our customers, prospective customers, partners and employees), either due to internal or external factors such as resource limitations or a lack of vendor cooperation. Any actual or perceived failure to comply with these laws or obligations could result in enforcement action against us, including fines, claims for damages by customers and other affected individuals, damage to our reputation, and loss of goodwill (both in relation to existing customers and prospective customers), any of which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nFurthermore, the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, the laws, regulations, and policies that are applicable to the businesses of our customers may limit the use and adoption of, and reduce the overall demand for, our platform. Privacy concerns, whether valid or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our software particularly in certain industries and foreign countries.\nIndemnity provisions in various agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement and other losses.\nOur agreements with customers and other third parties generally include indemnification provisions under which we agree to indemnify them for losses suffered or incurred as a result of claims of intellectual property infringement, or other liabilities relating to or arising from our software, services or other contractual obligations. Large indemnity payments could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Although we normally contractually limit our liability with respect to such indemnity obligations, those limitations may not be fully enforceable in all situations, and we may still incur substantial liability under those agreements. Any dispute with a customer with respect to such obligations could have adverse effects on our relationship with that customer and other existing customers and new customers and harm our business and results of operations.\nWe could incur substantial costs in expanding, protecting or defending our intellectual property rights, and any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand.\nOur success and ability to compete depend in part upon our intellectual property and our ability to expand our existing intellectual property portfolio. We primarily rely on copyright, patent, trade secret and trademark laws, trade secret protection, and confidentiality or contractual agreements with our employees, customers, partners and others to protect our intellectual property rights. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may be inadequate and we may not be able to secure our intellectual property rights in the U.S. and international markets in which we operate.\nSome or all of our issued patents may be invalidated or otherwise limited, allowing our competitors to develop competitive offerings. In addition, issuance of a patent does not guarantee that we have a right to practice the patented invention or that we can effectively use that patent to limit the ability of other companies to develop competitive products. We cannot be certain that we are the first to use the inventions claimed in our issued patents or pending patent applications or otherwise used in our platform, that we are the first to file for protection in our patent applications, or that third parties do not have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from marketing or practicing our patented technology. While we have patents and patent applications pending, we may be unable to obtain patent protection for the technology covered in our patent applications or the patent protection may not be obtained quickly enough to meet our business needs. In addition, our existing patents and any patents issued in the future may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be successfully challenged by third parties. Effective patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our platform is available. The laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the United States (in particular, some foreign jurisdictions do not permit patent protection for software), and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. Additional uncertainty may result from changes to intellectual property legislation enacted in the United States, including the America Invents Act, and by other national governments and from interpretations of the intellectual property laws of the United States and other countries by applicable courts and agencies. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property.\nAlthough we generally enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants that have access to material confidential information and enter into confidentiality agreements with our customers and the parties with whom we have strategic relationships and business alliances, these agreements may not be effective in controlling access to and distribution of our platform and propriety information or preventing reverse engineering. Further, these agreements may not prevent competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially similar or superior to our platform.\nUnauthorized use of our intellectual property may have already occurred or may occur in the future. In order to protect our intellectual property rights, we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect these rights. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming, and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims, and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights and could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing. Our failure to secure, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights could seriously and adversely affect our brand and our business.\nWe may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights, which may be costly to defend, could require us to pay significant damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies.\nThere has been considerable activity in our industry to develop intellectual property and enforce intellectual property rights. Our success depends upon our not infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others. Our competitors, as well as a number of other entities and individuals, may own or claim to own intellectual property relating to our platform and underlying technology, and we may be unaware of the intellectual property rights that others may claim cover aspects of our platform or the underlying technology. In the future, others may claim that our platform and underlying technology infringe or violate their intellectual property rights.\nClaims of intellectual property rights infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights might require us to stop using technology found to violate a third party\u2019s rights, redesign our platform, which could require significant effort and expense and cause delays of releases, enter into costly settlement or license agreements, pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing or selling our platform. With respect to such technology for which intellectual property rights are claimed to be infringed or otherwise violated by our technology or the conduct of our business, if we cannot or do not license any infringed or otherwise violated technology on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or substitute similar non-infringing technology from another source, we could be forced to limit or stop selling our platform, we may not be able to meet our obligations to customers under our customer contracts, we may be unable to compete effectively, and our revenue and operating results could be adversely impacted. We may also be obligated to indemnify our customers and business partners or to pay substantial settlement costs, including royalty payments, in connection with any such claim or litigation and to obtain licenses, modify our platform, or refund fees, which could be costly. Even if we were to prevail in such a dispute, any litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming, damage our reputation and brand, delay or reduce potential sales, deter our partners from promoting adoption of our platform and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. As the number of competitors in our market increases, claims of intellectual property rights infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights may increase. Furthermore, our insurance coverage may not adequately cover losses from intellectual property rights infringement claims.\nWe employ third-party licensed software for use in or with our platform, and the inability to maintain these licenses or errors in the software we license could result in increased costs, or reduced service levels, which could adversely affect our business.\nOur platform incorporates certain third-party software obtained under licenses from other companies, and we use third-party software development tools as we continue to develop and enhance our platform. We anticipate that we will continue to rely on such third-party software in the future. If we are required to replace such software, commercially reasonable alternatives may not be available, and if they are available, they might require substantial investment of our time and resources. In addition, integration of the software used in our platform with new third-party software may require significant work and require substantial investment of our time and resources. Also, to the extent that our platform depends upon the successful operation of third-party software in conjunction with our software, any undetected errors or defects in this third-party software could prevent the deployment or impair the functionality of our platform, delay new feature introductions, result in a failure of our functionality or a security incident, and injure our reputation. Our use of additional or alternative third-party software would require us to enter into license agreements with third parties. In the event that we are not able to maintain our licenses to third-party software, or cannot obtain licenses to new software as needed, or in the event third-party software used in conjunction with our platform contains errors or defects, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nOur platform utilizes open source software, which could negatively affect our ability to offer our products and subject us to litigation or other adverse consequences.\nOur platform utilizes software governed by open source licenses, which may include, by way of example, the MIT License and the Apache License. The use of open source software involves a number of risks, many of which cannot be eliminated and could negatively affect our business. For example, the terms of various open source licenses have not been interpreted by United States courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to market our platform. By the terms of certain open source licenses, if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software and to make our proprietary software available under open source licenses. We may face claims alleging noncompliance with open source license terms or misappropriation or other violation of open source technology. These claims could result in litigation, damage our reputation in the open-source community, or require us to purchase a costly license, devote additional research or development resources to re-engineer our products or services, discontinue the sale of our products if re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely or cost-effective basis, require us to make the source code of our proprietary code generally available, or result in us being enjoined from the offering of components of our platform that contained the open source software, any of which would have a negative effect on our business and operating results. We also could be subject to lawsuits from other parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. Litigation could be costly for us to defend, have a negative effect on our operating results or financial condition, and could require us to devote additional research and development resources to re-engineer our platform. In addition to risks related to license requirements, usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of the software.\nWe are subject to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and similar laws, and failure to comply with these laws could subject us to criminal penalties or significant fines and harm our business and reputation.\nWe are subject to anti-corruption and anti-bribery and similar laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or the FCPA, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, the U.S. Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, and other anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and anti-money laundering laws in countries in which we conduct activities. Anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws have been enforced aggressively in recent years and are interpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees and agents from promising, authorizing, making or offering improper payments, or other benefits to government officials and others in the private sector. As we increase our international sales and business, our risks under these laws may increase.\nNoncompliance with these laws could subject us to investigations, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, other enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, significant fines, damages, other civil and criminal penalties or injunctions, adverse media coverage, and other consequences. Any investigations, actions, or sanctions could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe are subject to governmental export and import controls and economic sanctions programs that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we violate the controls or programs.\nWe are subject to certain U.S. export control and import laws and regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, U.S. Customs regulations, and various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Controls. Exports of our platform must be made in compliance with these laws and regulations. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we and certain of our employees could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties, including: the possible loss of export or import privileges; fines, which may be imposed on us and responsible employees or managers; and, in extreme cases, the incarceration of responsible employees or managers. Obtaining the necessary authorizations, including any required license, for a particular sale may be time-consuming, is not guaranteed, and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities.\nWe incorporate encryption technology into our platform. These encryption products and the underlying technology may be exported outside of the United States only with the required export authorizations, including by license, a license exception or other appropriate government authorizations. In addition, various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including through import permitting and licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our platform or could limit our customers\u2019 ability to implement our platform in those countries. Governmental regulation of encryption technology and regulation of imports or exports of encryption products, or our failure to obtain required import or export approval for our platform, when applicable, could harm our international sales and adversely affect our revenue. Furthermore, U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions programs prohibit the shipment of certain products and services to countries, governments, and persons targeted by U.S. sanctions. Any violations of such economic embargoes and trade sanction regulations could have negative consequences, including government investigations, penalties, and reputational harm.\nChanges in our platform or future changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction and sale of our platform in international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our platform globally or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our platform to certain countries, governments, or persons altogether. Any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation, or change in the countries, governments, persons, or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our platform by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our platform to, existing or potential customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our platform or limitation on our ability to export or sell our platform would likely adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe incur significant costs, devote substantial management time, and may have difficulty attracting qualified board members as a result of operating as a public company.\nAs a public company, we are subject to various securities rules and regulations, including the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the New York Stock Exchange listing standards, and rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange. We expect that complying with these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting, and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming, and costly, and place significant strain on our personnel, systems, and resources. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we establish and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Compliance with these various requirements has increased, and we expect will continue to increase, our legal and financial compliance costs and makes some activities more time consuming and costly. In addition, our management and other personnel need to divert attention from operational and other business matters to devote substantial time\nto these public company requirements, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. Although we have hired additional employees to help comply with these requirements, we may need to hire more employees in the future or engage outside consultants, which will increase our costs and expenses.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. Compliance with evolving laws, regulations and standards may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management's time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may impose fines, initiate legal proceedings or take other action against us and our business may be adversely affected.\nAs a result of the rules and regulations applicable to public companies, it may be more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. It may also be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee, and qualified executive officers.\nAs a public company we file certain information publicly, which provides visibility into our business and financial condition. We are currently subject to litigation related to our public filings, and may continue to be subject to threatened or actual litigation in the future. If such claims are successful, our business, and operating results could be adversely affected, and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them and the diversion of management resources, could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements, or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.\nAs a public company, we are required to design and maintain internal controls over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and provide a management report on the internal controls over financial reporting, which must be attested to by our independent registered public accounting firm. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we will file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and financial officers. We are also continuing to improve our internal control over financial reporting, including through our internal audit team. In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources, including accounting-related costs and significant management oversight.\nOur current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. Further, weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. If we fail to develop or maintain effective controls, encounter difficulties in their implementation or improvement, or identify a material weakness in our controls, our operating results could be harmed or we could fail to meet our reporting obligations and may be required to restate our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we are required to include in our periodic reports that will be filed with the SEC. Our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control over financial reporting is documented, designed, or operating. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could result in regulatory scrutiny and sanctions, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, and subject us to stockholder or other third party litigation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness and operating results and a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\nFinancial and Credit Risks\nIf we are unable to achieve and sustain a level of liquidity sufficient to support our operations and fulfill our obligations, our business, operating results and financial position could be adversely affected.\nWe actively monitor and manage our cash and cash equivalents so that sufficient liquidity is available to fund our operations and other corporate purposes. As an example of our liquidity management, in April 2020, we amended our credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (\u201cWells Fargo\u201d) to, among other things, increase the aggregate revolving credit commitment amount to allow us to borrow up to $60.0 million, subject to the terms of the credit agreement, including the accounts receivable borrowing base, and extend the maturity date of the revolving credit facility from April 2020 to April 2022. In the future, increased levels of liquidity may be required to adequately support our operations and initiatives and to mitigate the effects of business challenges or unforeseen circumstances. If we are unable to achieve and sustain such increased levels of liquidity, we may suffer adverse consequences including reduced investment in our platform and its functionality, difficulties in executing our business plan and fulfilling our obligations, and other operational challenges. Any of these developments could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial position.\nWe may face exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nWhile our international contracts are sometimes denominated in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of our revenue is in foreign currencies and the majority of our international costs are denominated in local currencies. Over time, an increasing portion of our international contracts may be denominated in local currencies. Therefore, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may affect our operating results when translated into U.S. dollars. We do not currently engage in currency hedging activities to limit the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. However, in the future, we may engage in hedging activities including the use of derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not successfully offset any of the risks associated with exchange rate fluctuations, including uncertainty caused by volatility in the currency exchange rates. Moreover, the use of hedging instruments may introduce additional risks if we are unable to structure effective hedges with such instruments.\nWe may not be able to secure additional financing on favorable terms, or at all, to meet our future capital needs.\nWe have funded our operations since inception primarily through equity financings and payments by customers. We do not know when or if our operations will generate sufficient cash to fund our ongoing operations. In the future, we may require additional capital to respond to business opportunities, challenges, strategic transactions, a decline in the level of customer prepayments or unforeseen circumstances. We may determine to engage in equity or debt financings or enter into credit facilities for these or other reasons, and we may not be able to timely secure additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, or at all, especially during a global economic downturn. Any debt financing obtained by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential strategic transactions. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity, convertible debt securities or other securities convertible into equity, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership of our company, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited.\nIf we default on our credit obligations, our operations may be interrupted and our business could be seriously harmed.\nWe have a credit facility that we may draw on to finance our operations, strategic transactions, and other corporate purposes. Our obligations pursuant to this credit facility are secured by a first priority lien on our assets for the benefit of the lenders. Our credit facility contains financial and operating covenants, including maintenance of a specific minimum tangible net worth, customary limitations on the incurrence of certain indebtedness and liens, restrictions on certain intercompany transactions, and limitations on the amount of dividends and stock repurchases. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, and breaches of these covenants or other obligations in the credit facility, or the occurrence of certain events specified in the credit facility, could result in a default under the credit facility and any future financial agreements into which we may enter. If we default on the obligations under our credit facility, our lenders may pursue various remedial actions against us, including:\n\u2022\nrequiring repayment of any outstanding amounts drawn on our credit facility;\n\u2022\nterminating our credit facility;\n\u2022\ndisposing of our assets subject to the lien; and\n\u2022\nrequiring us to pay significant damages.\nIf any of these events occur, our operations may be interrupted and our ability to fund our operations or obligations, as well as our business, could be seriously harmed. For more information on our credit facility, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nWe may not be able to utilize a significant portion of our net operating loss or research tax credit carryforwards, which could adversely affect our potential profitability.\nWe have federal and state net operating loss carryforwards due to prior period losses, which if not utilized will begin to expire in fiscal 2029 and 2025 for federal and state purposes, respectively. These net operating loss carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities, which could adversely affect our potential profitability.\nAlso, under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\u201cTax Reform Act\u201d), tax losses generated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, may be utilized to offset no more than 80% of taxable income annually. Although the subsequent CARES Act modified the Tax Reform Act by, among other things, eliminating the aforementioned 80% limitation for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2021, we may still face reduced availability of net operating losses in future taxable years, which could adversely affect our potential profitability.\nIn addition, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes, such as research tax credits, in any taxable year may be limited if we experience an \u201cownership change.\u201d Such an \u201cownership change\u201d generally occurs if one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who own at least 5% of our stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. We completed an analysis under Sections 382 and 383 of the Code for the Company\u2019s tax years through January 31, 2019, and determined two \u201cownership changes\u201d occurred, one in fiscal 2011 and one in fiscal 2012. We believe utilization of our net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards have become limited. This could result in increased U.S. federal income tax liability for us if we generate taxable income in a future period. Limitations on the use of net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes could also increase our state tax liability. The use of our tax attributes will also be limited to the extent that we do not generate positive taxable income in future tax periods.\nWe are subject to the tax laws of various jurisdictions, which are subject to changes and to interpretation, which could harm our future results.\nWe are subject to income, sales, use, value added, and other similar taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions, and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, certain non-deductible expenses\nas a result of acquisitions, the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the interpretation and application of existing tax laws within a jurisdiction, and changes in federal, state, or international tax laws and accounting principles.\nChanges to various tax laws, rules and regulations are currently being considered by the United States and other countries where we do business. Certain of these proposed changes could be applied solely or disproportionately to services provided over the internet. These tax initiatives, if implemented, could result in additional tax obligations that we are required to pay or adversely affect our sales activity due to the inherent cost increase the taxes would represent and ultimately result in a negative impact on our operating results and cash flows. In addition, existing tax laws, rules, or regulations could be interpreted, modified, or applied adversely to us (possibly with retroactive effect), which could require us or our customers to pay additional tax amounts, or require us or our customers to pay fines, penalties and interest for past amounts. If we are unsuccessful in collecting such taxes from our customers, we could be held liable for such costs, thereby adversely affecting our operating results and cash flows.\nSales and use, value added, and similar tax laws and rates vary greatly by jurisdiction and are subject to varying interpretations that change over time. We do not collect sales and use, value added, and similar taxes in all jurisdictions in which we have sales, based on our belief that such taxes are not applicable or that we are not required to collect such taxes with respect to the jurisdiction. Certain jurisdictions in which we do not collect such taxes may assert that such taxes are applicable, which could result in tax assessments, penalties, and interest, and we may be required to collect such taxes in the future.\nOur customers may fail to pay us in accordance with the terms of their agreements, necessitating action by us to compel payment.\nWe typically enter into multiple year, non-cancelable arrangements with our customers. If customers fail to pay us under the terms of our agreements, we may be adversely affected both from the inability to collect amounts due and the cost of enforcing the terms of our contracts, including litigation. The risk of such negative effects increases with the term length of our customer arrangements. Furthermore, some of our customers may seek bankruptcy protection or other similar relief, including as a result of the impacts and disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and fail to pay amounts due to us, or pay those amounts more slowly, either of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results for periods prior and subsequent to such change. For example, recent new standards issued by the FASB that could materially impact our financial statements include certain changes to accounting for leases. We may adopt one or more of these standards retrospectively to prior periods, and the adoption may result in an adverse change to previously reported results. Additionally, the adoption of these standards may potentially require enhancements or changes in our systems and could require our financial management to devote significant time and resources to implementing those changes.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe stock price of our common stock may be volatile and may decline regardless of our operating performance and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile. In addition to factors discussed in this report, the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nthe COVID-19 pandemic and the extent to which, and for how long, it impacts our business and that of our customers and prospective customers;\n\u2022\noverall performance of the equity markets;\n\u2022\nour operating performance, including key metrics, and the performance of other similar companies;\n\u2022\nchanges in our projected operating results that we provide to the public, our failure to meet these projections or changes in recommendations by securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock;\n\u2022\nchanges in our financial, operating or other metrics, regardless of whether we consider those metrics as reflective of the current state or long-term prospects of our business, and how those results compare to securities analyst expectations;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations, new software or enhancements to services, acquisitions, strategic alliances, or significant agreements by us or by our competitors;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in our services due to computer hardware, software, or network problems;\n\u2022\na data breach or other security incident involving us, or one of our customers or partners, or another company in the cloud planning software market;\n\u2022\nannouncements of customer additions and customer cancellations or delays in customer purchases;\n\u2022\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nthe economy as a whole, market conditions in our industry and the industries of our customers;\n\u2022\nthe sale, purchase, or exercise of a significant block of our common stock;\n\u2022\nthe impact of environmental, social, governance or other matters on our reputation or investor confidence in our operations;\n\u2022\nthe size of our market float; and\n\u2022\nany other factors discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. Stock prices of many technology companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, stockholders have filed securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. For example, in August 2020, a purported stockholder filed a putative securities class action complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against us and certain of our executive officers. This lawsuit is further described in Note 9, Commitment and Contingencies, in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Although we believe this lawsuit lacks merit and intend to vigorously defend against it, this matter, and any other similar matters, could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources, and the attention of management from our business and adversely affect our business.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more analysts cease or reduce coverage of us, the trading price for our common stock would be negatively affected. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our common stock price would likely decline.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, stockholders must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.\nDelaware law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:\n\u2022\na classified board of directors so that not all members of our board of directors are elected at one time, which could delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquiror;\n\u2022\nthe right of our board of directors, subject to the rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock, to the extent such preferred stock is issued by the board of directors in the future, to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director, could impede an attempt by stockholders to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022\na prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by a majority vote of our entire board of directors, the chairman of our board of directors or our chief executive officer, which could delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures with which stockholders must comply to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquiror from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquiror\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nIn addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. This provision may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from engaging in a business combination with us even if the business combination would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. A Delaware corporation may opt out of this provision by express provision in its original certificate of incorporation or by amendment to its certificate of incorporation or bylaws approved by its stockholders. However, we have not opted out of this provision.\nThese and other provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws, and Delaware law could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are opposed by our then-current board of directors, including delay or impede a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest involving our company. The existence of these provisions could negatively affect the price of our common stock and limit opportunities for you to realize value in a corporate transaction.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for many types of disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees and may discourage these types of lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and\nrestated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nUncertain global economic and market conditions may negatively impact our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business depends on the overall demand for information technology and on the economic health of our current and prospective customers in the United States and abroad. Any significant weakening of the economy in the United States or in regions globally like Europe and Asia, more limited availability of credit, a reduction in business confidence and activity, decreased government spending, perceived impact of global trade barriers like tariffs and sanctions and the corresponding retaliatory actions, economic uncertainty, or other difficulties may affect one or more of the sectors or countries in which we sell our platform. Global economic and political uncertainty, including the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, Brexit, increased tariffs and international trade disputes, may cause some of our customers or potential customers to curtail spending, scale back their digital transformation efforts, delay their expansion of Anaplan use cases, result in new regulatory and cost challenges to our international operations and cause customers to delay or reduce their technology spending overall. In addition, a strong dollar could reduce demand for our products in countries with relatively weaker currencies. Global economic conditions and market conditions may also continue to experience volatility and remain uncertain for an indefinite period of time as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect our business will be impacted in a variety of ways by these conditions because, among other reasons, some prospective and existing customers may curtail business spending, there may be greater unpredictability in some customers\u2019 ability to pay for their subscriptions to our platform, business disruptions for us and/or our customers are likely to persist in at least some jurisdictions and travel by us and our partners to customer sites has been and is expected to remain limited. These adverse conditions have, in part, resulted in and may result in certain of our customers and prospective customers deferring or delaying buying decisions and project implementations, prolonged sales cycles, and increased requests for extended payment terms. These adverse conditions could result in reductions in the rate of enterprise software spending generally, sales of our platform, longer sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies, lower renewal rates, and increased price competition. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial position.\nCatastrophic events and other events beyond our control may disrupt our business and adversely affect our operating results.\nNatural disasters, catastrophic events, and other events beyond our control may cause damage or disruption to our business. As an example, our corporate headquarters are located in San Francisco, California and the west coast of the United States contains active earthquake zones. An earthquake affecting our headquarters may result in disruption to our business and operations. Additionally, we rely on our network and third-party infrastructure and enterprise applications, internal technology systems, and our website for our development, marketing, operational support, hosted services, and sales activities and such infrastructure and systems may also be affected by natural disasters or other catastrophic events. For example, our data centers are critical infrastructure located in the United States, the Netherlands, and Germany, including in areas with active earthquake zones. From time to time, global pandemics may result from outbreak of diseases such as the MERS, SARS, avian flu and COVID-19, which may result in a material adverse impact on our or our customers\u2019 and partners\u2019 business operations including reduction or suspension of operations in the U.S. or certain parts of the world. We serve a wide range of customers with international operations in varying industries including manufacturing. Depending upon the continuity and severity of pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, our customers and partners may suspend or delay their engagement with us, or our partners may have difficulty engaging with customers and delivering the services we typically expect them to provide, which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Although we maintain disaster and crisis recovery plans, in the event of an earthquake, hurricane, flood, natural disaster or catastrophic event such as fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, breach of security protocols, global pandemics like the COVID-19 pandemic, cyber-attack, war, or terrorist attack, such plans or the disaster recovery plans established by the third-party data centers and other infrastructure that we rely on may prove to be inadequate and we may be unable to continue our operations and may endure system interruptions, reputational harm, delays in our product development, lengthy interruptions in our services, breaches of data security, and\nloss of critical data, all of which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Furthermore, in the event of a catastrophic event or other crisis, our insurance coverage may not adequately compensate us for any losses that we may incur.", "PERMNO": 18141, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "PLAN"}
