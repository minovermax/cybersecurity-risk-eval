Risk Factors\nRisk Factor Summary\nOur business is subject to a number of risks of which you should be aware before making an investment decision. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022Macroeconomic and other factors beyond our control;\n\u2022Contraction in the global economy or low levels of economic growth;\n\u2022The COVID-19 pandemic and related events, including the various measures implemented or adopted to respond to the pandemic;\n\u2022Risks inherent to the timeshare and hospitality industry, including reliance on tourism and travel, and competition within the industry;\n\u2022Material harm to our business if we breach our license agreement with Hilton or the agreement is terminated;\n\u2022Our ability to obtain Hilton\u2019s consent to our use of its trademarks;\n\u2022The quality and reputation of the Hilton brands and affiliation with the Hilton Honors loyalty program;\n\u2022The ability of our critical marketing programs and activities to generate tour flow and contract sales and increase our revenues;\n\u2022Financial and operational risks related to acquisitions and business ventures, including partnerships or joint ventures;\n\u2022Our dependence on development activities and risks related to our real estate investments;\n\u2022The geographic concentration of properties we manage;\n\u2022Our current operations and future expansion outside of the United States;\n\u2022Our ability to hire, retain and motivate key personnel and our reliance on the services of our management team and employees;\n\u2022A decline in developed or acquired VOI inventory or failure to enter into and maintain fee-for service agreements or inability to source VOI inventory or finance sales if we or third-party developers are unable to access capital;\n\u2022Our limited underwriting standards and a possible decline in the default rates or other credit metrics underlying our timeshare financing receivables;\n\u2022The expiration, termination or renegotiation of our management agreements;\n\u2022Disagreements with VOI owners or HOAs or the failure of HOA boards to collect sufficient fees;\n\u2022Failure to keep pace with developments in technology;\n\u2022Lack of awareness or understanding of and failure to effectively manage our social media;\n\u2022Cyber-attacks or our failure to maintain the security and integrity of company, employee, customer or third-party data;\n\u2022Our ability to comply with a wide variety of laws, regulations and policies, including those applicable to our international operations;\n\u2022Changes in privacy laws, tax laws or accounting rules or regulations;\n\u2022Our substantial indebtedness and other contractual obligations, restrictions imposed on us by certain of our debt agreements and instruments and our variable rate indebtedness which subjects us to interest rate risk;\n\u2022Failure to comply with agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness;\n\u2022Our ability, or the ability of our subsidiaries, to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness;\n\u2022Potential liabilities related to our spin-off from Hilton, including U.S. federal income tax liabilities, liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and the possible assumption of responsibilities for obligations allocated to Hilton or Park;\n\u2022The sufficiency of any indemnity Hilton or Park is required to provide us and the amount of any indemnity we may be required to provide Hilton or Park related to the period prior to the spin-off;\n\u2022The ability of our board of directors to change corporate policies without stockholder approval;\n\u2022Anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law and consent requirements in our license agreement with Hilton that may deter a potential business combination transaction;\n\u2022Fluctuation in the market price and trading volume of our common stock;\n\u2022The actions of activist stockholders;\n\u2022Our ability to integrate the Diamond business successfully or realize the anticipated cost savings, synergies and growth in operating results;\n\u2022Our ability to effectively manage our expanded operations resulting from the Diamond Acquisition, including the trust system associated with the Diamond business; and\n\u2022Our ability to use Hilton's trademarks in connection with the conversion of Diamond properties.\nThe foregoing is only a summary of our risks. These and other risks are discussed more fully in the section entitled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisk Factors\nWe are subject to various risks that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and stock price. You should carefully consider the risk factors discussed below, in addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Further, other risks and uncertainties not presently known to management or that management currently deems less significant also may result in material and adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and stock price. The risks below also include forward-looking statements; and actual results and events may differ substantially from those discussed or highlighted in these forward-looking statements. See \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nMacroeconomic and other factors beyond our control can adversely affect and reduce demand for our products and services.\nMacroeconomic and other factors beyond our control can reduce demand for our products and services, including demand for timeshare products. These factors include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022changes in general economic conditions, including low consumer confidence, high unemployment levels and depressed real estate prices resulting from the severity and duration of any downturn in the U.S. or global economy;\n\u2022war, political conditions or civil unrest, violence or terrorist activities or threats and heightened travel security measures instituted in response to these events;\n\u2022the financial and general business condition of the travel industry;\n\u2022statements, actions or interventions by governmental officials related to travel and the resulting negative public perception of such travel;\n\u2022conditions that negatively shape public perception of travel, including travel-related accidents and outbreaks of pandemic or contagious diseases, such as COVID-19, Ebola, avian flu, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), H1N1 (swine flu) and the Zika virus;\n\u2022cyber-attacks;\n\u2022price and availability of natural resources and supplies;\n\u2022natural or manmade disasters, such as earthquakes, windstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes, typhoons, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, floods, drought, fires, oil spills and nuclear incidents, and the effects of climate change increasing the frequency and severity of extreme weather events; and\n\u2022organized labor activities, which could cause a diversion of business from resorts involved in labor negotiations and loss of business generally for the resorts we manage as a result of certain labor tactics.\nAny one or more of these factors can adversely affect, and from time to time have adversely affected, individual resorts, particular regions and our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nContraction in the global economy or low levels of economic growth could adversely affect our revenues and profitability as well as limit or slow our future growth.\nConsumer demand for products and services provided by the timeshare industry is closely linked to the performance of the general economy and is sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels. Decreased global or regional demand for products and services provided by the timeshare industry can be especially pronounced during periods of economic contraction or low levels of economic growth, and the recovery period in our industry may lag overall economic improvement. Declines in demand for our products and services due to general economic conditions could negatively affect our business by decreasing the revenues we are able to generate from our VOI sales, financing activities and Club and resort operations. In addition, many of the expenses associated with our business, including personnel costs, interest, rent, property taxes, insurance and utilities, are relatively fixed. During a period of overall economic weakness, if we are unable to meaningfully decrease these costs as demand for our products and services decreases, our business operations and financial performance may be adversely affected.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and related events, including the various measures implemented or adopted to respond to the pandemic and the global economic downturn, have had, and will likely continue to have, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations for the foreseeable future.\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic and the various measures taken or implemented by governments and other authorities in the United States and around the world, businesses, organizations and individuals have had, and will likely continue to have, an adverse impact on domestic and international travel, consumer demand for travel, commercial activities across the travel, lodging and hospitality industries, businesses generally, and consequently, on our business and operations. In response to the pandemic and various governmental orders, we took certain significant actions to ensure the continuity of our business and operations beginning at the end of the first quarter 2020, including temporarily closing operations at substantially all of our resorts, closing substantially all of our sales centers, implementing salary reductions and workforce furloughs, implementing hiring freezes, drawing down substantial amounts under our credit facility as a precautionary measure to ensure liquidity and amending both our credit facility and our timeshare facility to provide near-term flexibility on certain maintenance and financial covenants and ratios. On October 15, 2020, our board of directors approved a workforce reduction plan that resulted in the reduction of our workforce by approximately 1,500 members.\nSince reopening beginning in May 2020, our resorts and sales centers are open and operating in accordance with local rules, restrictions and conditions. We have implemented a variety of measures that are required, or we believe are advisable, for our business with the goal of keeping our customers, owners, team members, and the communities we serve as safe as reasonably feasible from the COVID-19 virus. These measures include additional cleaning and sanitation of our resorts and common areas, providing our team members with personal protective equipment, requiring our guests and owners use face masks based on CDC or other federal, state, or local health guidelines, and implementing physical distancing practices.\nThe conditions caused by the pandemic continue to be unprecedented and rapidly changing. Accordingly, there remains significant uncertainties and risks around the duration of the pandemic in the US and around the world, the breadth and duration of business disruptions resulting from COVID-19, the pandemic\u2019s impact on the global economy, consumer confidence, various businesses, and, consequently, our business and operations.\nSome of these uncertainties and risks may include the following:\n\u2022potentiality of additional waves or variants, which may result in further disruptions and additional or reimplemented governmental COVID-19 restrictions, closure orders and/or or \u201cshelter in place\u201d health orders, or similar restrictions;\n\u2022new orders, and conflicting directives by different governmental bodies or changes in federal and local policy, rules or regulations, which could disrupt, change, or otherwise adversely impact our safety protocols and measures that are intended to protect our guests, owners, and team members;\n\u2022the ability of vaccines to protect against infection and severe illness, including new variants of the virus;\n\u2022travel bans, quarantine requirements upon entry, and restrictions on travel among the states within the U.S., including past requirements in states where we have a significant number of resorts such as Hawaii and New York, as well as between the U.S. and specific countries, including restrictions placed by foreign governments on citizens of the U.S. entering their countries;\n\u2022continued closures and/or curtailment of operations at many popular tourist destinations, reducing the demand for leisure travel;\n\u2022changing behavior of individuals and unwillingness to travel and stay at hotels, resorts, timeshares, and other lodging facilities due to the pandemic which may continue beyond the time global health and safety conditions improve;\n\u2022various safety measures that-\nomay be challenging to implement due to uncertainties in how to correctly implement such measures, lack of availability of needed supplies or other issues,\nowe have already adopted but may need to change rapidly based on the status of the pandemic, applicable governmental actions, industry practices, and guidance or recommendations from leading healthcare experts,\nomay result in significant costs to us, or\nomay cause guests to not visit our resorts because they do not want to abide by such measures, do not fully understand or agree with such requested measures, and/or are wary of the risk of infection despite such measures,\n\u2022potential cases of infection and transmission at our resorts despite the implementation of our safety measures efforts, which would be disruptive to our business and may lead to exposure to assertions of liability,\n\u2022our ability to effectively operate our business in light of significant workforce changes and labor shortages, and our ability to recruit additional talent as needed;\n\u2022supply chain delays and shortages that may impact our ability to operate our resorts or continue development activities;\n\u2022other actions we have taken or may take, or decisions we have made or may make, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic that may result in investigations, legal claims (with or without merit) or litigation against us, and\n\u2022inability to repay on time or at all the significant increases in our indebtedness and inadequacies of our liquidity, limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness or access available debt capital, and recent amendments to our credit facility and Timeshare Facility, if the pandemic worsens and continues for significant duration.\nIn addition, many of the other risk factors described herein are heightened by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic conditions, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, access to financing and liquidity.\nWe are subject to business, financial and operating risks inherent to the timeshare and hospitality industry, any of which could reduce our revenues and limit opportunities for growth.\nOur business is subject to a number of business, financial and operating risks inherent to the timeshare industry, including:\n\u2022changes in the supply and demand for our products and services;\n\u2022our ability to securitize the receivables that we originate in connection with VOI sales;\n\u2022delays in or cancellations of planned or future development or refurbishment projects;\n\u2022the financial condition of third-party developers with whom we do business;\n\u2022relationships with third-party developers, our Club members and HOAs;\n\u2022changes in desirability of geographic regions of our resorts and affiliated resorts, geographic concentration of our operations and shortages of desirable locations for development;\n\u2022changes in operating costs, including energy, food, employee compensation and benefits and insurance;\n\u2022increases in costs due to inflation or otherwise, including increases in our operating costs, that may not be fully offset by price and fee increases in our business;\n\u2022changes in taxes and/or governmental regulations that influence or set wages, prices, interest rates or construction and maintenance procedures and costs;\n\u2022significant increases in cost of health care coverage for employees, and various government regulation with respect to health care coverage;\n\u2022shortages of labor or labor disruptions;\n\u2022the availability and cost of capital necessary for us, and third-party developers with whom we do business, to fund investments, capital expenditures and service debt obligations;\n\u2022significant competition from other timeshare businesses and hospitality providers in the markets in which we operate;\n\u2022market and/or consumer perception and reputation of timeshare companies and the industry in general;\n\u2022the economic environment for and trends in the tourism and hospitality industry, which may impact the vacationing and purchasing decisions of consumers;\n\u2022the influence of social media on consumers\u2019 lodging decisions;\n\u2022increases in the use of third-party and competitor internet services to book hotel reservations, secure short-term lodging accommodations and market vacation rental properties;\n\u2022legal, business or regulatory issues unique to the geographic locations of our resorts and affiliated resorts, which could increase the cost of or result in delays in entering into or expanding in those locations.\n\u2022limited underwriting standards due to the real-time nature of industry sales practices;\n\u2022private resales of VOIs and the sale of VOIs in the secondary market; and\n\u2022the impact on the industry of unlawful or deceptive third-party VOI resale or vacation package sales schemes.\nAny of these factors could increase our costs or limit or reduce the prices we are able to charge for our products and services or otherwise affect our ability to maintain existing properties or products, develop new properties, products and services or source VOI supply from third parties. As a result, any of these factors can reduce our revenues and limit opportunities for growth.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry.\nThe timeshare industry is highly competitive. The Hilton brands we use compete with the timeshare brands affiliated with major hotel chains in national and international venues, and we compete generally with the vacation rental options generally offered by the lodging and travel industry (e.g., hotels, resorts, home and apartment sharing services, and condominium rentals) and other options such as cruises.\nWe also compete with other timeshare developers for sales of VOIs based principally on location, quality of accommodations, price, service levels and amenities, financing terms, quality of service, terms of property use, reservation systems, flexibility for VOI owners to exchange into time at other timeshare properties, or other travel rewards, including access to hotel loyalty programs, as well as brand name recognition and reputation. A number of our competitors are significantly larger than we are and have potentially greater access to capital resources and broader marketing, sales and distribution capabilities. We also compete with numerous other smaller owners and operators of timeshare resorts, as well as home and apartment sharing services that market available privately owned residential properties that can be rented on a nightly, weekly or monthly basis. In addition, we are in competition with national and independent timeshare resale companies and members reselling existing VOIs on the secondary market, which could reduce demand or prices for sales of new VOIs. We also compete with other timeshare management companies in the management of resorts on behalf of owners on the basis of quality, cost, types of services offered and relationship.\nWe compete for property acquisitions and partnerships with entities that have similar investment objectives as we do. This competition could limit the number of, or negatively affect the cost of, suitable investment opportunities available to us.\nRecent and potential future consolidation in the highly fragmented timeshare industry may increase competition. Consolidation may create competitors that enjoy significant advantages resulting from, among other things, a lower cost of, and greater access to, capital and enhanced operating efficiencies.\nOur ability to remain competitive and to attract and retain members depends on our success in distinguishing the quality and value of our products and services from those offered by others. If we cannot compete successfully in these areas or if our marketing and sales efforts are not successful and we are unable to convert customers to a sufficient number of sales, this could negatively affect our operating profits and margins and our ability to recover the expense of our marketing programs and grow our business, diminish our market share and reduce our earnings.\nRisks Related to the Operation of Our Business\nWe do not own the Hilton brands and our business will be materially harmed if we breach our license agreement with Hilton or it is terminated.\nFollowing the spin-off, Hilton retained ownership of the Hilton-branded trademarks, tradenames and certain related intellectual property used in the operation of our business. We entered into a license agreement with Hilton granting us the right to use the Hilton-branded trademarks, trade names and related intellectual property in our business for the term of the agreement. The license agreement was amended and restated in connection with the Diamond Acquisition to facilitate our integration of the Diamond business and create a license fee structure related to the integration. If we breach our obligations under the license agreement, Hilton may be entitled to terminate the license agreement or terminate our rights to use the Hilton brands and other Hilton intellectual property at properties that do not meet applicable standards and policies, or to exercise other remedies. Pursuant to the license agreement, Hilton would be the sole owner of certain licensed marks related to any new brands associated with the Diamond portfolio that are developed by us. If we default under the license agreement, we could lose the right to use one or more of such new brands.\nThe termination of the license agreement or exercise of other remedies would materially harm our business and results of operations and impair our ability to market and sell our products and maintain our competitive position. For example, if we are not able to rely on the strength of the Hilton brands to attract prospective members and guests in the marketplace, our revenue and profits would decline and our marketing and sales expenses would increase. If we are not able to use Hilton\u2019s marketing databases and corporate-level advertising channels to reach potential members and guests, including Hilton\u2019s internet address as a channel through which to market available inventory, our member\ngrowth would be adversely affected and our revenue would materially decline, and it is uncertain whether we would be able to replace the revenue associated with those channels. The loss of the right to use licensed marks related to any new brand, such as any brand associated with the Diamond portfolio, could materially adversely affect our ability to generate revenue and profits from an acquired business or new brand.\nEven if the license agreement remains in effect, the termination of our rights to use any branded trademarks, trade names and related intellectual property licensed to us by Hilton at properties that fail to meet applicable standards and policies, or any deterioration of quality or reputation of the Hilton brands (even deterioration not leading to termination of our rights under the license agreement or not caused by us), could also harm our reputation and impair our ability to market and sell our products, which could materially harm our business.\nIn addition, if license agreement terms relating to the Hilton Honors loyalty program terminate, we would not be able to offer Hilton Honors points to our members and guests. This would adversely affect our ability to sell our products, offer the flexibility associated with our Club membership and sustain our collection performance on our timeshare financing receivables portfolio. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Key Agreements Related to the Spin-Off-License Agreement.\u201d\nWe will rely on Hilton to consent to our use of its trademarks at new properties we manage in the future.\nUnder the terms of our license agreement with Hilton, we are required to obtain Hilton\u2019s consent to use its trademarks in circumstances specified in the license agreement. Hilton may reject a proposed project in certain circumstances. Any requirements to obtain Hilton\u2019s consent to our expansion plans, including the planned conversion of the acquired Diamond resorts to Hilton branded properties, or the need to identify and secure alternative expansion opportunities because Hilton does not allow us to use its trademarks with proposed new projects, may delay implementation of our expansion plans, cause us to incur additional expense or reduce the financial viability of our projects. Further, if Hilton does not permit us to use its trademarks in connection with our expansion plans, our ability to expand our Hilton-branded timeshare business would cease and our ability to remain competitive may be materially adversely affected. See \u201cOur ability to integrate the acquired Diamond business could be harmed if Hilton does not consent to the use of their trademarks in connection with the conversion of Diamond resorts.\nOur business depends on the quality and reputation of the Hilton brands and affiliation with the Hilton Honors loyalty program.\nCurrently, our Legacy HGV products and services are offered under the Hilton brand names and affiliated with the Hilton Honors loyalty program, and we intend to continue to develop and offer products and services under the Hilton brands and affiliated with the Hilton Honors loyalty program in the future, including the products acquired in the Diamond Acquisition. In addition, the license agreement contains significant prohibitions on our ability to own or operate properties that are not Hilton brand names. The concentration of our products and services under these brands and program may expose us to risks of brand or program deterioration, or reputational decline, that are greater than if our portfolio were more diverse. Furthermore, as we are not the owner of the Hilton brands or the Hilton Honors loyalty program, changes to these brands and program or our access to them, including our ability to buy points to offer to our members and potential members, could negatively affect our business. Any failure by Hilton to protect the trademarks, tradenames and intellectual property that we license from it could reduce the value of the Hilton brands and also harm our business. If these brands or program deteriorate or materially change in an adverse manner, or the reputation of these brands or program declines, our market share, reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe rely on several critical marketing programs and activities to generate tour flow and contract sales and increase our revenues.\nWe rely on several critical marketing activities to engage with potential VOI purchasers for generating tour flow, contract sales and financing fees, resort management and other revenues. These include targeted direct marketing, transfers of calls by Hilton of its customers to us pursuant to an agreement, and the successful implementation of our digital and technology-based marketing strategy. Any significant changes to one or more factors that adversely affect such marketing activities, such as changes in consumer behavior and preference for vacations or a decrease in the number of calls being transferred from Hilton due to increasing consumer reliance on digital tools, will adversely impact our revenue.\nWe may experience financial and operational risks in connection with acquisitions and other opportunistic business ventures.\nWe will consider strategic acquisitions to expand our inventory options and distribution capabilities; however, we may be unable to identify attractive acquisition candidates or complete transactions on favorable terms. Future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and/or the assumption of contingent liabilities. These acquisitions may also be structured in such a way that we will be assuming unknown or undisclosed liabilities or obligations. Moreover, we may be unable to efficiently integrate acquisitions, management attention and other resources may be diverted away from other potentially more profitable areas of our business and in some cases these acquisitions may turn out to be less compatible with our growth and operational strategy than originally anticipated. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs part of our business strategy, we also intend to continue collaborating with Hilton on timeshare development opportunities at new and existing hotel properties and explore growth opportunities along the Hilton brand spectrum, as well as expand our marketing partnerships and travel exchange partners. However, we may be unable to successfully enter into these arrangements on favorable terms or launch related products and services, or such products and services may not gain acceptance among our members or be profitable. The failure to develop and execute any such initiatives on a cost-effective basis could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPartnership or joint venture investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision-making authority, our reliance on partners\u2019 or co-venturers\u2019 financial condition, disputes between us and our partners or co-venturers and our obligation to guaranty certain obligations beyond the amount of our investments.\nWe have co-invested with third parties and we may in the future co-invest with other third parties through partnerships, joint ventures or other entities, acquiring non-controlling interests in, or sharing responsibility for managing the affairs, of a timeshare property, partnership, joint venture or other entity. Consequently, with respect to any such third-party arrangements, we would not be in a position to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding the property, partnership, joint venture or other entity, and may, under certain circumstances, be exposed to risks not present if a third party were not involved, including the possibility that partners or co-venturers might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contribution. In addition, we may be forced to make contributions to maintain the value of the property. Such investments may also have the potential risk of impasses on decisions, such as a sale, because neither we nor the partner or co-venturer may have full control over the partnership or joint venture. We and our respective partners or co-venturers may each have the right to trigger a buy-sell right or forced sale arrangement, which could cause us to sell our interest, or acquire our partners\u2019 or co-venturers\u2019 interest, or to sell the underlying asset, either on unfavorable terms or at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction. In addition, a sale or transfer by us to a third party of our interests in the partnership or joint venture may be subject to consent rights or rights of first refusal in favor of our partners or co-venturers, which would in each case restrict our ability to dispose of our interest in the partnership or joint venture. Any or all of these factors could adversely affect the value of our investment, our ability to exit, sell or dispose of our investment at times that are beneficial to us, or our financial commitment to maintaining our interest in the joint ventures.\nOur joint ventures may be subject to debt and the refinancing of such debt, and we may be required to provide certain guarantees or be responsible for the full amount of the debt, beyond the amount of our equity investment, in certain circumstances in the event of a default. Our joint venture partners may take actions that are inconsistent with the interests of the partnership or joint venture, or in violation of the financing arrangements and trigger our guaranty, which may expose us to substantial financial obligation and commitment that are beyond our ability to fund. In addition, partners or co-venturers may have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals and may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our policies or objectives. In some instances, partners or co-venturers may have competing interests in our markets that could create conflict of interest issues. Disputes between us and partners or co-venturers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers from focusing their time and effort on our business. Consequently, actions by or disputes with partners or co-venturers might result in subjecting assets owned by the partnership or joint venture, and to the extent of any guarantee our assets, to additional risk. In addition, we may, in certain circumstances, be liable for the actions of our third-party partners or co-venturers.\nOur dependence on development activities exposes us to project cost and completion risks.\nWe secure VOI inventory in part by developing new timeshare properties and new phases of existing timeshare properties. We have continued our construction activities as a critical source of developing new inventories that we sell and will continue to sell. Our ongoing involvement in the development of inventory presents a number of risks, including:\n\u2022weakness in the capital markets limiting our ability to raise capital for completion of projects or for development of future properties or products;\n\u2022construction costs and the costs of materials and supplies, to the extent they escalate faster than the pace at which we can increase the price of VOIs, adversely affecting our profits and margins;\n\u2022construction delays, supply chain delays, labor shortages, zoning and other local, state or federal governmental approvals, particularly in new geographic areas with which we are unfamiliar, cost overruns, lender financial defaults, or natural or man-made disasters, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, floods, fires, volcanic eruptions and oil spills, increasing overall project costs, affecting timing of project completion or resulting in project cancellations;\n\u2022any liability or alleged liability or resultant delays associated with latent defects in design or construction of projects we have developed or that we construct in the future adversely affecting our business, financial condition and reputation;\n\u2022failure by third-party contractors to perform for any reason, exposing us to operational, reputational and financial harm; and\n\u2022the existence of any title defects in properties we acquire.\nWe also source inventory from third-party developers that are exposed to such risks, and the occurrence of any of these risks with respect to those third parties could have a material adverse effect on our access to the inventory sourced from these developers. In addition, developing new VOIs to market and sell requires us to register such VOIs in applicable states, which necessitates the incurrence of additional time and cost, and in many jurisdictions, the exact date of any such registration approvals cannot be accurately predicted. Any significant delays in timeshare project registration approvals will materially adversely impact our sales activities and thereby negatively impact our revenue. See \u201cOur business is regulated under a wide variety of laws, regulations and policies, and failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our business.\u201d\nOur real estate investments subject us to numerous risks.\nWe are subject to the risks that generally relate to investments in and the development of real property. A variety of factors affect income from properties and real estate values, including laws and regulations, insurance, interest rate levels and the availability of financing. Our license agreement or other agreements with Hilton may require us to incur unexpected costs required to cause our properties to comply with applicable standards and policies. In recent years, our financial results have been positively impacted by a lower interest rate environment. However, when interest rates increase the cost of acquiring, developing, expanding or renovating real property increases, and real property values may decrease as the number of potential buyers decrease. Similarly, as financing becomes less available, it becomes more difficult both to acquire and develop real property. Many costs of real estate investments, such as real estate taxes, insurance premiums, maintenance costs and certain operating costs, are generally more fixed than variable, and as a result are not reduced even when a property is not fully sold or occupied. If any of these risks were realized, they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe manage a concentration of properties in particular geographic areas, which exposes our business to the effects of regional events and occurrences.\nOur properties are concentrated in certain geographic areas including Florida, Nevada, Hawaii, Europe, California, Virginia, and Arizona and are, therefore, particularly susceptible to adverse developments in those areas. These economic developments include regional economic downturns, significant increases in the number of our competitors\u2019 products in these markets, and potentially higher labor, real estate, tax or other costs in the geographic markets in which we are concentrated. In addition, the properties we manage are subject to the effects of adverse acts of natural or manmade disasters, including earthquakes, windstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes, typhoons, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, floods, drought, fires, oil spills and nuclear incidents. Extreme weather events and adverse weather\nconditions, including hurricanes, flooding and forest fires, that impact the areas in which our properties are concentrated may increase in frequency and severity as a result of climate change. Depending on the severity of these disasters, the damage could require closure of all or substantially all of these properties in one or more markets for a period of time while the necessary repairs and renovations, as applicable, are undertaken. In addition, we cannot guarantee that the amount of insurance maintained for these properties from time to time would entirely cover damages caused by any such event. Further, actual or threatened war, political conditions or civil unrest, violence or terrorist activities or threats and heightened travel security measures instituted in response to these events, could also interrupt or deter vacation plans to our key markets. As a result of this geographic concentration of properties, we face a greater risk of a negative effect on our revenues in the event these areas are more severely and more frequently affected by adverse economic and competitive conditions, extreme weather, manmade disasters, and political and civil unrest.\nOur current operations and future expansion outside of the United States make us susceptible to the risks of doing business internationally, which could lower our revenues, increase our costs, reduce our profits or disrupt our business.\nWe currently have timeshare properties located in the United States, Europe, Mexico, the Caribbean, Canada and Japan. We also market our products and services in the Asia Pacific region, primarily in Japan and South Korea. In addition, as part of our business strategy, we intend to continue the expansion of our operations in Japan, including by developing property there and selling VOIs at properties located in Japan, as well as explore further expansion opportunities in other countries located in the Asia Pacific region, Mexico and the Caribbean. Such activities may not be limited only to marketing efforts for existing international and U.S. properties and products in other countries, but may also include acquiring, developing, managing, marketing, offering and/or financing timeshare properties and VOI related products and services in such countries. Current and future international operations expose us to a number of additional challenges and risks that may not be inherent in operating solely in the U.S., including, for example, the following:\n\u2022rapid changes in governmental, economic or political policy;\n\u2022political or civil unrest, acts of terrorism or the threat of international boycotts or U.S. anti-boycott legislation;\n\u2022negative impact on governmental relationships between those countries in which we currently operate or have future expansion plans, on one hand, and the U.S., on the other hand, which may result in undesirable trade, travel or similar regulations, thereby negatively affecting the tourism industry generally, and the timeshare and leisure industry specifically;\n\u2022increases in anti-American sentiment and the identification of the Hilton brands as American brands;\n\u2022recessionary trends or economic instability in international markets;\n\u2022changes in foreign currency exchange rates or currency restructurings and hyperinflation or deflation in the countries in which we operate;\n\u2022the effect of disruptions caused by severe weather, natural disasters, outbreaks of disease or other events that make travel to a particular region less attractive or more difficult;\n\u2022the presence and acceptance of varying levels of business corruption in international markets and the effect of various anti-corruption and other laws;\n\u2022the imposition of restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds;\n\u2022the ability to comply with or effect of complying with complex and changing laws, regulations and policies of foreign governments that may affect investments or operations, including foreign ownership restrictions, import and export controls, tariffs, embargoes, increases in taxes paid and other changes in applicable tax laws;\n\u2022uncertain, unfamiliar and/or unpredictable regulatory environment that may adversely affect the acquisition, development, management, marketing, sales, financings, and related activities that affect the lodging, real estate, and travel industries, and, more specifically, to the timeshare industry, such as zoning laws, real estate development regulations, and consumer privacy;\n\u2022consequences of the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union, including new or different regulations;\n\u2022uncertainties as to local laws regarding, and enforcement of, contract and intellectual property rights;\n\u2022forced nationalization of resort properties by local, state or national governments;\n\u2022different social or cultural norms and practices that are not customary in the U.S.; and\n\u2022the difficulties involved in managing an organization doing business in different countries.\nThese and other factors may materially adversely affect our business generally, future expansion plans, revenues from international operations, and costs and profits, as well as our financial condition. Our experience operating internationally has been limited to certain markets and our acquisition of Diamond will expand our operations to a number of jurisdictions in which we have not previously operated. Expansion of our international operations into other countries and territories may result in greater inefficiencies in navigating the risks of operating internationally and could result in greater effects on our business than would be experienced by a company with greater international experience.\nSimilarly, we market our U.S. and international properties in Japan, have begun developing products and services in Japan, and intend to continue the expansion of our operations in Japan. The Japanese economy has in recent years experienced periods of fiscal and economic volatility, and we may be unable to properly predict the effect of such volatility, including the actions that may be taken by the Japanese government, in a way that fully mitigates the impact of such volatility on our marketing activities and businesses in Japan.\nIn Mexico, the developer of certain acquired Diamond resorts has agreed to requirements that would consider themselves Mexican nationals with respect to certain property. The developer also agrees to not invoke the protection of the governments in matters relating to the property. Generally, rules in Mexico limit ownership of land near Mexico\u2019s borders and beaches to Mexican citizens and companies, unless granted the right by the Mexican government. If the developer of the resorts in Mexico fails to comply with the agreement with the Mexican government, it would forfeit the land back to Mexico.\nWe rely on highly skilled personnel and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, hire qualified personnel, or maintain our corporate culture, we may not be able to grow effectively.\nOur performance largely depends on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Competition in our industry for qualified employees is intense, and certain of our competitors have directly targeted our employees. Our compensation arrangements may not always be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees, and we may need to increase compensation in order to maintain our workforce.\nThe loss of any members of our management team could adversely affect our strategic, member and guest relationships and impede our ability to execute our business strategies. If we cannot recruit, train, develop or retain sufficient numbers of talented employees, we could experience increased employee turnover, decreased member and guest satisfaction, low morale, inefficiency or internal control failures, which could materially reduce our profits. In addition, insufficient numbers of skilled employees at our properties could constrain our ability to maintain our current levels of business or successfully expand our business.\nWe and others in our industry are currently experiencing a labor shortage. Conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, concerns over safety and increased health and safety requirements, and actions taken by us in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as furloughs and layoffs, may increase the difficulty in hiring workers. Any continuing shortage could decrease our ability to operate our business and to achieve our strategic objectives and could place additional demands on and require overtime for our existing employees.\nWe believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation, creativity, and teamwork. As our organization grows, and we are required to implement more complex organizational management structures, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture and attract and retain employees. This could negatively affect our future success.\nThird-party reservation channels may negatively affect our bookings for room rental revenues.\nSome stays at the properties we manage are booked through third-party internet travel intermediaries, such as expedia.com, orbitz.com and booking.com, as well as lesser-known and/or newly emerging online travel service providers. As the percentage of internet bookings increases, these intermediaries may be able to obtain higher commissions, reduced room rates or other significant contract concessions from us. Moreover, some of these internet travel intermediaries are attempting to commoditize lodging, by increasing the importance of price and general indicators of quality (such as \u201cthree-star property\u201d) at the expense of brand identification. These intermediaries also generally employ aggressive marketing strategies, including expending significant resources for online and television advertising campaigns to drive consumers to their websites. Additionally, consumers can book stays at the properties we manage through other distribution channels, including travel agents, travel membership associations and meeting procurement firms. Over time, consumers may develop loyalties to these third-party reservation systems rather than to our booking channels. Although we expect to derive most of our business from traditional channels and our websites (and those of Hilton), our business and profitability could be adversely affected if customer loyalties change significantly, diverting bookings away from our distribution channels.\nChanges to estimates or projections used to assess the fair value of our assets, or operating results that are lower than our current estimates at certain locations, may cause us to incur impairment losses that could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur total assets include intangible assets with finite useful lives and long-lived assets, principally property and equipment and VOI inventory. We evaluate our intangible assets with finite useful lives and long-lived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Our evaluation of impairment requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions including projections of future results. After performing our evaluation for impairment, including an analysis to determine the recoverability of long-lived assets, we will record an impairment loss when the carrying value of the underlying asset, asset group or reporting unit exceeds its fair value. We carry our VOI inventory at the lower of cost or estimated fair value, less costs to sell. If the estimates or assumptions used in our evaluation of impairment or fair value change, we may be required to record impairment losses on certain of these assets. If these impairment losses are significant, our results of operations would be adversely affected.\nOur insurance policies may not cover all potential losses.\nWe maintain insurance coverage for liability, property, business interruption, cyber liability and other risks with respect to business operations. While we have comprehensive property and liability insurance policies with coverage features and insured limits that we believe are customary, market forces beyond our control may limit the scope of the insurance coverage we can obtain or our ability to obtain coverage at reasonable rates. The cost of our insurance may increase, and our coverage levels may decrease, which may affect our ability to maintain customary insurance coverage and deductibles at acceptable costs. There is a limit as well as various sub-limits on the amount of insurance proceeds we will receive in excess of applicable deductibles. If an insurable event occurs that affects more than one of our properties, the claims from each affected property may be considered together to determine whether the per occurrence limit, annual aggregate limit or sub-limits, depending on the type of claim, have been reached. If the limits or sub-limits are exceeded, each affected property may only receive a proportional share of the amount of insurance proceeds provided for under the policy. Further, certain types of losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as earthquakes, hurricanes and floods, war, terrorist acts, such as biological or chemical terrorism, political risks, some environmental hazards and/or natural or manmade disasters, may be outside the general coverage limits of our policy, subject to large deductibles, deemed uninsurable or too cost-prohibitive to justify insuring against. In addition, in the event of a substantial loss, the insurance coverage we carry may not be sufficient to pay the full market value or replacement cost of the affected resort or in some cases may not provide a recovery for any part of a loss. As a result, we could lose some or all the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future marketing, sales or revenue opportunities from the property. Further, we could remain obligated under guarantees or other financial obligations related to the property despite the loss of product inventory, and our members could be required to contribute toward deductibles to help cover losses.\nRisks Related to the Sale of VOIs\nA decline in developed or acquired VOI inventory or our failure to enter into and maintain fee-for-service agreements may have an adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nIn addition to VOI supply that we develop or acquire, we source VOIs through fee-for-service agreements with third-party developers. If we fail to develop timeshare properties, acquire inventory or are unsuccessful in entering into new agreements with third-party developers, we may experience a decline in VOI supply, which could result in a decrease in our revenues. Approximately 51 percent of our contract sales were from capital-efficient sources for the year ended December 31, 2021. As part of our strategy to optimize our sales mix of capital-efficient inventory, we will continue to acquire inventory and enter into additional fee-for-service agreements to source inventory. These arrangements may expose us to additional risk as we will not control development activities or timing of development completion. If third parties with whom we enter into agreements are not able to fulfill their obligations to us, the inventory we expect to acquire or market and sell on their behalf may not be available on time or at all, or may not otherwise be within agreed-upon specifications, including the specifications that we must meet in order to use Hilton\u2019s trademarks at such properties. If our counterparties do not perform as expected and we do not have access to the expected inventory or obtain access to inventory from alternative sources on a timely basis, our ability to achieve sales goals may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, a decline in VOI supply could result in a decrease of financing revenues that are generated by VOI purchases and fee and rental revenues that are generated by our resort and Club management services.\nOur ability to source VOI inventory and finance VOI sales may be impaired if we or the third-party developers with whom we do business are unable to access capital when necessary.\nThe availability of funds for new investments, primarily developing, acquiring or repurchasing VOI inventory, depends in part on liquidity factors and capital markets over which we can exert little, if any, control. Instability in the financial markets and any resulting contraction of available liquidity and leverage could constrain the capital markets for investments in timeshare products. In addition, we intend to access the securitization markets to securitize our timeshare financing receivables. Any future deterioration in the financial markets could preclude, limit, delay or increase the cost to us of future securitizations. Instability in the financial markets could also affect the timing and volume of any securitizations we undertake, as well as the financial terms of such securitizations. Any indebtedness we incur, including indebtedness under these facilities, may adversely affect our ability to obtain any additional financing necessary to develop or acquire additional VOI inventory, to make other investments in our business, or to repurchase VOIs on the secondary market. Furthermore, volatility in the financial markets, due to tightening of underwriting standards by lenders and credit rating agencies, among other things, could result in less availability of credit and increased costs for what is available. As a result, we may not be able to obtain financing on attractive terms or at all. If our overall cost of borrowing increases, the increased costs would likely reduce future cash flow available for distribution, affecting our growth and development plans.\nWe also require the issuance of surety bonds in connection with our real estate development and VOI sales activity. The availability, terms and conditions and pricing of our bonding capacity is dependent on, among other things, continued financial strength and stability of the insurance company affiliates providing the bonding capacity, general availability of such capacity, and our corporate credit rating. If bonding capacity is unavailable, or alternatively, if the terms and conditions and pricing of such bonding capacity are unacceptable to us, our business could be negatively affected.\nWe have and will continue to enter into fee-for-service agreements with third-party developers to source inventory. These agreements enable us to generate fees from the marketing and sales services we provide, Club memberships and from the management of the timeshare properties without requiring us to fund acquisition and construction costs. If these developers are not able to obtain or maintain financing necessary for their operations, we may not be able to enter into these arrangements, which would limit opportunities for growth and reduce our revenues.\nThe sale of VOIs in the secondary market by existing members could cause our sales revenues and profits to decline.\nExisting members have offered, and are expected to continue to offer, their VOIs for sale on the secondary market. The sale of VOIs has been made easier by recent development of virtual marketplaces assisting members with the sale of their VOIs. The prices at which these intervals are sold are typically less than the prices at which we would sell the intervals. As a result, these sales create additional pricing pressure on our sale of VOIs, which could cause our sales revenues and profits to decline. In addition, if the secondary market for VOIs becomes more organized or financing for such resales becomes more available, our ability to sell VOIs could be adversely affected and/or the resulting availability of VOIs (particularly where the VOIs are available for sale at lower prices than the prices at which we would sell them) could adversely affect our sales revenues. Further, unlawful or deceptive third-party VOI resale or vacation package sales schemes could damage the reputation of the industry, our reputation and brand value, or affect our ability to collect management fees, which may adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nDevelopment of a strong secondary market may also cause a decline in the volume of VOI inventory that we are able to repurchase, which could adversely affect our development margin, as we utilize this low-cost inventory source to supplement our inventory needs and help manage our cost of vacation ownership products.\nWe have limited underwriting standards due to the real-time nature of industry sales practices, and do not include traditional ability-to-pay factors such as income verification which may affect loan default rates. If purchasers default on the loans that we provide to finance their VOI purchases, our revenues, cash flows and profits could be reduced.\nWe originate loans for purchasers of our VOIs who qualify according to our credit criteria. Our underwriting standards generally employ FICO\u00ae score-based standards, down payment ratios, and borrowing history, but due to the real-time nature of industry sales practices, do not include certain traditional ability-to-pay factors, such as income verification.\nProviding secured financing to some purchasers of VOIs subjects us to the risk of purchaser default. As of December 31, 2021, our consumer loan portfolio had a balance of approximately $2.4 billion and experienced default rates of 8.93 percent, 6.34 percent and 5.14 percent for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. If a purchaser defaults under the financing that we provide, we could be forced to write off the loan and reclaim ownership of the VOI. We may be unable to resell the property in a timely manner or at a price sufficient to allow us to recover written-off loan balances, or at all. Also, if a purchaser of a VOI defaults on the related loan during the early part of the amortization period, we may not have recovered the marketing, selling and general and administrative costs associated with the sale of that VOI. If we are unable to recover any of the principal amount of the loan from a defaulting purchaser, or if the allowances for losses from such defaults are inadequate, our revenues and profits could be reduced.\nIf default rates increase beyond current projections and result in higher than expected foreclosure activity, our results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, the transactions in which we have securitized timeshare financing receivables in the capital markets contain certain portfolio performance requirements related to default, delinquency and recovery rates, which, if not met, would result in loss or disruption of cash flow until portfolio performance sufficiently improves to satisfy the requirements.\nIf the default rates or other credit metrics underlying our timeshare financing receivables deteriorate, our timeshare financing receivable securitization program could be adversely affected.\nOur timeshare financing receivable securitization program could be adversely affected if any pool of timeshare financing receivables fails to meet certain performance ratios, which could occur if the default rate or other credit metrics of the underlying timeshare financing receivables deteriorate. In addition, if we offer timeshare financings to our customers with terms longer than those generally offered in the industry, we may not be able to securitize those timeshare financing receivables. Our ability to sell securities backed by our timeshare financing receivables depends on the continued ability and willingness of capital market participants to invest in such securities. Asset-backed securities issued in our timeshare financing receivable securitization program could be downgraded by credit agencies in the future. If a downgrade occurs, our ability to complete other securitization transactions on acceptable terms or at all could be jeopardized, and we could be forced to rely on other potentially more expensive and less attractive funding sources, to the extent available. Similarly, if other operators of vacation ownership products were to experience significant financial difficulties, or if the timeshare industry as a whole were to contract, we could experience difficulty in securing funding on acceptable terms. The occurrence of any of the foregoing would decrease our profitability and might require us to adjust our business operations, including by reducing or suspending our provision of financing to purchasers of VOIs. Sales of VOIs may decline if we reduce or suspend the provision of financing to purchasers, which may adversely affect our cash flows, revenues and profits.\nThe expiration, termination or renegotiation of our management agreements could adversely affect our cash flows, revenues and profits.\nWe enter into management agreements with the HOAs for the timeshare resorts developed/acquired by us or by third parties with whom we have entered into fee-for-service agreements. Our management agreements generally provide for a cost-plus management fee equal to 10 percent to 15 percent of the costs to operate the applicable resort. We also receive revenues that represent reimbursement for the costs incurred to perform our services, principally related to personnel providing on-site services. The original term of our management agreements is typically governed by state timeshare laws, and ranges from three to five years, and many of these agreements renew automatically for one- to three-year periods, unless either party provides advance notice of termination before the expiration of the term. Any of these agreements may expire at the end of its then-current term (following notice by a party of non-renewal) or be terminated, or the contract terms may be renegotiated in a manner adverse to us. If a management agreement is terminated or not renewed on favorable terms, our cash flows, revenues and profits could be adversely affected.\nIncreased activity by third-party exit companies' owners may adversely impact our business.\nThe acquired Diamond business has been significantly targeted by organized activities of third parties that actively pursue timeshare owners claiming to provide timeshare interest transfers and/or \u201cexit\u201d services. Any increases in the level of participation by timeshare owners in response to such overtures and/or delinquencies or defaults with respect to the timeshare loans owed by such owners may disrupt our business and affect cash flow from collections on the timeshare loans. In addition, exit companies may target HGV owners to a greater extent than they already do in light of the Diamond Acquisition.\nDisagreements with VOI owners, HOAs and other third parties may result in litigation and/or loss of management contracts.\nThe nature of our responsibilities in managing timeshare properties may from time to time give rise to disagreements with VOI owners and HOAs. To develop and maintain positive relations with current and potential VOI owners and HOAs, we seek to resolve any disagreements, but may not always be able to do so. Failure to resolve such disagreements may result in litigation. Further, disagreements with HOAs could also result in the loss of management contracts, a significant loss of which could negatively affect our profits or limit our ability to operate our business, and our ongoing ability to generate sales from our existing member base may be adversely affected.\nIn the normal course of our business, we are involved in various legal proceedings and in the future we could become the subject of claims by current or former members, VOI owners, HOAs, persons to whom we market our products, third-party developers, guests who use our properties, our employees or contractors, our investors or regulators. The outcome of these proceedings cannot be predicted. If any such litigation results in a significant adverse judgment, settlement, or court order, we could suffer significant losses, our profits could be reduced, our reputation could be harmed and our future ability to operate our business could be constrained.\nFailure of HOA boards to levy sufficient fees, or the failure of members to pay those fees, could lead to inadequate funds to maintain or improve the properties we manage.\nOwners of our VOIs and those we sell on behalf of third-party developers must pay maintenance fees levied by HOA boards, which include reserve amounts for capital replacements and refurbishments. These maintenance fees are used to maintain and refurbish the timeshare properties and to keep the properties in compliance with applicable Hilton standards and policies. If HOA boards do not levy sufficient maintenance fees, including capital reserves required by applicable law, or fail to manage their reserves appropriately, or if members do not pay their maintenance fees, the timeshare properties could fall into disrepair and fail to comply with applicable standards and policies, and/or state regulators could impose requirements, obligations and penalties. A decline in the quality or standards of the resorts we manage would negatively affect our ability to attract new members and maintain member satisfaction. In addition, if a resort fails to comply with applicable standards and policies because maintenance fees are not paid or otherwise, Hilton could terminate our rights under the license agreement to use its trademarks at the non-compliant resort, which could result in the loss of management fees, and could decrease member satisfaction and impair our ability to market and sell our products at the non-compliant locations.\nIf maintenance fees at our resorts are required to be increased, our product could become less attractive and our business could be harmed.\nThe maintenance fees that are levied by HOA boards on VOI owners may increase as the costs to maintain and refurbish the timeshare properties and to keep the properties in compliance with Hilton brand standards increase. Increased maintenance fees could make our products less desirable, which could have a negative effect on VOI sales. Further, if our maintenance fees increase substantially year over year or are not competitive with other VOI providers, we may not be able to attract new members or retain existing members.\nRisks Related to Technology and Cybersecurity\nA failure to keep pace with developments in technology could impair our operations, competitive position or reputation.\nOur business model and competitive conditions in the timeshare industry demand the use of sophisticated technology and systems, including those used for our marketing, sales, reservation, inventory management and property management systems, and technologies we make available to our members and more generally to support our business. In particular, an increasing number of potential customers select products based on the providers\u2019 technology and ease of interfacing with the provider. We must refine, update and/or replace these technologies and systems with more advanced systems on a regular basis. If we cannot do so as quickly as our competitors or within budgeted costs and time frames, our business could suffer. We also may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from any new technology or system, and a failure to do so could result in higher than anticipated costs or could harm our operating results.\nSocial media influences how consumers search for vacation information and make decisions to purchase vacation-related products and services. Lack of awareness or understanding of and the failure to effectively manage, and the costs associated with our management of social media content regarding our products and services could have a material adverse effect on VOI sales, revenues and our operating results.\nSocial media has become an increasingly influential aspect of tourism, changing the way consumers search, evaluate, rank and purchase vacation products and services. In particular, social media plays a role in the pre-vacation phase, when consumers employ social media in the planning, information search, and the decision-making stages. Providers are no longer the primary spokesperson regarding the quality of their brands and products. Online reviews about vacation resorts play an increasing role in helping today\u2019s consumers evaluate and make vacation decisions by providing positive and negative reviews and indirect customer-to-customer communication. Consumers may find traveler-generated content more trustworthy than information on provider websites and advertising. Vacation decisions are influenced by both negative customer reviews, and by the lack of positive reviews.\nThe proliferation and global reach of social media continue to expand rapidly and could cause us to suffer reputational harm. The continuing evolution of social media presents new challenges and requires us to keep pace with new developments, technology and trends. Negative posts or comments about us, sales practices, the properties we manage, the Hilton brands, or the timeshare industry generally, on any social networking or user-generated review website, including travel and/or vacation property websites, could affect consumer opinions of us and our products; and we cannot guarantee that we will timely or adequately redress such instances. The failure to appreciate the importance of content on social media or failing to take action that generates positive content, minimizes negative content, and addresses areas of nonexistent content, could have a material adverse effect on VOI sales, revenues and our operating results. In addition, we may be required to devote significant resources to social media management programs, which could result in increased costs to us.\nOur increasing reliance on information technology and other systems subjects us to risks associated with cyber-security. Cyber-attacks or our failure to maintain the security and integrity of company, employee, associate, customer or third-party data could have a disruptive effect on our business and adversely affect our reputation and financial performance.\nWe rely heavily on computer, Internet-based and mobile information and communications systems operated by us or our service providers to collect, process, transmit and retain large volumes of customer data, including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information, reservation information and mailing lists, as well as personally identifiable information of our employees. There has been an increase in the number and sophistication of\ncriminal cyber-security attacks against companies where customer and other sensitive information has been compromised. Our information systems and records, including those we maintain with our service providers, have been, and likely will continue to be, subject to such cyber-attacks, which include efforts to hack or breach security measures in order to obtain or misuse information, phishing attempts, viruses or other malicious codes, \u201cransomware\u201d or other malware. In addition, increasingly complex systems and software are subject to failure, operator error or malfeasance, or inadvertent releases of data that may materially impact our information systems and records. For instance, security breaches could result in the dissemination of member and guest credit card information, which could lead to affected members and guests experiencing fraudulent charges. To date, we have seen no material impact on our business or operations from these attacks or events. However, the ever-evolving threats mean we and our third-party service providers and vendors must continually evaluate and adapt our respective systems and processes and overall security environment, as well as those of any companies we may acquire. There is no guarantee that these measures will be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches, system compromises or misuses of data.\nThe integrity and protection of customer and employee data is critical to us. We could make faulty decisions if that data is inaccurate or incomplete. Customers and employees also have a high expectation that we and our service providers will adequately protect their personal information. A significant theft, loss, loss of access to, or fraudulent use of customer, employee, or company data could adversely impact our reputation, and could result in significant remedial and other expenses, fines, and/or litigation. Breaches in the security of our information systems or those of our service providers or other disruptions in data services could lead to an interruption in the operation of our systems or require us to consider changes to our customer data or payment systems, resulting in operational inefficiencies, additional expense and a loss of profits.\nOur collection and use of customer information are governed by extensive and evolving privacy laws and regulations that are constantly evolving and may differ significantly depending on jurisdiction. Compliance with these laws and regulations involves significant costs, which may increase in the future and which may negatively impact our ability to provide services to our customers, and a failure by us or our service providers to comply with privacy regulations may subject us to significant remedial and other expenses, fines, or litigation, as well as restrictions on our use or transfer of data.\nMany jurisdictions have enacted or are enacting laws requiring companies to notify regulators or individuals of data security incidents involving certain types of personal data. These mandatory disclosures regarding security incidents often lead to widespread negative publicity, and the risk of reputational harm may be magnified and/or distorted through the rapid dissemination of information over the internet, including through news articles, blogs, chat rooms, and social media sites. Any security incident, whether actual or perceived, could harm our reputation, erode customer confidence in the effectiveness of our data security measures, negatively impact our ability to attract or retain customers, or subject us to third-party lawsuits, regulatory fines or other action or liability, which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur business could be subject to stricter obligations and, greater fines and private causes of action under the enactment of data privacy laws, including but not limited to, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act. Our systems and the systems operated by our service providers may be unable to satisfy changing regulatory requirements and customer and employee expectations and/or may require significant additional investments or time to do so.\nThe steps we take to deter and mitigate risks related to cyber-security may not provide the intended level of protection. In particular, it may be difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage caused thereby. We may be required to expend significant additional resources in the future to modify and enhance our protective measures. Although we carry cyber/privacy liability insurance that is designed to protect us against certain losses related to cyber-security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in connection with cyber-attacks, security breaches, and other related breaches. In addition, the third party service providers on which we rely face cyber-security risks, some of which may be different than the risks we face, and we do not directly control any of such service providers\u2019 information security operations, including the efforts that they may take to mitigate risks or the level of cyber/privacy liability insurance that they may carry.\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Requirements\nOur business is regulated under a wide variety of laws, regulations and policies in the United States and abroad, and failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our business.\nOur business is subject to extensive regulation, and any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our real estate development activities, for example, are subject to laws and regulations typically applicable to real estate development, subdivision and construction activities, such as laws relating to zoning, entitlement, permitting, land use restrictions, environmental regulation, title transfers, title insurance, taxation and eminent domain. Failure to comply with the laws could result in legal liability or result in substantial costs related to environmental or other remediation. Laws in some jurisdictions also impose liability on property developers for construction defects discovered or repairs made by future owners of property developed by the developer. In addition, the sales of VOIs must be registered with governmental authorities in most jurisdictions in which we do business. The preparation of VOI registrations requires time and cost, and in many jurisdictions the exact date of registration approval cannot be accurately predicted. Various laws also govern our lending activities and our resort management activities, including the laws described in \u201cBusiness-Government Regulation.\u201d\nA number of laws govern our marketing and sales activities, such as timeshare and land sales acts, fair housing statutes, anti-fraud laws, sweepstakes laws, real estate licensing laws, telemarketing laws, home solicitation sales laws, tour operator laws, seller of travel laws, securities laws, consumer privacy laws and consumer protection laws. In addition, laws in many jurisdictions in which we sell VOIs grant the purchaser of a VOI the right to cancel a purchase contract during a specified rescission period.\nIn recent years, telemarketing legislation has significantly increased the costs associated with telemarketing. We have implemented procedures that we believe will help reduce the possibility of violating such laws, however, such procedures may not be effective in ensuring regulatory compliance. In addition, because we are now an independent company from Hilton, it may be more difficult for us to utilize customer information we obtain from Hilton in the future for marketing purposes.\nUnder the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Accessibility Guidelines promulgated thereunder (collectively, the \u201cADA\u201d), all public accommodations must meet various federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Compliance with ADA\u2019s requirements could require removal of access barriers, and non-compliance could result in the U.S. government imposing fines or in private litigants winning damages. Our properties also are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. Furthermore, various laws govern our resort management activities, including laws and regulations regarding community association management, public lodging, food and beverage services, liquor licensing, labor, employment, health care, health and safety, accessibility, discrimination, immigration, gaming and the environment (including climate change).\nOur lending activities are also subject to a number of laws and regulations, including laws and regulations related to consumer loans, retail installment contracts, mortgage lending, fair debt collection and credit reporting practices, consumer collection practices, contacting debtors by telephone, mortgage disclosure, lender licenses and money laundering.\nWe may not be successful in maintaining compliance with all laws, regulations and policies to which we are currently subject, and such compliance is expensive and time consuming. We do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements, including regulatory requirements in new geographic areas into which we expand would require significant unanticipated expenditures that would affect our cash flow and results of operations. Failure to comply with current or future applicable laws, regulations and policies could have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, if we do not comply with applicable laws, regulations and policies, governmental authorities in the jurisdictions where the violations occurred may revoke or refuse to renew licenses or registrations necessary to operate our business. Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and policies could also render sales contracts for our products void or voidable, subject us to fines or other sanctions, and increase our exposure to litigation.\nChanges in privacy law could adversely affect our ability to market our products effectively.\nWe rely on a variety of direct marketing techniques, including telemarketing, email and social media marketing and postal mailings, and we are subject to various laws and regulations in the United States and internationally that govern marketing and advertising practices. Adoption of new state or federal laws regulating marketing and solicitation, or international data protection laws that govern these activities, or changes to existing laws, such as the Telemarketing Sales Rule, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, and the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, could adversely affect current or planned marketing activities and cause us to change our marketing strategy. If this occurs, we may not be able to develop adequate alternative marketing strategies, which could affect the amount and timing of our VOI sales. We also obtain access to potential members and guests from travel service providers or other companies, including Hilton; and we market to some individuals on these lists directly or through other companies\u2019 marketing materials. If access to these lists were prohibited or otherwise restricted, including access to Hilton Honors loyalty program member information, our ability to access potential members and guests and introduce them to our products could be significantly impaired. Additionally, because our relationship with Hilton has changed, it may be more difficult for us to utilize customer information we obtain from Hilton in the future.\nUnited States or foreign environmental laws and regulations may cause us to incur substantial costs or subject us to potential liabilities.\nWe are subject to certain compliance costs and potential liabilities under various U.S. federal, state and local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern actions including air emissions, the use, storage and disposal of hazardous and toxic substances, and wastewater disposal. Our failure to comply with such laws, including any required permits or licenses, could result in substantial fines, penalties, litigation or possible revocation of our authority to conduct some of our operations. We could also be liable under such laws for the costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at our currently or formerly owned real property or at third-party locations in connection with our waste disposal operations, regardless of whether or not we knew of, or caused, the presence or release of such substances. From time to time, we may be required to remediate such substances or remove, abate or manage asbestos, mold, radon gas, lead or other hazardous conditions at our properties. The presence or release of such toxic or hazardous substances could result in third-party claims for personal injury, property or natural resource damages, business interruption or other losses. Such claims and the need to investigate, remediate or otherwise address hazardous, toxic or unsafe conditions could adversely affect our operations, the value of any affected real property, or our ability to sell, lease or assign our rights in any such property, or could otherwise harm our business or reputation. Environmental, health and safety requirements have also become increasingly stringent, and our costs may increase as a result.\nSome U.S. states and various countries are considering or have undertaken actions to regulate and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. New or revised laws and regulations, or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, such as those related to climate change, could affect the operation of the properties we manage or result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on us. The cost of such legislation, regulation or new interpretations would depend upon the specific requirements enacted and cannot be determined at this time. In addition, failure or perception of failure to achieve our goals with respect to reducing our impact on the environment or perception of a failure to act responsibly with respect to the environment or to effectively respond to regulatory requirements concerning climate change could lead to adverse publicity, resulting in an adverse effect on our business or damage to our reputation.\nChanges in U.S. federal, state and local or foreign tax law, interpretations of existing tax law, or adverse determinations by tax authorities, could increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to taxation at the federal, state and local levels in the United States and various other countries and jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in jurisdictions with differing tax rates, changes in statutory rates and other legislative changes, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in determinations regarding the jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax. From time to time, the U.S. federal, state and local and foreign governments make substantive changes to tax rules and their application, which could result in materially higher corporate taxes than would be incurred under existing tax law and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Changes in the non-income tax rates to which we are subject could also have an adverse effect on the maintenance fees charged to our members, which could result in materially lower sales and higher operating costs.\nThere can be no assurance that changes in tax laws or regulations, both within the U.S. and the other jurisdictions in which we operate, will not materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate, tax payments, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, changes in tax laws and regulations that impact our customers and counterparties, or the economy generally may also impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nTax laws and regulations are complex and subject to varying interpretations and any significant failure to comply with applicable tax laws and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions could give rise to substantial penalties and liabilities. Any changes in enacted tax laws, rules or regulatory or judicial interpretations or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could materially and adversely impact our effective tax rate, tax payments, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we are subject to ongoing and periodic tax audits and disputes in U.S. federal and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. An unfavorable outcome from any tax audit could result in higher tax costs, penalties and interest, and could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nFailure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our international operations may increase costs, reduce profits, limit growth or subject us to broader liability.\nOur business operations in countries outside the United States are subject to a number of laws and regulations, including restrictions imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), as well as trade sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d). The FCPA is intended to prohibit bribery of foreign officials and requires us to keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect our transactions. OFAC administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign states, organizations and individuals. Although we have policies in place designed to comply with applicable sanctions, rules and regulations, it is possible that the timeshare properties we own or manage in the countries and territories in which we operate may provide services to or receive funds from persons subject to sanctions. In addition, some of our operations may be subject to the laws and regulations of non-U.S. jurisdictions, including the U.K.\u2019s Bribery Act of 2010, which contains significant prohibitions on bribery and other corrupt business activities, and other local anti-corruption laws in the countries and territories in which we conduct operations.\nIf we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be exposed to claims for damages, financial penalties, reputational harm and incarceration of employees or restrictions on our operation or ownership of timeshare and other properties, products or services, including the termination of ownership and management rights. In addition, in certain circumstances, the actions of parties affiliated with us (including Hilton, third-party developers, and our and their respective employees and agents) may expose us to liability under the FCPA, U.S. sanctions or other laws. These restrictions could increase costs of operations, reduce profits or cause us to forgo development opportunities that would otherwise support growth.\nUnder the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (\u201cITRSHRA\u201d), we are required to report whether we or any of our \u201caffiliates\u201d knowingly engaged in certain specified activities during a period covered by one of our Annual Reports on Form 10-K or Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. We may engage in specified dealings or transactions involving Iran or other individuals and entities targeted by certain OFAC sanctions that would require disclosure pursuant to Section 219 of ITRSHRA. In addition, because the SEC defines the term \u201caffiliate\u201d broadly, it includes any entity controlled by us as well as any person or entity that controls us or is under common control with us. Disclosure of such activities, even if such activities are permissible under applicable law, and any sanctions imposed on us or our affiliates as a result of these activities could harm our reputation and the Hilton brands we use and have a negative effect on our results of operations.\nThe European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d) imposes significant obligations to businesses that sell products or services to EU customers or otherwise control or process personal data of EU residents. Complying with the GDPR could increase our compliance cost, or adversely impact the marketing of our products and services to customers in the EU and our overall business. In addition, the GDPR imposes fines and penalties for noncompliance, including fines of up to 4 percent of annual worldwide revenue. If we fail to comply with the requirements of the GDPR, we could face significant administrative and monetary sanctions, which could materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges to accounting rules or regulations may adversely affect our reported financial condition and results of operations.\nNew accounting rules or regulations and varying interpretations of existing accounting rules or regulations have occurred and may occur in the future. A change in accounting rules or regulations may require retrospective application and affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective, and future changes to accounting rules or regulations may adversely affect our reported financial condition and results of operations. See Notes 1: Organization and Basis of Presentation and 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of accounting standards issued but not yet adopted.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur substantial indebtedness and other contractual obligations could adversely affect our financial condition, our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, our ability to operate our business, our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and our ability to pay our debts, and could divert our cash flow from operations for debt payments.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our total indebtedness was approximately $4.2 billion. We significantly increased our level of indebtedness in connection with financing the Diamond Acquisition. We closed an unregistered offering of $850 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.000 percent senior notes due 2029 and an unregistered offering of $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.875 percent senior notes due 2031. In addition, we borrowed term loans in an initial aggregate principal amount of $1.3 billion under a new senior secured term loan credit facility to repay certain indebtedness of HGV and Diamond in connection with the closing of the Diamond Acquisition. Finally, we assumed several of Diamond\u2019s revolving facilities that are secured by timeshare loan receivables. Our substantial debt and other contractual obligations could have important consequences, including:\n\u2022requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures, dividends to stockholders and to pursue future business opportunities;\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry or competitive developments;\n\u2022exposing us to increased interest expense, as our degree of leverage may cause the interest rates of any future indebtedness (whether fixed or floating rate interest) to be higher than they would be otherwise;\n\u2022exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our indebtedness is at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default that accelerates our obligation to repay indebtedness;\n\u2022restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, satisfaction of debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who may be better positioned to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting.\nIn addition, our credit ratings will impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and, accordingly, our cost of capital. Our ratings will reflect each rating organization\u2019s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations on a combined basis with Diamond. Downgrades in our ratings could adversely affect our businesses, cash flows, financial condition, operating results and share and debt prices, as well as our obligations with respect to our capital efficient inventory acquisitions.\nFor additional discussion on our indebtedness, see \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Financing Activities,\u201d and Note 15: Debt & Non-recourse Debt in our audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCertain of our debt agreements and instruments impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, our restricted subsidiaries and the guarantors of our indebtedness, which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities.\nThe debt agreements and instruments that govern our outstanding indebtedness impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, certain of our subsidiaries and guarantors of our indebtedness. These restrictions limit our ability and/or the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to, among other things:\n\u2022incur or guarantee additional debt or issue disqualified stock or preferred stock;\n\u2022pay dividends (including to us) and make other distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, capital stock;\n\u2022make certain investments;\n\u2022incur certain liens;\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022merge or consolidate;\n\u2022enter into agreements that restrict the ability of restricted subsidiaries to make dividends or other payments to us;\n\u2022designate restricted subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and\n\u2022transfer or sell assets.\nIn addition, our credit agreement related to our senior secured credit facilities contains affirmative covenants that will require us to be in compliance with certain leverage and financial ratios.\nAs a result of these restrictions, we are limited as to how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. The terms of any other future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants. We may not be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and, if we fail to do so, we may not be able to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants.\nOur failure to comply with the restrictive covenants described above, as well as other terms of our other indebtedness and/or the terms of any future indebtedness from time to time, could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in our being required to repay these borrowings before their due date. If we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or are unable to refinance these borrowings, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our indebtedness service obligations to increase significantly.\nInterest rates may increase in the future. As a result, interest rates on our revolving credit facility or other variable rate debt offerings could be higher or lower than current levels. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $1,873 million of variable rate debt, representing 43 percent of our total debt. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase, even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, would correspondingly decrease.\nOn July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit London Interbank Offering Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) rates after 2021. The administrator of LIBOR ceased the publication of all non-U.S. dollar LIBOR and the one-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR settings\nimmediately following the LIBOR publication on December 31, 2021, with the publication of the remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR settings being discontinued on June 30, 2023. It is expected that a transition away from the widespread use of LIBOR to alternative rates will occur over the course of the next several years. If LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate our revolving credit facility, which utilizes LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate, to replace LIBOR with the new standard that is established. There is currently no definitive information regarding the future utilization of LIBOR or of any particular replacement rate. As such, the potential effect of any such event on our cost of capital and net investment income cannot yet be determined.\nServicing our indebtedness requires a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors, some of which are not within our control.\nOur ability to make payments on our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. Our ability to generate cash depends on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. In particular, compliance with state and local laws applicable to our business, including those relating to deeds, title transfers and certain other regulations applicable to sales of VOIs, may at times delay or hinder our ability to access cash flows generated by our VOI sales. If we are unable to generate and access sufficient cash flow to service our debt and meet our other commitments, we may need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, sell material assets or operations or raise additional debt or equity capital. We may not be able to effect any of these actions on a timely basis, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, and these actions may not be sufficient to meet our capital requirements. In addition, the terms of our existing or future debt arrangements may restrict us from effecting any of these alternatives.\nOur failure to comply with the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness could result in an event of default that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and our financial condition.\nIf there were an event of default under any of the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness, the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately. We cannot assure you that our assets or cash flows would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default. Further, if we are unable to repay, refinance or restructure our indebtedness under our secured debt, the holders of such debt could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness. In addition, any event of default or declaration of acceleration under one debt instrument could also result in an event of default under one or more of our other debt instruments. Any such default could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and our financial condition.\nRepayment of our debt is dependent on cash flow generated by our subsidiaries, which may be subject to limitations beyond our control.\nOur subsidiaries own a substantial portion of our assets and conduct a substantial portion of our operations. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness is dependent, to a significant extent, on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise.\nOur subsidiaries generally do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on our indebtedness or to make funds available to us for that purpose. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. While limitations on our subsidiaries restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to us, these limitations are subject to certain qualifications and exceptions. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries are party to debt agreements that contain restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to us and may in the future enter into agreements that include additional contractual restrictions on their ability to make any such payments to us.\nIn the event that we are unable to receive distributions from subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness.\nDespite our current level of indebtedness, we may be able to incur substantially more debt and enter into other transactions, which could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above.\nWe may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness, including secured debt, in the future. Although the agreements that govern substantially all of our indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional\nindebtedness and entering into certain types of other transactions, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions. Additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. These restrictions also do not prevent us from incurring obligations, such as trade payables, that do not constitute indebtedness as defined under our debt instruments. To the extent new debt is added to our current debt levels, the substantial leverage risks described in the preceding six risk factors would increase.\nRisks Related to the 2017 Spin-Off From Hilton\nWe may be responsible for U.S. federal income tax liabilities that relate to the distribution.\nThe completion of the spin-off was conditioned upon the absence of any withdrawal, invalidation or modification of the ruling (\u201cIRS Ruling\u201d) Hilton received from the IRS regarding certain U.S. federal income tax aspects of the spin-off in an adverse manner prior to the effective time of the spin-off. Although the IRS Ruling generally is binding on the IRS, the continued validity of the IRS Ruling is based upon and subject to the accuracy of factual statements and representations made to the IRS by Hilton.\nIn addition, the spin-off was conditioned on the receipt of an opinion of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, Hilton\u2019s tax counsel (\u201cspin-off Tax Counsel\u201d) to the effect that the distributions of our and Park common stock would qualify as tax-free distributions under Section 355 of the Code. An opinion of spin-off Tax Counsel is not binding on the IRS. Accordingly, the IRS may reach conclusions with respect to the spin-off that are different from the conclusions reached in the opinion. The opinion was based on certain factual statements and representations, which, if incomplete or untrue in any material respect, could alter spin-off Tax Counsel\u2019s conclusions.\nWe are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would cause any such factual statements or representations in the IRS Ruling or the opinion of spin-off Tax Counsel to be incomplete or untrue or cause the facts on which the IRS Ruling and legal opinion are based to be materially different from the facts at the time of the spin-off.\nIf all or a portion of the spin-off does not qualify as a tax-free transaction for any reason, Hilton may recognize a substantial gain attributable to the timeshare business for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such case, under U.S. Treasury regulations, each member of the Hilton consolidated group at the time of the spin-off (including us and our subsidiaries) would be jointly and severally liable for the resulting entire amount of any U.S. federal income tax liability. Additionally, if the distribution of our common stock and/or the distribution of Park common stock do not qualify as tax-free under Section 355 of the Code, Hilton stockholders will be treated as having received a taxable dividend to the extent of Hilton\u2019s current and accumulated earnings and profits, would have a tax-free basis recovery up to the amount of their tax basis in their shares, and would have taxable gain from the sale or exchange of the shares to the extent of any excess.\nThe spin-off and related transactions may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal distribution requirements.\nThe spin-off could be challenged under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws. An unpaid creditor or an entity vested with the power of such creditor (such as a trustee or debtor-in-possession in a bankruptcy) could claim that Hilton did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value in the spin-off, and that the spin-off left Hilton insolvent or with unreasonably small capital or that Hilton intended or believed it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature. If a court were to agree with such a plaintiff, then such court could void the spin-off as a fraudulent transfer and could impose a number of different remedies, including without limitation, returning our assets or your shares in our company to Hilton or providing Hilton with a claim for money damages against us in an amount equal to the difference between the consideration received by Hilton and the fair market value of our company at the time of the spin-off.\nThe measure of insolvency for purposes of the fraudulent conveyance laws may vary depending on which jurisdiction\u2019s law is applied. Generally, however, an entity would be considered insolvent if the fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount of its liabilities (including the probable amount of contingent liabilities), and such entity would be considered to have unreasonably small capital if it lacked adequate capital to conduct its business in the ordinary course and pay its liabilities as they become due. No assurance can be given as to what standard a court would apply to determine insolvency or that a court would determine that Hilton were solvent at the time of or after giving effect to the spin-off, including the distribution of our common stock.\nWe could be required to assume responsibility for obligations allocated to Hilton or Park under the Distribution Agreement.\nWe entered into the Distribution Agreement with Hilton and Park prior to the distribution of our shares of common stock to Hilton stockholders. Under the Distribution Agreement and related ancillary agreements, each of us, Hilton and Park are generally responsible for the debts, liabilities and other obligations related to the business or businesses that they own and operate following the spin-off. Although we do not expect to be liable for any obligations that were not allocated to us under the Distribution Agreement, a court could disregard the allocation agreed to among the parties, and require that we assume responsibility for obligations allocated to Hilton or Park (for example, tax and/or environmental liabilities), particularly if Hilton or Park were to refuse or were unable to pay or perform the allocated obligations.\nIn addition, losses in respect of certain Shared Contingent Liabilities, which generally are not specifically attributable to any of the timeshare business, the Park business or the retained business of Hilton, were determined on or prior to the date on which the Distribution Agreement was entered. The percentage of Shared Contingent Liabilities for which we are responsible has been fixed in a manner that is intended to approximate our estimated enterprise value on the distribution date relative to the estimated enterprise values of Park and Hilton. Subject to certain limitations and exceptions, Hilton is generally vested with the exclusive management and control of all matters pertaining to any such Shared Contingent Liabilities, including the prosecution of any claim and the conduct of any defense.\nIn connection with the spin-offs, we may be required to indemnify Hilton and Park, and the indemnities of Hilton and Park of us may not be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of the liabilities assumed by Hilton and Park, and Hilton and Park may be unable to satisfy their indemnification obligations to us in the future.\nPursuant to the Distribution Agreement entered into in connection with the spin-offs and certain other agreements among Hilton and Park and us, we agreed to indemnify each of Hilton and Park from certain liabilities. Indemnities that we may be required to provide Hilton and/or Park may be significant and could negatively affect our business.\nIn addition, each of Hilton and Park agreed to indemnify us with respect to such parties\u2019 assumed or retained liabilities pursuant to the Distribution Agreement and breaches of the Distribution Agreement or other agreements related to the spin-offs. There can be no assurance that the indemnities from each of Hilton and Park will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of these and other liabilities. Third parties also could seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that Hilton and Park have agreed to assume. Even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Hilton or Park any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear those losses ourselves. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nPursuant to the Distribution Agreement and certain other agreements, including the Tax Matters Agreement, entered into in connection with the spin-offs among Hilton and Park and us, we agreed to indemnify each of Hilton and Park from certain liabilities (including tax liabilities). In addition to the Shared Contingent Liabilities pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, the Tax Matters Agreement governs the respective obligations of Hilton, Park and us after the spin-off with respect to tax liabilities and benefits, tax attributes, tax contests, liability resulting from tax audits and other tax sharing regarding U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income taxes, other tax matters and related tax returns. Under the Tax Matters Agreement, we have agreed to indemnify Hilton and Park against certain tax liabilities. The Tax Matters Agreement also provides special rules for allocating tax liabilities in the event that the spin-off is not tax-free. In general, under the Tax Matters Agreement, each party is responsible for any taxes imposed on Hilton that arise from the failure of the spin-off and certain related transactions to qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, as applicable, and certain other relevant provisions of the Code, to the extent that the failure to qualify is attributable to actions taken by such party (or with respect to such party\u2019s stock). In addition, the parties share responsibility, in accordance with sharing percentages of 65 percent for Hilton, 26 percent for Park, and nine percent for us, for any such taxes imposed on Hilton that are not attributable to actions taken by a party. Finally, pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement, to the extent that any taxes that may be imposed on the Hilton consolidated group for the taxable periods prior to the spin-offs relates to the timeshare business, we would in most cases be liable for the full amount attributable to the timeshare business. Indemnities that we may be required to provide Hilton and/or Park, or any liabilities for which we may be responsible proportionately or wholly, pursuant to these agreements may be significant and could negatively affect our business.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur board of directors may change significant corporate policies without stockholder approval.\nOur financing, borrowing and dividend policies and our policies with respect to all other activities, including growth, debt, capitalization and operations, will be determined by our board of directors. These policies may be amended or revised at any time and from time to time at the discretion of our board of directors without a vote of our stockholders. In addition, our board of directors may change our policies with respect to conflicts of interest provided that such changes are consistent with applicable legal requirements. A change in these policies could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, our results of operations, our cash flow, the per share trading price of our common stock and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that you might consider favorable.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the merger or acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors. Among other things:\n\u2022these provisions allow us to authorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock in connection with a stockholder rights plan or otherwise, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include super voting, special approval, dividend, or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of common stock;\n\u2022these provisions prohibit stockholder action by written consent unless such action is recommended by all directors then in office;\n\u2022these provisions provide that our board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws and that our stockholders may only amend our bylaws with the approval of 80 percent or more of all the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote; and\n\u2022these provisions establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, which may impair a takeover attempt that our stockholders may find beneficial. These anti-takeover and other applicable Delaware law provisions and measures could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company, including actions that our stockholders may deem advantageous, or negatively affect the trading price of our common stock. These provisions and measures could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desire.\nConsent requirements in our license agreement with Hilton and other requirements in certain of our other material agreements may have the effect of deterring a potential takeover transaction that otherwise could be in the best interests of our stockholders.\nOur license agreement with Hilton requires us to obtain Hilton\u2019s consent prior to taking certain significant corporate actions, including engaging in a takeover transaction. There can be no assurance that any consent from Hilton to a change of control of our company could be obtained on a basis satisfactory to us or any potential acquirer. In addition, certain of our other material agreements, such as our debt agreements, contain consent, notice, prepayment or other provisions that we are obligated to comply with prior to engaging in certain transactions. Failure to obtain required consents and comply with other provisions in these agreements could discourage, materially delay or prevent a transaction that otherwise may be in the best interests of our stockholders.\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may fluctuate widely.\nFor many reasons, the market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may be influenced in the future by a number of factors, including the risks identified in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These factors may result in short-term or long-term negative pressure on the value of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, depending upon many factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022shifts in our investor base;\n\u2022our quarterly and annual earnings, or those of comparable companies;\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022our ability to obtain financing as needed;\n\u2022changes in laws and regulations affecting our business;\n\u2022changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant investments, acquisitions or dispositions;\n\u2022the failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock;\n\u2022changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;\n\u2022the operating performance and stock price of comparable companies;\n\u2022overall market fluctuations;\n\u2022a decline in the real estate markets; and\n\u2022general economic conditions and other external factors.\nFuture issuances of common stock by us may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nNone of the shares outstanding upon consummation of the spin-off were \u201crestricted securities\u201d within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act, and substantially all of the outstanding shares of our common stock are freely tradable and available for resale in the public market, subject to certain restrictions in the case of control shares held by persons deemed to be our affiliates. Accordingly, the market price of our common stock could drop significantly if holders of a substantial number of shares of our common stock sell them in the public market, or if the market perceives that such sales could occur.\nWe adopted an Omnibus Incentive Plan under which an aggregate of 10,000,000 shares of HGV common stock are issuable. As of December 31, 2021, an aggregate of 1,573,758 shares have been issued, and an additional 3,872,206 shares were underlying outstanding awards pursuant to the Omnibus Incentive Plan. We also adopted a Non-Employee Director Stock Plan under which 325,000 shares of our common stock are issuable, and an Employee Stock Purchase Plan under which 2,500,000 shares of our common stock are available for issuance. Under the Non-Employee Director Stock Plan, 117,360 shares had been issued, and there were an additional 16,902 shares underlying outstanding awards granted as of December 31, 2021. Under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, a total of 333,285 shares were issued as of December 31, 2021. Any further issuances could result in the dilution of our current stockholders causing the market price of shares of our common stock to decline.\nWe have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock, and our indebtedness could limit our ability to pay dividends in the future.\nAlthough we may return capital to stockholders through dividends or otherwise in the future, we have no current plans to pay any cash dividends. The declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends on shares of common stock will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors. Our board of directors may take into account general and economic conditions, our financial condition and results of operations, our available cash, current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, contractual, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by us to our stockholders or by our subsidiaries to us, and such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends is limited by our credit agreement related to our senior secured credit facilities. Our ability to pay dividends may also be limited by covenants of other indebtedness that we or our subsidiaries incur in the future.\nOur business could be negatively impacted as a result of actions by activist stockholders or others.\nStockholder activism has been increasing in publicly traded companies in recent years and we are subject to the risks associated with such activism, particularly due to the recent decline in our stock price. Our business could be negatively affected as a result of stockholder activism, which could cause us to incur significant legal fees and other costs, hinder execution of our business strategy and impact the trading value of our securities. Additionally, stockholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future direction, adversely affect our relationships with key executives and business partners and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified employees. Any of these impacts could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nRisks Related to the Integration of Diamond\nWe may not be able to integrate the acquired Diamond business successfully.\nOn August 2, 2021, we completed the Diamond Acquisition. The successful integration of the Diamond business with HGV will take significant and sustained amounts of effort and resources. Despite our efforts, it is possible that the integration process could take longer than anticipated and/or could be more difficult than anticipated due to a number of reasons, including the lack of complementary products and resort offerings, delays or other challenges in converting the Diamond resorts into resorts that are suitable for HGV as part of our overall strategy, loss of valuable employees, disruption of each company\u2019s ongoing businesses, processes and systems, inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, practices, policies and compensation arrangements between the two businesses, and differences in corporate cultures and philosophies, and other challenges that are inherent in such a complex integration of businesses. There also may be issues attributable to Diamond\u2019s operations that were inherent to the business or are based on events or actions that occurred prior to the closing of the Diamond Acquisition that may make the integration even more challenging. In addition, uncertainty about the effect of the Diamond Acquisition on relationships with our suppliers, vendors, existing owners, and potential owners may hinder the integration. Although we are taking steps designed to reduce or mitigate any adverse effects, these uncertainties may cause suppliers, vendors, existing and potential owners, and others that deal with us to seek to change, not renew or discontinue existing business relationships with us.\nIntegrating the acquired Diamond business into our operations may place a significant burden on management and internal resources and divert management\u2019s attention away from day-to-day business concerns. Further, our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel and employees may be impacted if employees or prospective employees have uncertainty about their future roles with us during the integration of the Diamond Acquisition and beyond. Despite our retention and recruiting efforts, key employees may be unwilling to continue their employment with us and we may be unable to timely find suitable replacements.\nWe have agreed with Hilton to develop a mutually agreeable plan pursuant to which the Diamond properties are to be operated during the integration period, and with respect to those Diamond properties that will not be converted to our brand. If we fail to develop and/or execute such a plan with Hilton, such properties may remain subject to a number of restrictions related to how they are operated.\nUltimately, the integration process is subject to a number of uncertainties, and no assurance can be given that our integration efforts will be successful. Any one or more of the foregoing factors may adversely affect or hinder any successful integration of the Diamond acquisition and may materially adversely impact the execution of our strategy post-acquisition, business, operations, and, ultimately, our results of operations.\nAnticipated cost savings, synergies, growth in operating results and related benefits of the Diamond Acquisition may not be realized. In addition, we may incur substantial costs and expenses related to the Diamond Acquisition and the integration beyond what we have anticipated, which may include unknown liabilities at the time of the closing. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe completed the Diamond Acquisition with the expectation that it will result in various benefits and synergies, including, among other things, operating efficiencies, and opportunities to potentially increase our revenue, sales, EBITDA, owners, and cost savings. Achieving such anticipated benefits and synergies of the Diamond Acquisition within the expected timeframe, or at all, is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether the businesses of HGV and Diamond can be integrated in an efficient and effective manner, as previously discussed, as well as various assumptions. It is possible that any one or more of such benefits and synergies may not be realized, thereby significantly reducing the anticipated benefits associated with the Diamond Acquisition, and may result in higher than anticipated costs, and lower than anticipated revenue, and/or decreases in the amount of expected net income, all of which would adversely affect our future business, financial condition, and operating results.\nFurther, we incurred a number of fees, costs and expenses prior to completing the Diamond Acquisition and expect to continue to incur additional fees, costs and expenses associated with combining and integrating the operations of the two companies and achieving the desired benefits. These fees, costs and expenses, which are both recurring and non-recurring, have been, and will continue to be, substantial. Although we believe that achieving cost synergies, benefits, and other efficiencies of the Diamond Acquisition should offset such costs, fees and expenses over time, such net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all. Moreover, there may be significant potential liabilities associated with the Legacy Diamond business that we may uncover after the closing during the integration period, which may result in us incurring significant costs and expenses in the future. Such potential liabilities may have been unknown to us at prior to the closing of the Diamond Acquisition and/or more significant than we believed at such time. Any such material unexpected costs and expenses may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nOur stockholders prior to the Diamond Acquisition have a reduced ownership and voting interest as a result of the Diamond Acquisition and exercise less influence over management of us as compared to prior to the Diamond Acquisition.\nOur stockholders currently have the right to vote in the election of the board of directors and on other matters affecting us. Each Diamond stockholder who received shares of our common stock in the Diamond Acquisition is now our stockholder. Former Diamond stockholders, as a group, received shares in the Diamond Acquisition constituting approximately 28 percent of the shares of our common stock on a fully diluted basis immediately following the completion of the Diamond Acquisition. As a result, pre-Diamond Acquisition stockholders own, in the aggregate, approximately 72 percent of the shares of our common stock on a fully diluted basis immediately following the completion of the Diamond Acquisition. Because of this, our stockholders prior to the completion of the Diamond Acquisition now have comparatively less influence on our management and policies.\nOur results will suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations resulting from the Diamond Acquisition.\nThe size of our business increased significantly as a result of the Diamond Acquisition. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to manage this expanded business, including in non-US jurisdictions where we did not have operations prior to the Diamond Acquisition, which pose new and substantial challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of expanded operations and associated increased costs and complexity. We may also need to obtain approvals of developers or HOAs in various instances to include additional resorts in the multi-resort trusts marketed, sold and managed by the acquired Diamond business (the \u201cDiamond Collections\u201d) or increase maintenance fees or impose additional requirements in order to meet our brand\nand operating standards. There can be no assurances that we will be successful or that we will realize the expected operating efficiencies, cost savings and other benefits currently anticipated from the transaction. In addition, there will be increased compliance and regulatory risk as a result of the expanded size of our business.\nWe may be subject to complaints, litigation or reputational harm due to dissatisfaction with, or concerns related to, the Diamond Acquisition from our and former Diamond owners.\nOur and former Diamond VOI owners prior to the completion of the Diamond Acquisition may be concerned about the actual or perceived impact of the Diamond Acquisition and the integration on their VOIs, including the potential reduction in quality of resorts and product offerings due to the increased size of the business and addition of new owners, the potential adverse effect on the availability of access to these resorts and other disruptions during the integration period, or the potential increase or change in HOA or other fees. The VOI owners of the acquired Diamond business may have similar concerns related to a decline in the quality of product offerings or increase in fees as a result of the Diamond Acquisition and increase in size of the business. Complaints or litigation brought by existing owners following the completion of the Diamond Acquisition could harm our reputation, discourage potential new owners and adversely impact our results of operations\nInterests in the acquired Diamond resorts are offered through a trust system, which is subject to a number of regulatory and other requirements.\nThe Diamond Collections located in the United States are alternatives to traditional deeded timeshare ownership, as they create a network of available resort accommodations at multiple locations. For those US-based Diamond Collections, title to the units available through the Diamond Collections is held in a trust or similar arrangement that is administered by an independent trustee (the \u201cCollection Trustee\u201d). A purchaser of a timeshare interest in a Collection does not receive a deeded interest in any specific resort or resort accommodation, but acquires a membership in the timeshare plan which is denominated by an annual or biennial allotment of points. Owners of Diamond\u2019s timeshare interests are allowed to use their allocated points to reserve accommodations at the various component site(s)/participating resort(s) within the Diamond Collections, thereby giving the members greater flexibility to plan their vacations. Owners may also elect to reserve accommodations at resorts that are not part of their Collection through Diamond\u2019s exchange programs.\nThe Diamond Collections are registered pursuant to, exempted from, or otherwise in compliance with, the applicable statutory requirements for the sale of timeshare plans in a growing number of jurisdictions. Such registrations and formal exemption determinations for the Diamond Collections confirm the substantial compliance with the filing and disclosure requirements of the respective timeshare statutes by the developer of the applicable Diamond Collection. It does not constitute the endorsement of the creation, sale, promotion or operation of the Diamond Collections by any regulatory body nor relieve the developer of a Diamond Collection or any affiliates of such developer of any duty or responsibility under other statutes or any other applicable laws. Registration under a respective timeshare act (or other applicable law) is not a guarantee or assurance of compliance with applicable law nor an assurance or guarantee of how any judicial body may interpret the Diamond Collections\u2019 compliance therewith. A determination that specific provisions or operations of the Collections do not comply with relevant timeshare acts or applicable law may have a material adverse effect on the developer, the Collection Trustee and the related non-profit members association for each of the Diamond Collections. If we are unable to successfully integrate and manage the trust system our results of operations or reputation may suffer.\nOur ability to integrate the acquired Diamond business could be harmed if Hilton does not consent to the use of their trademarks in connection with the conversion of Diamond properties.\nWhile Hilton had previously consented to the Diamond Acquisition as required by the license agreement, under the terms of the license agreement, we must obtain Hilton\u2019s approval to use the Hilton brand names and trademarks in connection with the conversion of the Diamond properties to branded properties using the Hilton marks as part of our integration strategy. In addition, we intend to offer and sell a new Hilton licensed product that will provide new owners access to both HGV-legacy properties as well as Diamond properties that are converted to our branded properties. As we continue to proceed with executing our overall integration and conversion plans, Hilton still retains certain approval rights with respect to such conversions. If Hilton does not consent to such conversions and/or permits us to use its trademarks in connection with such conversions and integrations (as well as the offer and sale of a new\nproduct), on a timely basis or at all, or if we cannot come to an agreement with Hilton on how to brand and operate Diamond properties that are not approved by Hilton, our ability to successfully integrate Diamond may be materially adversely affected. The requirement to obtain approval for such conversions and integrations of Diamond properties may delay implementation of our integration plans or cause us to incur additional expenses related to the branding of our properties. In addition, we may conclude that it\u2019s necessary to enter into future amendments and/or modifications to the license agreement that may be necessary in connection with the integration and conversion plans. If we and Hilton are unable to reach agreements on any such amendments and/or modifications, our integration and conversion plans may be delayed and/or may not comport to the current terms and conditions of the license agreement, which will adversely affect our business and operations.\nOur ability to successfully integrate the Diamond business depends on our compliance with the license agreement, including the \u201cSeparate Operations\u201d provisions and certain prohibitions on doing business with competitors. While the parties may agree to amend the applicable requirements, ongoing requirements with strict compliance with such provisions as currently written will negatively impact the synergies and efficiencies related to the Diamond acquisition.\nWe have agreed with Hilton to operate the Diamond business as a \u201cSeparate Operation\u201d under the license agreement. Complying with that requirement could be costly and difficult and will likely significantly diminish the efficiencies and synergies that are critical to our successful integration of the Diamond business. In addition, the license agreement requires Hilton\u2019s approval in connection with our anticipated conversion of the Diamond properties into our branded properties and/or Hilton Vacation Club or another new brand of properties. The creation of any such new brand will also require Hilton\u2019s consent. While we and Hilton have agreed to modify the Separate Operations requirements, with such modifications to be made in Hilton\u2019s sole discretion, so as to allow us to achieve greater operating efficiency and synergy than currently realizable under the license agreement, any failure of the parties to do so will adversely impact such operating efficiency and synergy. In addition, any failure to obtain Hilton\u2019s approval with respect to the creation of any new brand or the conversion of Diamond properties into such new brand or existing branded properties will significantly harm our ability to integrate the Diamond business and its properties. If we cannot come to an agreement with Hilton on how to brand and operate Diamond properties that do not currently or will not in the future meet the Hilton brand standards, then we will be required to continue to operate them as separate operations. However, since each property is part of a trust or collection or properties, we may be deemed to be in default of the license agreement if Hilton does not permit the operation of a collection that includes both branded and unbranded properties.\nIn addition, the license agreement contains a number of prohibitions on us entering into certain agreements and arrangements with competitors of Hilton. As a result of the Diamond Acquisition, we assumed Diamond\u2019s contracts with third parties, a number of which are with competitors of Hilton and are prohibited under the license agreement. The license agreement provides for a cure period for agreements or arrangements related to the Diamond business that would result in a violation or breach of provisions in the license agreement. However, to the extent we are not able to terminate such agreements within the cure period or we are unable to obtain a waiver from Hilton, we may be in default of the license agreement.", "PERMNO": 16498, "SIC": 6532, "TIC": "HGV"}
