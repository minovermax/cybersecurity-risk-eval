{"cik": "1635718", "company": "Gannett Co., Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-25", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information contained or incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K, prospective investors should consider carefully the following risk factors before investing in our securities. The risks described below may not be the only risks we face. Additional risks that we do not yet perceive or that we currently believe are immaterial may adversely affect our business and the trading price of our securities.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nChanges in economic conditions are expected to continue to affect advertising demand.\nOur operating results depend on the relative strength of the economy as well as the strength or weakness of regional and national economic factors. Our operating revenues are sensitive to discretionary spending available to advertisers and subscribers in the markets we serve, as well as advertiser and subscriber perceptions of economic trends and uncertainty. Total advertising revenues have declined in recent years, reflecting general trends in the newspaper industry and soft economic conditions affecting advertising demand, particularly in the retail sector. A decline in the economic prospects of advertisers, subscribers or the economy in general could alter current or prospective advertisers\u2019 and subscribers\u2019 spending priorities. All of these factors may further materially and adversely impact our ability to grow or maintain our operating revenue.\nIncreasing popularity of digital media and the shift in newspaper readership demographics, consumer habits and advertising expenditures from traditional print to digital media have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our operating revenues and may require significant capital investments due to changes in technology.\nTechnology in the media industry continues to evolve rapidly. Advances in technology have led to an increasing number of methods for delivery of news and other content and have resulted in a wide variety of consumer demands and expectations, which are also rapidly evolving. If we are unable to exploit new and existing technologies to distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors or adapt to new distribution methods that provide optimal user experiences, our business and financial results may be adversely affected.\nThe increasing number of digital media options available online, through social networking tools and through mobile and other devices that distribute news and other content, is expanding consumer choice significantly. Faced with a multitude of media choices and a dramatic increase in accessible information, consumers may place greater value on when, where, how and at what price they consume content than they do on the source or reliability of such content. Further, as existing newspaper readers get older, younger generations may not develop similar readership habits. News aggregation websites and customized news feeds (often free to users) may reduce our traffic levels by creating a disincentive for the audience to visit our websites or use our digital applications. If traffic levels stagnate or decline, we may not be able to create sufficient advertiser interest in our digital businesses or to maintain or increase the advertising rates of the inventory on our digital platforms.\nIn addition, the range of advertising choices across digital products and platforms and the large inventory of available digital advertising space have historically resulted in significantly lower rates for digital advertising than for print advertising. Consequently, our digital advertising revenue may not be able to replace print advertising revenue lost as a result of the shift to digital consumption. Reduced demand for our offerings or a surplus of advertising inventory could lead to a reduction in pricing and advertising spending, which could have an adverse effect on our businesses and assets. Our ability to maintain and improve the performance of our customers\u2019 advertising on our digital properties may impact rates we achieve in the marketplace for our advertising inventory.\nStagnation or a decline in website traffic levels due to subscription models or other factors may materially and adversely affect our advertiser base and advertising rates and result in a decline in digital revenue.\nSubscription models require users to pay for content after accessing a limited number of pages or news articles for free on our websites each month. Our ability to build a subscriber base on our digital platforms through subscription offers depends on market acceptance, consumer habits, pricing, an adequate online infrastructure and other factors. If our subscribers opt out of the subscription offers in greater numbers than anticipated, we may not generate expected revenue. In addition, the subscription model may result in fewer page views or unique visitors to our websites if digital viewers are unwilling to pay to gain access to our content. Stagnation or a decline in website traffic levels may materially and adversely affect our advertiser base and advertising rates and result in a decline in digital revenue.\nOur business operates in highly competitive markets with constant technological developments, and our ability to maintain market share and generate operating revenues depends on how effectively we compete with existing and new competition and on how technological developments affect our business.\nOur business operates in highly competitive markets. Our brands compete for audiences and advertising revenue with newspapers and other media such as the Internet, magazines, broadcast, cable and satellite television, radio, direct mail, outdoor billboards and yellow pages. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do.\nOur publications generate significant percentages of their advertising revenue from a few categories, including automotive, employment and real estate classified advertising, and retail advertising. Websites dedicated to classified advertising have become significant competitors of our print editions and digital platforms. As a result, even in the absence of a recession or economic downturn, technological, industry or other changes specifically affecting these advertising sources could reduce advertising revenues and materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends on our ability to respond and adapt to changes in technology and consumer behavior.\nTechnology in the media industry continues to evolve rapidly. Advances in technology have led to an increasing number of methods for the delivery and consumption of news and other content. These developments are driving changes in consumer behavior as consumers seek more control over the ways in which they consume content. Unless we are able to use new and existing technologies to distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors and develop in a timely manner compelling new products and services that engage users across platforms, our business, financial condition and prospects may be adversely affected.\nChanges in technology and consumer behavior pose a number of challenges that could adversely affect our revenues and competitive position. For example, among others:\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to develop products for mobile devices or other digital platforms that consumers find engaging, that work with a variety of operating systems and networks or that achieve a high level of market acceptance;\n\u2022\nthere may be changes in user sentiment about the quality or usefulness of our existing products;\n\u2022\nnews aggregation websites and customized news feeds may reduce our traffic levels by creating a disincentive for users to visit our websites or use our digital products;\n\u2022\nfailure to successfully manage changes in search engine optimization and social media traffic to increase our digital presence and visibility may reduce our traffic levels;\n\u2022\ntechnical or other problems could prevent us from delivering our products in a rapid and reliable manner or otherwise affect the user experience;\n\u2022\nnew delivery platforms may lead to pricing restrictions, the loss of distribution control and the loss of a direct relationship with consumers;\n\u2022\nmobile devices, including smartphones and tablets, may present challenges for traditional display advertising; and\n\u2022\ntechnology developed to block the display of advertising on websites could proliferate.\nResponding to these changes may require significant investment. We may be limited in our ability to invest funds and resources in digital products, services or opportunities, and we may incur research and development costs in building, maintaining and evolving our technology infrastructure.\nWe rely on revenue from the printing and distribution of publications for third parties that may be subject to many of the same business and industry risks facing us.\nWe generate a portion of our revenue from printing and distributing third-party publications, and our relationships with these third parties are generally pursuant to short-term contracts. As a result, if macroeconomic and industry trends, such as the sensitivity to perceived economic weakness of discretionary spending available to advertisers and subscribers, circulation declines, shifts in consumer habits and the increasing popularity of digital media affect those third parties, we may lose, in whole or in part, this source of revenue.\nNewsprint prices may continue to be volatile.\nNewsprint was one of our largest expenses during the year ended Dec. 27, 2015. The price of newsprint has historically been volatile, and may increase as a result of various factors, including declining newsprint supply as a result of paper mill closures and conversions to other grades of paper; and other factors that adversely impact supplier profitability, including increases in operating expenses caused by raw material and energy costs, and currency volatility. In addition, the consolidation of newsprint mills in the U.S. and Canada over the years has reduced the number of suppliers, which has led to increases in newsprint prices. Decreases in our current consumption levels, further supplier consolidation or the inability to maintain our existing relationships with our newsprint suppliers may materially and adversely impact newsprint prices in the future. In addition, we rely on suppliers for deliveries of newsprint. The availability of our newsprint supply may be affected by various factors, including labor unrest, transportation issues and other disruptions that may affect deliveries of newsprint. If newsprint prices increase significantly or we experience significant disruptions in the availability of our newsprint supply in the future, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe value of our assets or operations may be diminished if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or if we are the subject of a significant data breach or cyber-attack.\nOur information technology systems are critically important to operating our business efficiently and effectively. We rely on our information technology systems to manage our business data, communications, news and advertising content, digital products, order entry, fulfillment and other business processes. The failure of our information technology systems to perform as anticipated could disrupt our business and could result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, late or missed publications, and loss of sales and customers, causing our business and results of operations to be impacted.\nFurthermore, attempts to compromise information technology systems occur regularly across many industries and sectors, and we may be vulnerable to security breaches beyond our control. We invest in security resources and technology to protect our data and business processes against risk of data security breaches and cyber-attack, but the techniques used to attempt attacks are constantly changing. A significant breach or successful attack could have a negative impact on our operations or business reputation. We maintain cyber risk insurance, but this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all losses from any future breaches of our systems.\nSecurity breaches and other network and information systems disruptions could affect our ability to conduct our business effectively.\nOur online systems store and process confidential subscriber, employee and other sensitive personal data, and therefore maintaining our network security is of critical importance. The security of these network and information systems and other technologies is important to our business activities. We use third-party technology and systems for a variety of operations, including encryption and authentication technology, employee email, domain name registration, content delivery to customers, back-office support and other functions. Our systems, and those of third parties upon which our business relies, may be vulnerable to interruption or damage that can result from natural disasters, fires, power outages, acts of terrorism or other similar events, or from deliberate attacks such as computer hacking, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, process breakdowns, denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering or other malicious activities, or any combination of the foregoing.\nDespite the security measures we and our third-party service providers have taken, our computer systems, and those of our vendors, have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to attack. We have implemented controls and taken other preventative measures designed to strengthen our systems against attacks, including measures designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at our third-party vendors. Although the costs of the controls and other measures we have taken to date have not had a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, there can be no assurance as to the cost of additional controls and measures that we may conclude are necessary in the future.\nThere can also be no assurance that the actions, measures and controls we have implemented will be effective against future attacks or be sufficient to prevent a future security breach or other disruption to our network or information systems, or those of our third-party providers. Such an event could result in a disruption of our services or improper disclosure of personal data or confidential information, which could harm our reputation, require us to expend resources to remedy such a security breach or defend against further attacks, divert management\u2019s attention and resources or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased operating costs or loss of revenue.\nForeign exchange variability could materially and adversely affect our consolidated operating results.\nNewsquest operates in the U.K. and its operations are conducted in foreign currency, primarily the British pound sterling. Our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars. Newsquest results for 2015 were translated to U.S. dollars at the average rate of 1.53. Weakening of the British pound sterling to the U.S. dollar exchange rate could diminish Newsquest\u2019s earnings contribution to our consolidated results of operations.\nChanges in the regulatory environment could encumber or impede our efforts to improve operating results or the value of assets.\nOur publishing operations are subject to government regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate and our websites, which are accessible worldwide, may be subject to laws regarding the Internet even in jurisdictions where we do not do business. Changing regulations, the introduction of new laws and regulations, and penalties for any failure to comply may result in increased costs, reduced valuations or other impacts, all of which may adversely impact our future profitability.\nFuture strategic acquisitions, investments and partnerships could pose various risks, increase our leverage and significantly impact our ability to expand our overall profitability.\nAcquisitions, including our pending acquisition of JMG for cash consideration of approximately $280 million, involve inherent risks, such as potentially increasing leverage and debt service requirements and combining company cultures and facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flow and could strain our human resources. We may be unable to successfully implement effective cost controls, achieve expected synergies or increase revenues as a result of any future acquisition. Acquisitions may result in our assumption of unexpected liabilities and may result in the diversion of management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. Strategic investments and partnerships with other companies expose us to the risk that we may not be able to control the operations of our investee or partnership, which could decrease the amount of benefits we realize from a particular relationship. We are also exposed to the risk that our partners in strategic investments and infrastructure may encounter financial difficulties which could lead to disruption of investee or partnership activities, or impairment of assets acquired, which would adversely affect future reported results of operations and stockholders\u2019 equity. In addition, we may be unable to obtain financing necessary to complete acquisitions on attractive terms or at all. The failure to obtain regulatory approvals may prevent us from completing or realizing the anticipated benefits of acquisitions. Furthermore, acquisitions may subject us to new or different regulations which could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nThe value of our existing intangible assets may become impaired, depending upon future operating results.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets were approximately $576 million as of Dec. 27, 2015, representing approximately 24% of our total assets. We periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may no longer be recoverable, in which case a charge to earnings may be necessary. Any future evaluations requiring an asset impairment charge for goodwill or other intangible assets would adversely affect future reported results of operations and stockholders\u2019 equity, although such charges would not affect our cash flow.\nAdverse results from litigation or governmental investigations could impact our business practices and operating results.\nFrom time to time, we are a party to litigation and regulatory, environmental and other proceedings with governmental authorities and administrative agencies. Adverse outcomes in lawsuits or investigations could result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition as well as our ability to conduct our businesses as they are presently being conducted.\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights that are material to our business, or to defend successfully against intellectual property infringement claims by third parties.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends in part upon our intellectual property rights, including our trademarks, copyrights and proprietary technology. Our use of contractual provisions, confidentiality procedures and agreements, and trademark, copyright, patent, unfair competition, trade secret and other laws to protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary technology and the use of the rights and technology of others may not be adequate. Advancements in technology have made the unauthorized duplication and wide dissemination of content easier, making enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and to protect our proprietary technology, or to defend against claims by third parties that the conduct of our businesses or our use of intellectual property infringes upon such third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, including trademark, copyright and patent infringement. If we are unable to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights, we may not realize the full value of our intellectual property assets and our business and profitability may suffer. Furthermore, any intellectual property litigation or claims brought against us, whether or not meritorious, could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources, and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained in all cases. The terms of any settlement or judgment may require us to pay substantial amounts to the other party or cease exercising our rights in such intellectual property. In addition, we may have to seek a license to continue practices found to be in violation of a third party\u2019s rights, which may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all. Our business, financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected as a result.\nOur ability to operate effectively could be impaired if we fail to attract and retain our senior management team.\nOur success depends, in part, upon the continuing contributions of our senior management team. The loss of the services of any members of our senior management team or the failure to attract qualified persons to our senior management team may have a material adverse effect on our business or our business prospects.\nLabor strikes, lockouts and protracted negotiations could lead to business interruptions and increased operating costs.\nAs of Dec. 27, 2015, union employees comprised approximately 13% of our workforce. We are required to negotiate collective bargaining agreements on an ongoing basis. Complications in labor negotiations can lead to work slowdowns or other business interruptions and greater overall employee costs. If we or our suppliers are unable to renew expiring collective bargaining agreements, it is possible that the affected unions or others could take action in the form of strikes or work stoppages. Such actions, higher costs in connection with these agreements or a significant labor dispute could materially and adversely affect our business by disrupting our ability to provide customers with our products or services. Depending on its duration, any lockout, strike or work stoppage may have an adverse effect on our operating revenues, cash flows or operating income, or the timing thereof.\nVolatility in global financial markets directly affects the value of our pension plan assets and liabilities.\nOur two largest retirement plans, which account for more than 95% of total pension plan assets, were underfunded as of Dec. 27, 2015 by $492 million on a U.S. GAAP basis. Various factors, including future investment returns, discount rates and potential pension legislative changes, impact the timing and amount of pension contributions we may be required to make in the future.\nRisks Related to the Separation\nWe have limited operating history as a separate public company and may be unable to operate profitably as a stand-alone company.\nWe have limited operating history as a separate, stand-alone public company. We cannot be certain that, as a separate public company, operating results will continue at historical levels, or that we will be profitable. Additionally, prior to the separation, we relied on our former parent for various financial, administrative and managerial services in conducting our operations. Following the separation, we maintain our own credit and banking relationships and perform our own financial and investor relations functions. Prior to the separation, we shared economies of scope and scale in costs, employees, vendor relationships and customer relationships. We could experience some increased costs as a result of the absence of such economies of scale. Any such additional or increased costs may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur historical financial information may not be indicative of our future results as a separate public company.\nThe historical financial information we have included in this report for the period prior to the separation may not reflect what our results of operations, financial position and cash flows would have been had we been a separate public company during the periods presented or be indicative of what our results of operations, financial position and cash flows may be in the future as a separate public company. The historical financial information for the periods prior to the distribution does not reflect the increased costs associated with being a separate public company, including changes in our cost structure, personnel needs, financing, and operations of our business as a result of the distribution. Our historical financial information for the periods prior to the distribution reflects allocations for services historically provided by our former parent, and we expect these allocated costs to be different from the actual costs we will incur for these services in the future as a separate public company. In some instances, the costs incurred for these services as a separate public company may be higher than the share of expenses allocated to our business historically.\nWe may incur increased costs after or as a result of the separation from our former parent that may cause our profitability to decline.\nHistorically, prior to the separation our business operated as one of our former parent\u2019s segments, and our former parent performed many corporate functions for our operations, including managing financial and human resources systems, internal auditing, investor relations, treasury services, select accounting functions, finance and tax administration, benefits administration, legal, governmental relations and regulatory functions. Following the separation, our former parent has provided transitional support to us with respect to certain of these functions. We have been replicating certain systems, infrastructure and personnel to which we no longer have access from our former parent. However, we may misjudge our requirements for these services and systems on a stand-alone basis, and may incur greater than expected capital and other costs associated with developing and implementing our own support functions in these areas. These costs may exceed the costs we pay to our former parent during the transition period. In addition, there may be an adverse operational effect on our business as a result of the significant time our management and other employees and internal resources will need to dedicate to building these capabilities during the first few years following the separation that otherwise would be available for other business initiatives and opportunities. As we operate these functions independently, if we have not developed adequate systems and business functions, or obtained them from other providers, we may not be able to operate the company effectively and our profitability may decline.\nWe or our former parent may fail to perform under various transition services agreements and other agreements that were executed as part of the separation or we may fail to have necessary systems and services in place when certain of the transition services agreements expire.\nIn connection with the separation, we and our former parent entered into a separation agreement and various other agreements, including a transition services agreement, a tax matters agreement and an employee matters agreement. These agreements include any necessary indemnifications related to liabilities and obligations. The transition services agreement provided for the performance of certain services by each company for the benefit of the other for a limited period of time after the separation. If our former parent is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements, including its indemnification obligations, we could incur operational difficulties or losses. If we do not have agreements with other providers of these services once these agreements expire or terminate, we may not be able to operate our business effectively and our profitability may decline.\nThere could be significant liability if the distribution were determined to be a taxable transaction.\nIn connection with the distribution, our former parent received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that the requirements for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code would be satisfied. The opinion relied on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from our former parent and us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies\u2019 respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings were incorrect or not satisfied, we and our stockholders may not be able to rely on the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities.\nNotwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel, the IRS could determine upon audit that the separation is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings were incorrect or violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion, or for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant changes in the share ownership of our company or our former parent after the separation. If the separation were determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, our former parent and its stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities, and we could incur significant liabilities.\nWe may be unable to engage in certain corporate transactions because such transactions could jeopardize the tax-free status of the distribution.\nUnder the tax matters agreement that we entered into with our former parent, we are restricted from taking any action that prevents the distribution and related transactions from being tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Under the tax matters agreement, for the two-year period following the distribution, we are prohibited, except in certain circumstances, from:\n\u2022\nentering into any transaction resulting in the acquisition of 40% or more of our stock or substantially all of our assets, whether by merger or otherwise;\n\u2022\nmerging, consolidating or liquidating;\n\u2022\nissuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds;\n\u2022\nrepurchasing our capital stock beyond certain thresholds; and\n\u2022\nceasing to actively conduct our business.\nThese restrictions may limit our ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or other transactions that we may believe to be in the best interests of our stockholders or that might increase the value of our business. In addition, under the tax matters agreement, we are required to indemnify our former parent against any such tax liabilities as a result of the acquisition of our stock or assets, even if we did not participate in or otherwise facilitate the acquisition.\nWe may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the separation, and the separation may materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe may be unable to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the separation, or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all. The separation was expected to provide the following benefits, among others:\n\u2022\na distinct investment identity allowing investors to evaluate the merits, strategy, performance and future prospects of our business separately from our former parent;\n\u2022\nmore efficient allocation of capital for both our former parent and us;\n\u2022\ndirect access by us to the capital markets;\n\u2022\nability to pursue value-enhancing acquisitions with fewer regulatory obstacles in two consolidating industries; and\n\u2022\nfacilitating incentive compensation arrangements for employees that are more directly tied to the performance of the relevant company\u2019s business, and enhancing employee hiring and retention by, among other things, improving the alignment of management and employee incentives with performance and growth objectives, while at the same time creating an independent equity structure that facilitates our ability to affect future acquisitions utilizing our common stock.\nWe may not achieve these and other anticipated benefits for a variety of reasons, including, among others: (a) following the separation, we may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than if we were still a part of our former parent; and (b) following the separation, our business will be less diversified than our former parent\u2019s business prior to the separation. If we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits expected to result from the separation, or if such benefits are delayed, our business, financial conditions and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nA portion of our advertising revenues is earned under affiliation agreements which may be terminated or amended to provide for less favorable terms following the separation.\nIn connection with the separation, we entered into a modified affiliation agreement with CareerBuilder, which is majority owned by our former parent, and Cars.com, which is wholly owned by our former parent. These modified affiliation agreements are intended to permit our publications to continue to earn advertising revenues from CareerBuilder and Cars.com for up to five years following the separation, although each may be terminated earlier in certain circumstances including, in the case of Cars.com, if we fail to achieve specified performance standards. We expect that the terms of the modified affiliate agreements will result in lower advertising revenue than was the case prior to the distribution. There can also be no assurance that our publications will be able to renew these new affiliation agreements at the end of the five-year term on similar terms, or at all, or continue to earn the same level of advertising revenues under such affiliation agreements.\nIf we cease to earn advertising revenues under the modified affiliation agreements with CareerBuilder and Cars.com or the amount of such revenues is materially reduced, our operating revenues, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nFulfilling our obligations incidental to being a public company, including with respect to the requirements of and related rules under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, will place significant demands on our management, administrative and operational resources, including accounting and information technology resources.\nOur financial results previously were included in the consolidated results of our former parent, and our reporting and control systems were appropriate for those of subsidiaries of a public company. Prior to the distribution, we were not directly subject to reporting and other requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), and Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. As a result of the separation, we are now subject to such reporting and other requirements, which will require, among other things, annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and a report by our independent registered public accounting firm addressing these assessments. These and other obligations will place significant demands on our management, administrative and operational resources, including accounting and information technology resources.\nRisks Relating to our Debt Agreements\nWe have only a limited independent history of obtaining financing from banks or through public markets to satisfy capital requirements in operating our business.\nHistorically, our working capital requirements and capital for our general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and capital expenditures, were satisfied as part of the corporate-wide cash management policies of our former parent. We may need to obtain additional financing from banks, through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities, strategic relationships or other arrangements, which may or may not be available and may be more costly. In addition, the cost of capital for our business may be higher than our former parent\u2019s cost of capital prior to the separation.\nOur debt agreements contain restrictions that may limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nOur debt agreements contain various covenants that limit our flexibility in operating our businesses, including our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. Subject to certain exceptions, these covenants restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things:\n\u2022\npermit certain liens on current or future assets;\n\u2022\nenter into certain corporate transactions;\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nmake certain payments or declare certain dividends or distributions;\n\u2022\ndispose of certain property;\n\u2022\nprepay or amend the terms of other indebtedness; and\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with affiliates.\nRisks Relating to our Stock\nWe cannot guarantee the timing, amount or payment of dividends on our common stock.\nThe timing, declaration, amount and payment of future dividends to stockholders will fall within the discretion of our board of directors. The board\u2019s decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors, such as our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, any future debt service obligations, covenants associated with any of our future debt service obligations, industry practice, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors that the board deems relevant. Our ability to pay dividends will depend on our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and on our access to the capital markets.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation, by-laws, tax matters agreement, separation and distribution agreement, employee matters agreement, transition services agreement, and Delaware law may discourage takeovers and limit our ability to use, acquire, or develop certain competing businesses.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws contain certain provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us. For example, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws, collectively:\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of preferred stock that could be issued by our Board of Directors to thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nprovide that vacancies on our Board of Directors, including vacancies resulting from an enlargement of our Board of Directors, may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office;\n\u2022\nplace limits on which stockholders may call special meetings of stockholders, and limit the actions that may be taken at such stockholder-called special meetings;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent; and\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for elections as directors or to bring other business before an annual meeting of our stockholders.\nThese provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control, even though a majority of stockholders may consider such proposal, if effected, desirable. Such provisions could also make it more difficult for third parties to remove and replace the members of the Board of Directors. Moreover, these provisions may inhibit increases in the trading price of our common stock that may result from takeover attempts or speculation.\nUnder the tax matters agreement entered into at the time of the separation, we agreed to indemnify our former parent for certain tax related matters, and we may be unable to take certain actions as a result. We are unable to take certain actions because such actions could jeopardize the tax-free status of the distribution. Such restrictions could be significant, in addition, the separation and distribution agreement, the tax matters agreement, the employee matters agreement and the transition services agreement cover specified indemnification and other matters that may arise after the distribution. The separation and distribution agreement, the tax matters agreement, the employee matters agreement and the transition services agreement may have the effect of discouraging or preventing an acquisition of us or a disposition of our business. In addition, to the extent these agreements contain exclusivity or non-compete provisions, they may restrict our ability to use a competing service or to compete with our counterparty, which could have the effect of restricting our ability to maximize our performance in the provision of services, such as digital marketing services, online career services or online automobile sales services,.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the state courts of the State of Delaware, or, if no state court located in the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal court for the District of Delaware, as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could discourage lawsuits against us and our directors and officers.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that unless the board of directors otherwise determines, the state courts of the State of Delaware, or, if no state court located in the state of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal court for the District of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of us, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors or officers to us or our stockholders, creditors or other constituents, any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or the DGCL, or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against us or any our directors or officers governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholders find favorable for disputes with us or our directors or officers, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors and officers. Alternatively, if a court outside of Delaware were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.", "PERMNO": 15391, "SIC": 2711, "TIC": "GCI.1"}
