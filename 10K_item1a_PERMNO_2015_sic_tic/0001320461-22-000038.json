{"cik": "1320461", "company": "Cooper-Standard Holdings Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe have listed below (not necessarily in order of importance or probability of occurrence) the most significant risk factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent or anticipated results and could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOperational Risks\nOur financial condition and results of operations have been, and are expected to continue to be, adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe face risks related to public health issues, including epidemics and pandemics such as the global outbreak of COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic and preventative measures taken to contain or mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic have caused, and are continuing to cause, business slowdowns or shutdowns and significant disruption in the financial markets both in the United States and globally. The continued spread of COVID-19 and efforts to contain the virus and its related variants (including, but not limited to, vaccination, social distancing policies, restrictions on travel and reduced operations and extended closures of many businesses and institutions) may materially impact our financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022Facilities. A resurgence of the virus or new variant of concern could cause shutdowns of our and our customers\u2019 facilities. Although our automotive operations generally do not realize revenue while our facilities are shut down, we continue to incur significant operating and non-operating expenses associated with these facilities. In addition, government regulations and safety and social distancing procedures that we have implemented in our facilities have increased our operating costs, and we may not be able to pass along these increased costs to our customers.\n\u2022Supply chain. Our business relies on a number of third parties, including suppliers and distribution and logistics providers. One or more of these third parties may experience financial distress, staffing shortages or liquidity challenges, file for bankruptcy protection, go out of business, or suffer disruptions in their business due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, it is possible that one or more of these suppliers may also choose to change which products they offer with limited advance notification. These supply chain effects may have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand and may result in an increase in our costs of production and distribution, including increased freight and logistics costs and other expenses. A continued significant disruption to our production schedule will have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\n\u2022Workforce. If a significant percentage of our workforce, or the workforces of our suppliers and other third-party partners, is unable to work, whether because of illness, quarantine, limitations on travel or other government restrictions in connection with COVID-19, our operations may be negatively impacted. We also depend on senior management and other key personnel and contractors, and the illness of certain personnel or contractors could result in the loss of expertise and negatively affect our operations.\n\u2022Demand. An economic slowdown attributable to COVID-19 could lead to a sustained decline in new vehicle sales in regions where we operate, and particularly reduced new vehicle sales by our key customers, which could lead to reduced vehicle production, and, therefore, reduced demand for our products which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. See also the risk factor entitled \u201cWe are highly dependent on the automotive industry. A prolonged or material contraction in automotive sales and production volumes could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\u201d\n\u2022Liquidity. The COVID-19 pandemic has also caused significant disruptions to global financial markets. Such disruptions, together with the impact of COVID-19 on the automotive industry, may have a negative impact on our ability to access capital in the future on favorable terms or at all.\nThe full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, such as the ultimate duration and scope of the pandemic, its impact on our customers, suppliers and logistics partners, how quickly normal operations can resume and the duration and magnitude of the economic downturn caused by the pandemic in our key markets. In particular, the emergence of new variants could lead people to continue to self-isolate and not participate in the economy at pre-pandemic levels for a prolonged period of time. Further, government-sponsored liquidity or stimulus programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may not be available to our customers, suppliers or us and, if available, may nevertheless be insufficient to address the impacts of COVID-19. Therefore, it remains difficult to predict the extent or nature of these impacts at this time. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate the other risks disclosed in this Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nIncreases in the costs, or reduced availability, of raw materials and manufactured components may adversely affect our profitability.\nRaw material costs can be volatile. The principal raw materials to produce our products include synthetic and natural rubber, carbon black, process oils, and plastic resins. Principal procured components are primarily made from plastic, carbon steel, aluminum and stainless steel. Material costs represented approximately 47% of our total cost of products sold in 2021. The costs and availability of raw materials and manufactured components can fluctuate due to factors beyond our control, including as a result of existing and potential changes to U.S. policies related to global trade and tariffs. Further, climate change may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters, which may adversely affect the availability or pricing for certain raw materials including natural rubber. A significant increase in the price of raw materials, or a restriction in their availability, could materially increase our operating costs and adversely affect our profitability because it is generally difficult to pass through these increased costs to our customers. The recent disruptions to the global supply chain also have had an adverse impact on the cost and availability of raw materials, components, energy and other inputs used in our business, or in the businesses of our customers and suppliers, and has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and business.\nDisruptions in the supply chain could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe obtain components and other products and services from numerous suppliers and other vendors throughout the world. We are responsible for managing our supply chain, including suppliers that may be the sole sources of products that we require, that our customers direct us to use or that have unique capabilities that would make it difficult and/or expensive to re-source. In certain instances, entire industries may experience short-term capacity constraints. The global economy has experienced an increased risk of shortages and other disruptions to global supply chains due to strong demand, the potential effects of trade laws and tariffs, capacity constraints, financial instability, public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, or other circumstances. In particular, significant disruptions in supply have occurred, are occurring, and are expected to continue in the automotive industry due to these industry-wide parts shortages and global supply chain constraints which have adversely affected our operations and financial performance. The current uncertain economic or industry conditions could result in financial distress within our supply base, thereby further increasing the risk of supply disruption. As the uncertainty in the market conditions remain, any economic downturn or other unfavorable conditions in one or more of the regions in which we operate could cause further supply disruptions and thereby adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nMaterial supply shortages experienced by our customers either directly or as a result of a supply shortage at another supplier, such as the semiconductor shortage faced by the automotive industry, have caused customers to halt or limit the purchase of our products, which have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWork stoppages or other disruptions to our operations could negatively affect our operations and financial performance.\nWe may experience work stoppages caused by labor disputes under existing collective bargaining agreements or in connection with the negotiation of new agreements given that we have a number of agreements that expire in any given year. Further, there is no certainty that we will be successful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements that extend beyond the current expiration dates or that new agreements will be on terms as favorable to us as past labor agreements. In addition, it is possible that our workforce will become more unionized in the future. Unionization activities could increase our costs, which could negatively affect our results of operations.\nOur operations may also be disrupted by other labor issues, including absenteeism, public health issues, and pandemic-related government restrictions; major equipment failure with prolonged downtime or a complete loss of critical equipment where either no other comparable equipment exists or the remaining equipment does not have enough capacity to pick up the demand; or natural disaster-related plant closures or disruptions. In particular, natural disasters and adverse weather conditions can be caused or exacerbated by climate change, and the spate of extreme weather events experienced during 2021 presents an alarming trend.\nRegardless of the cause, any significant disruption to our production could negatively affect our operations, customer relationships and financial performance. Similar disruptions at one or more of our suppliers or our customers\u2019 suppliers could adversely affect our operations if an alternative source of supply were not readily available. Additionally, similar disruptions at our customers\u2019 facilities could result in reduced demand for our products causing us to delay or cancel production and could have an adverse effect on our business.\nA disruption in, or the inability to successfully implement upgrades to, our information technology systems, including disruptions relating to cybersecurity as well as data privacy concerns, could adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nWe rely upon information technology networks, systems and processes, including the information technology networks of third parties such as suppliers and joint venture partners, to manage and support our business. We have implemented a number of procedures and practices designed to protect against breaches or failures of our systems. Despite the security measures that we have implemented, including those measures to prevent cyber-attacks, our systems could be breached or damaged by computer viruses or unauthorized physical or electronic access. Like other public companies, our computer systems and those of our third-party vendors, partners and service providers are regularly subject to, and will continue to be the target of, computer viruses, malware or other malicious codes (including ransomware), unauthorized access, cyber-attacks or other computer-related penetrations which have caused, and may continue to cause, disruptions to our operations. While we have experienced threats to our data and systems, to date, we are not aware that we have experienced a material cyber-security breach. Over time, however, the sophistication of these threats continues to increase. The preventative actions we take to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect our information may be insufficient. A breach of our information technology systems, or those of the third parties on whom we rely, could result in theft of our intellectual property, disruption to business or unauthorized access to customer or\npersonal information. Such a breach could adversely impact our operations and/or our reputation and may cause us to incur significant time and expense to cure or remediate the breach.\nFurther, we continually update and expand our information technology systems to enable us to more efficiently run our business. If these systems are not implemented successfully, our operations and business could be disrupted and our ability to report accurate and timely financial results could be adversely affected.\nOur inability to effectively manage the timing, quality and costs of new program launches could adversely affect our financial performance.\nIn connection with the award of new business, we may obligate ourselves to deliver new products that are subject to our customers\u2019 timing, performance and quality standards. Given the number and complexity of new program launches, we may experience difficulties managing product quality, timeliness and associated costs. In addition, new program launches require a significant ramp up of costs. However, our sales related to these new programs generally are dependent upon the timing and success of our customers\u2019 introduction of new vehicles. Our inability to effectively manage the timing, quality and costs of these new program launches could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nOur success depends in part on our development of improved products, and our efforts may fail to meet the needs of customers on a timely or cost-effective basis.\nOur continued success depends on our ability to maintain advanced technological capabilities and knowledge necessary to adapt to changing market demands, as well as to develop and commercialize innovative products. We may be unable to develop new products successfully or to keep pace with technological developments by our competitors and the industry in general. In addition, we may develop specific technologies and capabilities in anticipation of customers\u2019 demands for new innovations and technologies. If such demand does not materialize, we may be unable to recover the costs incurred in the development of such technologies and capabilities. If we are unable to recover these costs or if any such programs do not progress as expected, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability and warranty and recall claims that may be brought against us.\nWe may be exposed to product liability and warranty claims in the event that our products actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected or the use of our products results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury and/or property damage. Accordingly, we could experience material warranty or product liability expenses in the future and incur significant costs to defend against these claims. In addition, if any of our products are, or are alleged to be, defective, we may be required to participate in a recall of that product if the defect or the alleged defect relates to automotive safety. Product recalls could cause us to incur material costs and could harm our reputation or cause us to lose customers, particularly if any such recall causes customers to question the safety or reliability of our products. Also, while we possess considerable historical warranty and recall data with respect to the products we currently produce, we do not have such data relating to new products, assembly programs or technologies, including any new fuel and emissions technology and systems being brought into production, to allow us to accurately estimate future warranty or recall costs.\nIn addition, the increased focus on systems integration platforms utilizing fuel and emissions technology with more sophisticated components from multiple sources could result in an increased risk of component warranty costs over which we have little or no control and for which we may be subject to an increasing share of liability to the extent any of the other component suppliers are in financial distress or are otherwise incapable of fulfilling their warranty or product recall obligations. Our costs associated with providing product warranties and responding to product recall claims could be material. Product liability, warranty and recall costs may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur commitment to drive value through culture, innovation and results is dependent on our ability to identify, attract, develop and retain a skilled, engaged and diverse workforce.\nOur people are the driving force behind our success at Cooper Standard. Our ability to pursue breakthrough technology innovations, implement cutting-edge manufacturing and business processes, and achieve our operating and strategic goals is dependent on the engagement, skills, experience and knowledge of our employees. Any failure or delay in attracting, retaining and developing such a workforce, including the loss of key technological and leadership personnel, could adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nStrategic Risks\nWe are highly dependent on the automotive industry. A prolonged or material contraction in automotive sales and production volumes could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAutomotive sales and production are cyclical and depend on, among other things, general economic conditions and consumer spending, vehicle demand and preferences (which can be affected by a number of factors, including fuel costs, employment levels and the availability of consumer financing). These factors could make it difficult for us, our suppliers and our customers to forecast accurately and plan future business activities. As the volume of automotive production and the mix of vehicles produced fluctuate, the demand for our products also fluctuates. Prolonged or material contraction in automotive sales and production volumes, or significant changes in the mix of vehicles produced, could cause our customers to reduce orders of our products, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition and our ability to provide accurate forecasts and guidance.\nWe may not realize sales represented by awarded business, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe realization of future sales from awarded business is subject to risks and uncertainties inherent in the cyclicality of vehicle production. In addition, our customers generally have the right to resource awarded business without penalty. Therefore, the ultimate amount of our sales is not guaranteed. If actual production orders from our customers are not consistent with the projections we use in calculating the amount of awarded business, we could realize substantially less sales and profit over the life of these awards than currently projected.\nEscalating pricing pressures may adversely affect our business.\nPricing pressure in the automotive supply industry has been substantial and is likely to continue. Nearly all vehicle manufacturers seek price reductions in both the initial bidding process and during the term of the contract. Price reductions have adversely impacted our sales and profit margins and are expected to do so in the future. If we are not able to offset continued price reductions through improved operating efficiencies and reduced expenditures, those price reductions may have a negative impact on our financial condition.\nOur business could be adversely affected if we lose any of our largest customers or significant platforms.\nWhile we provide parts to virtually every major global OEM for use on a wide range of different platforms, sales to our three largest customers, Ford, GM, and Stellantis, on a worldwide basis represented approximately 55% of our sales for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our ability to reduce the risks inherent in certain concentrations of business will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to diversify our sales on a customer, product, platform and geographic basis. Although business with each customer is typically split among numerous contracts, the loss of a major customer, significant reduction in purchases of our products by such customer, or any discontinuance or resourcing of a significant platform could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and efforts by our competitors to gain market share could adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe automotive parts industry is highly competitive. We face numerous competitors in each of our product lines. In general, there are three or more significant competitors and numerous smaller competitors for most of the products we offer. We also face competition for certain of our products from suppliers producing in lower-cost regions such as Asia and Eastern Europe. Our competitors\u2019 efforts to grow market share could exert downward pressure on the pricing of our products and our margins.\nThe benefits of our continuous improvement program and other cost savings plans may not be fully realized.\nOur operations strategy includes continuous improvement programs and implementation of lean manufacturing tools across all facilities to achieve cost savings and increased performance. Further, we have and may continue to initiate restructuring actions designed to improve future profitability and competitiveness. The cost savings that we anticipate from these initiatives may not be achieved on schedule or at the level we anticipate. If we are unable to realize these anticipated savings, our operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to other risks associated with our international operations.\nWe have significant manufacturing operations outside the United States, including joint ventures and other alliances. Our operations are located in 21 countries, and we export to several other countries. In 2021, approximately 77% of our sales were attributable to products manufactured outside the United States. Risks inherent in our international operations include:\n\u2022currency exchange rate fluctuations, currency controls and restrictions, and the ability to hedge currencies;\n\u2022changes in local economic conditions;\n\u2022repatriation restrictions or requirements, including tax increases on remittances and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries;\n\u2022global sovereign fiscal uncertainty and hyperinflation in certain foreign countries;\n\u2022changes in laws and regulations, including laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, and in particular increased trade restrictions, tariffs, or taxes or the imposition of embargoes on imports from countries where we manufacture products;\n\u2022operating in foreign jurisdictions where the ability to enforce rights over intellectual property is limited as a statutory or practical matter;\n\u2022continued political, economic and regulatory uncertainty as a result of the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d) on January 31, 2020, and the expiration of the transition period on December 31, 2020, including with respect to potential import/export restrictions or reduced trade levels that would affect products we ship to U.K. customers primarily from continental Europe;\n\u2022exposure to possible expropriation or other government actions;\n\u2022disease, pandemics or other severe public health events; and\n\u2022exposure to local political or social unrest including resultant acts of war, terrorism, or similar events.\nThe occurrence of any of these risks may adversely affect the results of operations and financial condition of our international operations and our business as a whole.\nExpanding our sales and manufacturing operations in the Asia Pacific region, particularly in China, is an integral part of our strategy, and, as a result, our exposure to the risks described above is substantial. Further, the uncertainty surrounding the consequences of Brexit may also cause disruptions to, and create a uncertainty surrounding our business, including potential import and export restrictions between the United Kingdom and the European Union, change in demand for our products due to the economic conditions created by Brexit and increased foreign exchange rate volatility.\nIn addition, we are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d) and other laws which prohibit improper payments to foreign governments and their officials by U.S. and other business entities. Certain of the countries in which we operate present heightened corruption risks, which therefore increases the risks of our exposure under the FCPA and other applicable anti-bribery and corruption laws and regulations.\nWe may continue to incur significant costs related to manufacturing facility closings or consolidation which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nIf we must close or consolidate manufacturing locations, the exit costs associated with such closures or consolidation, including employee termination costs, may be significant. Such costs could negatively affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nA portion of our operations are conducted by joint ventures which have unique risks.\nCertain of our operations are carried out by joint ventures. In joint ventures, we share the management of the company with one or more partners who may not have the same goals, resources or priorities as we do. The operations of our joint ventures are subject to agreements with our partners, which typically include additional organizational formalities as well as requirements to share information and decision making and may also limit our ability to sell our interest. Additional risks include one or more partners failing to satisfy contractual obligations, a change in ownership of any of our partners and our limited ability to control our partners\u2019 compliance with applicable laws, including the FCPA. Any such occurrences could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results, cash flow or reputation.\nAny acquisitions or divestitures we make may be unsuccessful, may take longer than anticipated or may negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may pursue acquisitions or divestitures in the future as part of our strategy. Acquisitions and divestitures involve numerous risks, including identifying attractive target acquisitions, undisclosed risks affecting the target, difficulties integrating acquired businesses, the assumption of unknown liabilities, potential adverse effects on existing customer or supplier relationships, and the diversion of management\u2019s attention from day-to-day business. We may not have, or be able to raise on acceptable terms, sufficient financial resources to make acquisitions. Our ability to make investments may also be limited by the terms of our existing or future financing arrangements. Any acquisitions or divestitures we pursue may not be successful or prove to be beneficial to our operations and cash flow.\nOur diversification strategy through the Advanced Technology Group poses new competitive threats and commercial risks.\nOur diversification strategy through the Advanced Technology Group is to leverage our core products in adjacent markets and license our innovation technology in non-automotive markets. We may be unsuccessful in leveraging our existing products and technology into new markets and thus in meeting the needs of these new customers and competing favorably in these new markets.\nFinancial Risks\nThe risks of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and global supply chain disruptions present significant risks to our liquidity.\nOur continued access to sources of liquidity depends on multiple factors, including global economic conditions, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and global supply chain disruptions on our customers and their production rates, the condition of global financial markets, the availability of sufficient amounts of financing, our operating performance and our credit ratings. While we currently have no outstanding borrowings under our ABL facility, our ability to borrow against the ABL facility is limited to our borrowing base, which consists primarily of our U.S. and Canadian accounts receivable and inventory. Production shutdowns in both the US and Canada could lead to significant reductions in these working capital balances and significantly decrease our ability to borrow under our ABL facility.\nIn addition, if the Company has availability for borrowing under its ABL facility less than the greater of (i) $15.0 million and (ii) 10% of the Borrowing Base (as defined in the ABL facility), it must be in compliance with a springing Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio maintenance covenant of 1.00:1.00. As of December 31, 2021, the Company was not able to satisfy such covenant, and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and global supply chain disruptions on its business will adversely impact its ability to satisfy such covenant for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the Company intends to manage any borrowings under its ABL facility to avoid triggering this maintenance covenant, which would further constrain its ability to utilize the ABL facility. As of December 31, 2021, there were no obligations outstanding under the ABL Facility. The Company\u2019s borrowing base was $169.7 million. Net the greater of 10% of the borrowing base or $15.0 million that cannot be borrowed without triggering the fixed charge coverage ratio maintenance covenant and $5.2 million of outstanding letters of credit, the Company effectively had $147.5 million available for borrowing under its ABL facility.\nFurthermore, production shutdowns will result in working capital swings which could result in increased outflows. As a result of the impacts of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and global supply chain disruptions, we may be required to raise additional capital, and our access to and cost of financing will depend on, among other things, global economic conditions, conditions in the global financing markets, the availability of sufficient amounts of financing, our prospects and our credit ratings. Such capital may not be available on favorable terms or at all.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to obtain financing in the future and to react to changes in our business.\nFor discussion of our debt and financing arrangements, including our senior term loan facility (\u201cTerm Loan Facility\u201d), 5.625% Senior Notes due 2026 (\u201cSenior Notes\u201d), 13.0% Senior Secured Notes due 2024 (\u201cSenior Secured Notes\u201d), our senior asset-based revolving credit facility (\u201cABL Facility\u201d) and debt of certain foreign subsidiaries, see \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources - Financing Arrangements\u201d in Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and Note 10. \u201cDebt\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8. \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Report.\nOur substantial amount of debt and our debt service obligations could limit our ability to satisfy our obligations, limit our ability to operate our business and impair our competitive position. For example, it could:\n\u2022make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations;\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and general industry conditions, including interest rate fluctuations, because a portion of our borrowings accrues interest at variable rates;\n\u2022require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our debt, which would reduce the availability of cash to fund working capital, capital expenditures or other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry;\n\u2022place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors that may have proportionately less debt;\n\u2022limit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing due to applicable financial and restrictive covenants in our debt agreements; and\n\u2022increase our cost of borrowing.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on our debt or to refinance these obligations depends on our financial condition, operating performance and our ability to generate cash in the future. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to\nfund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, sell material assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we may not be able to effect any of these actions, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our ability to restructure or refinance our indebtedness will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments, including the credit agreements governing the Term Loan Facility and the ABL Facility and the indentures governing the Senior Notes and the Senior Secured Notes, may limit or prevent us from taking any of these actions. In addition, a reduction of our credit rating could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. An inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, or to refinance or restructure our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would have an adverse effect, which could be material, on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as on our ability to satisfy our obligations in respect of the Term Loan Facility, the Senior Notes, the Senior Secured Notes, or the ABL Facility.\nAlthough the credit agreements governing the Term Loan Facility and the ABL Facility and the indentures governing the Senior Notes and the Senior Secured Notes contain certain limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, they do not prohibit us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness as defined therein. To the extent that we incur additional indebtedness or incur such other obligations that may be permitted under our debt instruments, the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness described above, including our potential inability to service our debt, will increase.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our indebtedness service obligations to increase significantly.\nThe borrowings under the ABL Facility and the Term Loan Facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, would correspondingly decrease.\nLIBOR and other interest rates that are indices deemed to be \u201cbenchmarks\u201d are the subject of recent and ongoing national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. Some of these reforms are already effective, while others are still to be implemented. These reforms may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past, to be replaced or disappear entirely, or have other consequences that cannot be predicted. Any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on our existing facilities or our future debt linked to such a \u201cbenchmark\u201d and our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest.\nOur debt instruments impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries.\nThe credit agreements governing the Term Loan Facility and the ABL Facility and the indentures governing the Senior Notes and the Senior Secured Notes impose significant operating and financial restrictions and limit our ability, among other things, to:\n\u2022incur, assume or permit to exist additional indebtedness (including guarantees thereof);\n\u2022pay dividends or certain other distributions on our capital stock or repurchase our capital stock or prepay subordinated indebtedness;\n\u2022incur liens on assets;\n\u2022make certain investments or other restricted payments;\n\u2022allow to exist certain restrictions on the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to us;\n\u2022engage in transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022alter the business that we conduct; and\n\u2022sell certain assets or merge or consolidate with or into other companies.\nMoreover, our ABL Facility provides the agent considerable discretion to impose reserves, which could materially reduce the amount of borrowings that would otherwise be available to us.\nAs a result of these covenants and restrictions (including borrowing base availability), we are limited in how we conduct our business, and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities or acquisitions. The terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants. We may not be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and, if we fail to do so, we may not be able to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants in such agreements. Our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants described above as well as others contained in our future debt instruments from time to time could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in our being required to repay these borrowings before their due date. If we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nIf there were an event of default under any of the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness whether as a result of a payment default, covenant breach or otherwise, the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately. Our assets or cash flow may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon occurrence of an event of default. Further, if we are unable to repay, refinance or restructure our indebtedness under our secured debt, the holders of such debt could exercise remedies against the collateral securing that indebtedness. In addition, any event of default or declaration of acceleration under one debt instrument could also result in an event of default under one or more of our other debt instruments. As a result, any default by us on our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nOur expected annual effective tax rate and cash tax liability could be volatile and could materially change as a result of changes in many items including mix of earnings, debt and capital structure and other factors.\nMany items could impact our effective tax rate and cash tax liability including changes in our debt and capital structure, mix of earnings and many other factors. Our overall effective tax rate is based upon the consolidated tax expense as a percentage of consolidated earnings before tax. However, tax expenses and benefits are not recognized on a consolidated or global basis, but rather on a jurisdictional, legal entity basis. Further, certain jurisdictions in which we operate generate losses where no current financial statement tax benefit is realized. In addition, certain jurisdictions have statutory rates greater than or less than the United States statutory rate. As such, changes in the mix and source of earnings between jurisdictions could have a significant impact on our overall effective tax rate and cash tax liability in future years. Changes in rules related to accounting for income taxes, changes in tax laws and rates or adverse outcomes from tax audits that occur regularly in any of our jurisdictions could also have a significant impact on our overall effective tax rate and cash tax liability in future periods.\nOur working capital requirements may negatively affect our liquidity and capital resources.\nOur working capital requirements can vary significantly, depending in part on the level, variability and timing of our customers\u2019 worldwide vehicle production and the payment terms with our customers and suppliers. If our working capital needs exceed our cash provided by operating activities, we would look to our cash balances and availability under our borrowing arrangements to satisfy those needs, as well as potential sources of additional capital, which may not be available on satisfactory terms and in adequate amounts, if at all.\nForeign currency exchange rate fluctuations could materially impact our operating results.\nOur sales and manufacturing operations outside the United States expose us to currency risks. For our consolidated financial statements, our sales and earnings denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars. This translation is calculated based on average exchange rates during the reporting period. Accordingly, our reported international sales and earnings could be adversely impacted in periods of a strengthening U.S. dollar.\nAlthough we generally produce in the same geographic region as our products are sold, we also produce in countries that predominately sell in another currency. Further, some of our commodities are purchased in or tied to the U.S. dollar; therefore our earnings could be adversely impacted during the periods of a strengthening U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies. While we employ financial instruments to hedge certain portions of our foreign currency exposures, our efforts to manage these risks may not be successful and may not completely insulate us from the effects of currency fluctuation.\nImpairment charges relating to our goodwill, long-lived assets or intangible assets could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe regularly monitor our goodwill, long-lived assets and intangible assets for impairment indicators. In conducting our goodwill impairment testing, we compare the fair value of our reporting units to their related net book value. In conducting our impairment analysis of long-lived and intangible assets, we compare the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the long-lived or intangible assets to the related net book values. Changes in economic or operating conditions impacting our estimates and assumptions could result in the impairment of our goodwill, long-lived assets or intangible assets. In the event that\nwe determine that our goodwill, long-lived assets or intangible assets are impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nCertain of our pension plans are currently underfunded, and we may have to make cash contributions to the plans, reducing the cash available for our business.\nWe sponsor various pension plans worldwide that are underfunded and will require cash contributions. Additionally, if the performance of the assets in our pension plans does not meet our expectations, or if other actuarial assumptions are modified, our required contributions may be higher than we expect. As of December 31, 2021, our U.S. pension plans were overfunded by $16.3 million and our non-U.S. pension plans were underfunded by $116.9 million. If our cash flow from operations is insufficient to fund our worldwide pension liabilities, it could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nSignificant changes in discount rates, the actual return on pension assets and other factors could adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur earnings may be positively or negatively impacted by the amount of income or expense recorded related to our pension plans. Generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d) require that income or expense related to the pension plans be calculated at the annual measurement date using actuarial calculations, which reflect certain assumptions. Because these assumptions have fluctuated and will continue to fluctuate in response to changing market conditions, the amount of gains or losses that will be recognized in subsequent periods, the impact on the funded status of the pension plans and the future minimum required contributions, if any, could adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure to maintain effective controls and procedures could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulatory provisions governing the financial reporting of U.S. public companies require that we establish and maintain disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting across our operations in 21 countries. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives; as such, they can be susceptible to human error, circumvention or override, and fraud. Failure to maintain adequate, effective controls and procedures could result in potential financial misstatements or other forms of noncompliance that could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition or organizational reputation.\nWe operate as a holding company and depend on our subsidiaries for cash to satisfy the obligations of the holding company.\nCooper-Standard Holdings Inc. is a holding company. Our subsidiaries conduct all of our operations and own substantially all of our assets. Our cash flow and our ability to meet our obligations depend on the cash flow of our subsidiaries. In addition, the payment of funds in the form of dividends, intercompany payments, tax sharing payments and otherwise may be subject to restrictions under the laws of the countries of incorporation of our subsidiaries or their governing documents.\nWe may not be able to procure insurance at reasonable rates to fully meet our needs.\nIntegral to our risk management strategy and due to requirements under certain of our contracts, we procure insurance coverage from third party insurers. There can be no assurance that any of our existing insurance coverage will be renewable upon the expiration of the coverage period or that future coverage will be affordable at needed limits. Such circumstances will lead to an increase in both our overall risk exposure and our operational expenses, disrupt the management of our business, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of our operations.\nLegal and Compliance Risks\nWe are involved from time to time in legal and regulatory proceedings, claims or investigations which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are involved in legal and regulatory proceedings, claims or investigations that, from time to time, may be significant. These matters typically arise in the normal course of business including, without limitation, commercial or contractual disputes, including warranty claims and other disputes with customers and suppliers; intellectual property matters; personal injury claims; environmental issues; tax matters; employment matters; antitrust matters; anti-corruption matters; or allegations relating to legal compliance by us or our employees.\nFor further information regarding our legal matters, see Item 3. \u201cLegal Proceedings.\u201d The industries in which we operate are also periodically reviewed or investigated by regulators, which could lead to enforcement actions, fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims. It is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of claims, investigations and\nlawsuits, and we could in the future incur judgments, fines or penalties or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition in any particular period.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property or if a third party challenges our intellectual property rights, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe own or have rights to proprietary technology that is important to our business. We rely on intellectual property laws, patents, trademarks and trade secrets to protect such technology. Such protections, however, vary among the countries in which we market and sell our products, and as a result, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without authorization. Any infringement or misappropriation of our technology could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We also face exposure to claims by others for infringement of intellectual property rights and could incur significant costs or losses related to such claims. In addition, many of our supply agreements require us to indemnify our customers from third-party infringement claims. These claims, regardless of their merit or resolution, are frequently costly to prosecute, defend or settle and divert the efforts and attention of our management and employees. If any such claim were to result in an adverse outcome, we could be required to take actions which may include: ceasing the manufacture, use or sale of the infringing products; paying substantial damages to third parties, including to customers to compensate them for the discontinued use of a product or to replace infringing technology with non-infringing technology; or expending significant resources to develop or license non-infringing products, any of which could adversely affect our operations, business and financial condition.\nWe may be adversely affected by laws and regulations, including environmental, health and safety laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local, and non-U.S. laws and regulations, including those related to environmental, health and safety, financial, tax, customs and other matters. We cannot predict the substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulations, or the application thereof. The introduction of new laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations, or the interpretations thereof, could increase the costs of doing business for us or our customers or suppliers or restrict our actions and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn particular, we are subject to a broad range of laws and regulations governing emissions to air; discharges to water; noise and odor emissions; the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment, reclamation and disposal of chemicals and waste materials; the cleanup of contaminated properties; and health and safety. We may incur substantial costs in complying with these laws and regulations. Many of our current and former facilities have been subject to certain environmental investigations and remediation activities, and we maintain environmental reserves for certain of these sites. Through various acquisitions, we have acquired a number of manufacturing facilities, and we cannot assure that we will not incur material costs or liabilities relating to activities that predate our ownership. Material future expenditures may be necessary if compliance standards change or material unknown conditions that require remediation are discovered. Environmental laws could also restrict our ability to expand our facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses. In addition, climate change poses regulatory risks that could harm our results of operations or affect the way we conduct our businesses. For example, new or modified regulations could require us to spend substantial funds to enhance our environmental compliance efforts. If we fail to comply with present and future environmental laws and regulations, we could be subject to future liabilities, which could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.", "PERMNO": 14185, "SIC": 3714, "TIC": "CPS"}
