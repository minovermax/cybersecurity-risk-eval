{"cik": "1513856", "company": "Neurotrope, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A: Risk Factors.\nAn investment in shares of our common stock is highly speculative and involves a high degree of risk. We face a variety of risks that may affect our operations and financial results and many of those risks are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict. Before investing in our common stock you should carefully consider the following risks, together with the financial and other information contained in this report. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our common stock would likely decline and you may lose all or a part of your investment. Only those investors who can bear the risk of loss of their entire investment should invest in our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Financial Condition\nWe will need additional financing to continue our operations. If we are unable to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms, we will need to curtail or cease our development plans and operations.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $8 million of available cash and cash equivalents. We expect that our operating expenses over the next several years will increase as we expand our research and development activities, personnel, facilities, and infrastructure. We are currently reviewing our current operating plans, and we will require additional capital soon. Additional funds may be raised through the issuance of equity securities and/or debt financing, there being no assurance that any type of financing on terms acceptable to us will be available or otherwise occur. Debt financing must be repaid regardless of whether we generate revenues or cash flows from operations and may be secured by substantially all of our assets. Any equity financing or debt financing that requires the issuance of warrants or other equity securities to the lender would cause the percentage ownership by our current stockholders to be diluted, which dilution may be substantial. Also, any additional equity securities issued may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders. Any equity financing at a price below the then current conversion price of our Series A Preferred Stock will result in an adjustment to the conversion ratio, applicable to our Series A Preferred Stock, resulting in the issuance of additional shares of our common stock upon the conversion of our Series A Preferred Stock, which would further dilute our other stockholders. If such financing is not available when required or is not available on acceptable terms, we may be required to reduce or eliminate certain product candidates and development activities related to bryostatin, the \u201cbryologs\u201d or PUFA (as defined above) analogs (as described in \u201cBusiness\u201d above) and it may ultimately require us to suspend or cease operations, which could cause investors to lose the entire amount of their investment.\nOur ongoing viability as a company depends on our ability to successfully develop and commercialize our licensed technology.\nWe are principally focused on developing two product platforms, a drug, bryostatin, for the treatment of AD and our diagnostic test for the detection of AD, both of which are still in the clinical testing stage and have not yet been fully developed. Our potential success is highly uncertain since both of our principal product candidates are in development. Bryostatin and other product candidates are also subject to regulatory approval. Our potential success depends upon our ability to complete development and successfully commercialize in a timely manner bryostatin for the treatment of AD and the diagnostic test for AD. We must develop bryostatin, successfully test it for safety and efficacy in the targeted patient population and manufacture the finished dosage form on a commercial scale to meet regulatory standards and receive regulatory approvals. The development and commercialization process is both time-consuming and costly, and involves a high degree of business risk. Bryostatin is still at an early stage in its product development cycle, and any follow-on product candidates are still at the concept stage. In order to make our diagnostic test for AD commercially available, we must make investments to upgrade BRNI\u2019s laboratory facilities or contract with a third-party lab for the processing of the diagnostic test. The results of clinical testing of our product candidates are uncertain and we cannot assure anybody that we will be able to obtain regulatory approvals of our product candidates. If obtained, regulatory approvals may take longer or be more expensive than anticipated. Furthermore, even if regulatory approvals are obtained, our products may not perform as we expect and we may not be able to successfully and profitably produce and market any products. Delays in any part of the process or our inability to obtain regulatory approval of our products could adversely affect our future operating results by restricting (or even prohibiting) the introduction and sale of our products.\nIf the BRNI License were terminated, we may be required to cease operations.\nOur rights to develop, commercialize and sell certain of our proposed products, including bryostatin and our diagnostic test for the detection of AD, are, in part, dependent upon the BRNI License. BRNI has the right to terminate this agreement after 30 days prior notice in certain circumstances, including if we were to materially breach any provisions of the agreement after a 60-day cure period for breaches that are capable of being cured, in the event of certain bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings or in the event of the termination of the Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement, or the Common Stockholders Agreement, dated August 23, 2013, with respect to the Company. Additionally, the BRNI License provides that the license may not be assigned, including by means of a change of control of the Company, or sublicensed without the consent of BRNI. For additional information regarding the BRNI License, see \u201cBusiness-Intellectual Property-Technology License and Services Agreement.\u201d If the BRNI License were terminated, we would lose rights to a substantial portion of the intellectual property currently being developed by us and no longer have the rights to develop, commercialize and sell some of our proposed products. As a result, we may be required to cease operations under such circumstance.\nWe currently rely on BRNI, and may also rely on other independent third-party contract research organizations, to perform clinical and non-clinical studies of our drug candidate and diagnostic test and to perform other research and development services.\nThe BRNI License requires us to use BRNI to provide research and development services and other scientific assistance and support services, including clinical trials, under certain conditions. The BRNI License limits our ability to make certain decisions, including those relating to our drug candidate and diagnostic test, without BRNI\u2019s consent. See \u201cBusiness-Intellectual Property-Technology License and Services Agreement.\u201d Under certain conditions, we may, however, also rely on independent third-party contract research organizations, or a CRO, to perform clinical and non-clinical studies of our drug candidate and diagnostic test. Many important aspects of the services that may be performed for us by CROs would be out of our direct control. If there were to be any dispute or disruption in our relationship with such CROs, the development of our drug candidate and diagnostic test may be delayed. Moreover, in our regulatory submissions, we would expect to rely on the quality and validity of the clinical work performed by our CROs. If any of our CROs\u2019 processes, methodologies or results were determined to be invalid or inadequate, our own clinical data and results and related regulatory approvals could be materially adversely impacted.\nWe have relied on the representations and materials provided by BRNI, including scientific, peer-reviewed and non-peer reviewed publications, abstracts, slides, internal documents, verbal communications, patents and related patent filings, with respect to the results of its research related to our proposed products.\nBRNI began the development of the intellectual property that forms the basis for our proposed products in 1999. We have relied on the quality and validity of the research results obtained by BRNI with respect to this intellectual property, and we have conducted limited verification of the raw preclinical and clinical data produced by BRNI. No independent third-party has verified any such data. Some of BRNI\u2019s results have been included in this report. If any of BRNI\u2019s basic processes, methodologies or results were determined to be invalid or inadequate, our own clinical data and results and related regulatory approvals, could be materially adversely impacted.\nWe have a limited operating history upon which investors can evaluate our future prospects.\nOur product candidates are in an early development stage and we are subject to all of the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise. While development of our product candidates was started in 1999 by BRNI, Neurotrope BioScience was incorporated on October 31, 2012 and on that same date entered into the Technology License and Services Agreement with BRNI and NRV II, LLC for the continuing development and commercialization of our product candidates, and therefore we have a limited operating history. Our proposed products are currently in the research and development stage and we have not generated any revenues, nor do we expect our products to generate revenues for the near term, if ever. As a result, any investment in our securities must be evaluated in light of the potential problems, delays, uncertainties and complications encountered in connection with a newly established pharmaceutical development business. The risks include, but are not limited to, the possibilities that any or all of our potential products will be found to be unsafe, ineffective or, that the products once developed, although effective, are not economical to market; that our competitors hold proprietary rights that preclude us from marketing such products; that our competitors market a superior or equivalent product; or the failure to receive necessary regulatory clearances for our proposed products. To achieve profitable operations, we must successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for, introduce and successfully market at a profit product candidates that are currently in the research and development phase. We only have two product candidates in clinical development. Much of the clinical development work and testing for our product candidates remains to be completed. No assurance can be given that our research and development efforts will be successful, that required regulatory approvals will be obtained, that any of our candidates will be safe and effective, that any products, if developed and introduced, will be successfully marketed or achieve market acceptance or that products will be marketed at prices necessary to generate profits. Failure to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approvals for, or introduce and market our products would have material adverse effects on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we do not obtain the necessary regulatory approvals in the United States and/or other countries, we will not be able to sell our drug candidates.\nWe cannot assure you that we will receive the approvals necessary to commercialize bryostatin, or any other potential drug candidates we acquire or attempt to develop in the future. We will need approval from the FDA to commercialize our drug candidates in the U.S. and approvals from similar regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions to commercialize our drug candidates in those jurisdictions. In order to obtain FDA approval of bryostatin or any other drug candidate for the treatment of AD, we must submit an NDA to the FDA, demonstrating that the drug candidate is safe, pure and potent, and effective for its intended use. This demonstration requires significant research including completion of clinical trials. Satisfaction of the FDA\u2019s regulatory requirements typically takes many years, depending upon the type, complexity and novelty of the drug candidate and requires substantial resources for research, development and testing. We cannot predict whether our clinical trials will demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our drug candidates or if the results of any clinical trials will be sufficient to advance to the next phase of development or for approval from the FDA. We also cannot predict whether our research and clinical approaches will result in drugs or therapeutics that the FDA considers safe and effective for the proposed indications. The FDA has substantial discretion in the drug approval process. The approval process may be delayed by changes in government regulation, future legislation or administrative action or changes in FDA policy that occur prior to or during our regulatory review. Delays in obtaining regulatory approvals may prevent or delay commercialization of, and our ability to derive revenues from, our drug candidates and diminish any competitive advantages that we may otherwise believe that we hold. Even if we comply with all FDA requests, the FDA may ultimately reject one or more of our applications. We may never obtain regulatory clearance for any of our drug candidates. Failure to obtain FDA approval of our drug candidates will leave us without a saleable product and therefore without any source of revenues. In addition, the FDA may require us to conduct additional clinical testing or to perform post-marketing studies, as a condition to granting marketing approval of a drug product or permit continued marketing, if previously approved. If conditional marketing approval is obtained, the results generated after approval could result in loss of marketing approval, changes in product labeling, and/or new or increased concerns about the side effects or efficacy of a product. The FDA has significant post-market authority, including the explicit authority to require post-market studies and clinical trials, labeling changes based on new safety information and compliance with FDA-approved risk evaluation and mitigation strategies. The FDA\u2019s exercise of its authority has in some cases resulted, and in the future could result, in delays or increased costs during product development, clinical trials and regulatory review, increased costs to comply with additional post-approval regulatory requirements and potential restrictions on sales of approved drugs. In foreign jurisdictions, the regulatory approval processes generally include the same or similar risks as those associated with the FDA approval procedures described above. We cannot assure you that we will receive the approvals necessary to commercialize our drug candidates for sale either within or outside the United States.\nIf we are unable to engage a CLIA-certified lab to process our diagnostic test at its facilities, the commercialization of our diagnostic test may be unsuccessful.\nWe are obligated to develop an AD diagnostic product pursuant to the terms of the February 2015 SOW. We have conducted analyses of our AD diagnostic technology and are continuing to conduct market research to evaluate physician acceptability, commercial sales potential and product development costs of an AD diagnostic product. We believe that if we develop a diagnostic test that is solely available through a single CLIA-certified lab, we may market the diagnostic test as an LDT and fall within the FDA\u2019s enforcement discretion policy for such tests. Under historic FDA enforcement policies and guidance, LDTs such as this generally did not require FDA premarket clearance or approval before commercialization, and we plan to market our test on that basis. FDA guidance and policy pertaining to diagnostic testing, however, is continuing to evolve and is subject to ongoing review and revision. A significant change in FDA guidance and policy may trigger FDA oversight of any diagnostic test we develop and offer through a single CLIA-certified lab. If we are unable to contract with a CLIA-certified lab for the processing of our diagnostic test, we may not be able to market the test as an LDT, which could result in substantial delays in the commercialization of our diagnostic test. We have supported the progress of BRNI\u2019s facility located in Rockville, Maryland towards becoming a CLIA-accredited facility; however, there is no guarantee that this facility will achieve this certification in the timeframe required for commercial introduction of an AD diagnostic product.\nIf the FDA requires approval or clearance of our diagnostic test, we could incur substantial costs and time delays associated with meeting requirements for pre-market clearance or approval.\nAlthough the FDA maintains that it has authority to regulate the development and use of LDTs, such as ours, as medical devices, it has not exercised its authority with respect to most LDTs as a matter of enforcement discretion. The FDA does not generally extend its enforcement discretion to reagents or software provided by third parties and used to perform LDTs, and therefore these products must typically comply with FDA medical device regulations, which are wide-ranging and govern, among other things: product design and development, product testing, product labeling, product storage, pre-market clearance or approval, advertising and promotion and product sales and distribution.\nWe believe that a diagnostic test utilized in a single CLIA-certified laboratory falls within the FDA\u2019s current enforcement discretion policy for diagnostic tests. As a result, we believe that pursuant to the FDA\u2019s current policies and guidance, the FDA, in its discretion, would not require that we obtain regulatory clearances or approvals for this type of AD test. The container we provide for collection and transport of biopsy samples from a pathology laboratory to our clinical reference laboratory may be a medical device subject to FDA regulation but, we believe, would not receive pre-market review by the FDA because under current policy and guidance we expect the FDA to exercise its discretion not to enforce the requirement. We cannot assure you that the FDA or other regulatory agencies would agree with our determination. A determination that we have violated these laws or a public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of these laws could adversely affect our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nMoreover, FDA guidance and policy pertaining to diagnostic testing is continuing to evolve and is subject to ongoing review and revision. A significant change in any of the laws, regulations or policies may require us to change our business model in order to maintain regulatory compliance. At various times since 2006, the FDA has issued guidance documents or announced draft guidance regarding initiatives that may require varying levels of FDA oversight of our test. For example, in June 2010, the FDA announced a public meeting to discuss the agency\u2019s oversight of LDTs prompted by the increased complexity of LDTs and their increasingly important role in clinical decision-making and disease management, particularly in the context of personalized medicine. The FDA indicated that it was considering a risk-based application of oversight to LDTs and that, following public input and discussion, it might issue separate draft guidance on the regulation of LDTs, which ultimately could require that we seek and obtain either pre-market clearance or approval of LDTs, depending upon the risk-based approach the FDA adopts. On October 3, 2014, the FDA published a proposed risk-based framework for LDTs, which are designed, manufactured, and used within a single laboratory. This draft guidance indicates that the FDA would like to establish an LDT oversight framework, including premarket review for higher-risk LDTs, such as those that have the same intended use as FDA-approved or cleared companion diagnostics currently on the market. The FDA\u2019s notice states that it does not consider devices to be LDTs if they are designed or manufactured completely, or partly, outside of the laboratory that offers and uses them. This includes instances in which an academic institution develops a device, which it then licenses to or signs an exclusivity agreement (to manufacturer and use the device) with a private corporation that owns a CLIA-certified laboratory. It also includes instances in which a laboratory contracts with a specification developer to design a new device and transfer the design to the laboratory for final validation prior to the device being manufactured and used by the laboratory. The FDA\u2019s draft guidance, if and when finalized, may significantly impact the development and commercialization of our products, and may require us to change our business model in order to maintain compliance with these laws. We cannot predict the ultimate timing or form of any FDA guidance or regulation addressing LDTs.\nIf the FDA significantly changes the regulation of LDTs, it could reduce our projected revenue or increase our projected costs and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations or financial condition. We cannot provide any assurance that FDA regulation, including pre-market review, will not be required in the future for our tests, whether through additional guidance issued by the FDA, new enforcement policies adopted by the FDA or new legislation enacted by Congress. We believe it is possible that legislation will be enacted into law or guidance could be issued by the FDA which may result in increased regulatory burdens for us to offer a diagnostic test.\nThe requirement of pre-market review could negatively affect our business until such review is completed and clearance to market or approval is obtained. The FDA could require that we stop selling our tests pending pre-market clearance or approval. We may be required to proactively achieve compliance with certain FDA regulations and to conform our manufacturing operations to the FDA\u2019s good manufacturing practice regulations for medical devices, known as the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, as part of our contracts with customers or as part of our collaborations with third parties. In addition, we may voluntarily seek to conform our manufacturing operations to QSR requirements. For clinical diagnostic products that are regulated as medical devices, the FDA enforces the QSR through pre-approved inspections and periodic unannounced inspections of registered manufacturing facilities. If we are subject to QSR requirements, the failure to comply with those requirements or take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse QSR inspection could result in enforcement actions, including a public warning letter or an untitled letter, a delay in approving or clearing, or a refusal to approve or clear, our products, a shutdown of manufacturing operations, a product recall, civil or criminal penalties or other sanctions, which could in turn cause our sales and business to suffer.\nIf the FDA allows our test to remain on the market but there is uncertainty about our tests, if they are labeled investigational by the FDA or if labeling claims the FDA allows us to make are very limited, orders or reimbursement may decline. The regulatory approval process may involve, among other things, successfully completing additional clinical trials and making a 510(k) submission, or filing a pre-market approval application with the FDA. If the FDA requires pre-market review, our tests may not be cleared or approved on a timely basis, if at all. We may also decide voluntarily to pursue FDA pre-market review of our tests if we determine that doing so would be appropriate.\nIf we were required to conduct additional clinical trials prior to continuing to offer our diagnostic test, those trials could lead to delays or failure to obtain necessary regulatory approval, which could cause significant delays in commercializing the product candidate and harm our ability to generate revenue.\nWe have not generated any revenues since our inception and we do not expect to generate revenue for the foreseeable future. If we do not generate revenues and achieve profitability, we will likely need to curtail or cease our development plans and operations.\nOur ability to generate revenues depends upon many factors, including our ability to complete development of our proposed products, our ability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals for our proposed products and our ability to successfully commercialize market and sell our products. We have not generated any revenues since we began operations on October 31, 2012. We expect to incur significant operating losses over the next several years. If we do not generate revenues, do not achieve profitability and do not have other sources of financing for our business, we will likely need to curtail or cease our development plans and operations, which could cause investors to lose the entire amount of their investment.\nOur commercial success will depend, in part, on our ability, and the ability of our licensors, to obtain and maintain patent protection. Our licensors\u2019 failure to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nPursuant to the BRNI License, we have obtained rights to certain patents owned by BRNI or licensed to NRV II, LLC by BRNI as of or subsequent to October 31, 2012. For additional information regarding the BRNI License, see \u201cBusiness-Intellectual Property-Technology License and Services Agreement.\u201d In the future, we may seek rights from third parties to other patents or patent applications. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability and the ability of our licensors to maintain and/or obtain and enforce patent protection for our proposed products and to preserve our trade secrets, and to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. Patent positions in the field of biotechnology and pharmaceuticals are generally highly uncertain and involve complex legal and scientific questions. We cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first inventors of inventions covered by our licensed patents or that we or they were the first to file. Accordingly, the patents licensed to us may not be valid or afford us protection against competitors with similar technology. The failure to maintain and/or obtain patent protection on the technologies underlying our proposed products may have material adverse effects on our competitive position and business prospects.\nOur licensed patented technologies may infringe on other patents, which may expose us to costly litigation.\nIt is possible that our licensed patented technologies may infringe on patents or other rights owned by others. We may have to alter our products or processes, pay additional licensing fees, pay to defend an infringement action or challenge the validity of the patents in court or cease activities altogether because of patent rights of third parties, thereby causing additional unexpected costs and delays to us. Patent litigation is costly and time consuming, and we may not have sufficient resources to pay for such litigation. Pursuant to the BRNI License, BRNI has the exclusive right (but not the obligation) to apply for, file, prosecute or maintain patents and patent applications for our licensed technologies. However, in order to maintain our rights to use our licensed technologies, we must reimburse BRNI for all of the attorney\u2019s fees and other costs and expenses related to any of the foregoing. For additional information regarding the BRNI License, see \u201cBusiness-Intellectual Property-Technology License and Services Agreement.\u201d If the patents licensed to us are determined to infringe a patent owned by a third party and we do not obtain a license under such third-party patents, or if we are found liable for infringement or are not able to have such third-party patents declared invalid, we may be liable for significant money damages, we may encounter significant delays in bringing products to market or we may be precluded from participating in the manufacture, use or sale of products or methods of treatment requiring such licenses.\nWe may not be able to protect our trade secrets and other unpatented proprietary technologies, which could give our competitors an advantage over us.\nIn addition to our reliance on patents and pending patents owned by BRNI, we rely upon trade secrets and other unpatented proprietary technologies. We may not be able to adequately protect our rights with regard to such unpatented proprietary technologies or competitors may independently develop substantially equivalent technologies. We seek to protect trade secrets and proprietary knowledge, in part through confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators. Nevertheless, these agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of our confidential information and may not provide us with an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of such information and, as a result, our competitors could gain a competitive advantage over us.\nWe are dependent on Charles S. Ramat, our President and Chief Executive Officer, for the successful execution of our business plan. The loss of Mr. Ramat or other key members of our management team could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects.\nWe are highly dependent on Charles S. Ramat, our President and Chief Executive Officer. We are dependent on Charles S. Ramat\u2019s and our directors\u2019 networks of contacts and experience to recruit key talent to the Company. We do not have key-man insurance on any of our officers. Loss of the services of Charles S. Ramat or other key members of our management team or our Board of Director\u2019s ability to identify and hire key talent could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to hire additional qualified personnel our business prospects may suffer.\nOur success and achievement of our business plans depend upon our ability to recruit, hire, train and retain other highly qualified technical and managerial personnel. Competition for qualified employees among pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies is intense, and the loss of any of such persons, or an inability to attract, retain and motivate any additional highly skilled employees required for the implementation of our business plans and activities could have a materially adverse effect on us. Our inability to attract and retain the necessary technical and managerial personnel and consultants and scientific and/or regulatory consultants and advisors could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to in-license or acquire new development-stage products or technologies.\nOur product commercialization strategy relies, to some extent, on our ability to in-license or acquire product formulation techniques, new chemical entities, or related know-how that has proprietary protection. We may also seek to acquire, by license or otherwise, other development stage products that are consistent with our product portfolio objectives and commercialization strategy. The acquisition of products requires the identification of appropriate candidates, negotiation of terms of acquisition, financing for the acquisition and integration of the candidates into our portfolio. Failure to accomplish any of these tasks may diminish our growth rate and adversely alter our competitive position.\nWe are dependent upon the NCI to supply bryostatin for our clinical trials.\nBRNI has entered into a material transfer agreement with the NCI, pursuant to which the NCI has agreed to supply bryostatin required for our pre-clinical research and clinical trials. This agreement does not provide for a sufficient amount of bryostatin to support the completion of our clinical trials that we are required to conduct in order to seek FDA approval of bryostatin for the treatment of AD. Therefore, BRNI or we will have to enter into one or more subsequent agreements with the NCI for the supply of additional amounts of bryostatin. If BRNI or we are unable to secure such additional agreements or if the NCI otherwise discontinues for any reason supplying us with bryostatin, then we would have to either secure another source of bryostatin or discontinue our efforts to develop and commercialize bryostatin for the treatment of AD. There can be no assurance that we will be able to secure future bryostatin supplies from any source on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nWe expect to rely on third parties to manufacture our proposed products and, as a result, we may not be able to control our product development or commercialization.\nWe currently do not have an FDA approved manufacturing facility. We expect to rely on contract manufacturers to produce quantities of products and substances necessary for product commercialization. See also the risk factor above captioned \u201cWe are dependent upon the NCI to supply bryostatin for our clinical trials.\u201d Contract manufacturers that we use must adhere to current good manufacturing practice regulations enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program. If the facilities of such manufacturers cannot pass a pre-approval plant inspection, the FDA pre-market approval of our products will not be granted. As a result:\n\u00b7 there are a limited number of manufacturers that could produce the products for us and we may not be able to identify and enter into acceptable agreements with any manufacturers;\n\u00b7 the products may not be produced at costs or in quantities necessary to make them commercially viable;\n\u00b7 the quality of the products may not be acceptable to us and/or regulatory authorities;\n\u00b7 our manufacturing partners may go out of business or file for bankruptcy;\n\u00b7 our manufacturing partners may decide not to manufacture our products for us;\n\u00b7 our manufacturing partners could fail to manufacture to our specifications;\n\u00b7 there could be delays in the delivery of quantities needed;\n\u00b7 we could be unable to fulfill our commercial needs in the event we obtain regulatory approvals and there is strong market demand; or\n\u00b7 ongoing inspections by the FDA or other regulatory authorities may result in suspensions, seizures, recalls, fines, injunctions, revocations and/or criminal prosecutions.\nIf we are unable to engage contract manufacturers or suppliers to manufacture or package our products, or if we are unable to contract for a sufficient supply of required products and substances on acceptable terms, or if we encounter delays or difficulties in our relationships with these manufacturers, or with a regulatory agency, then the submission of products for regulatory approval and subsequent sales of such products would be delayed. Any such delay may have a materially adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may rely on third parties for marketing and sales and our revenue prospects may depend on their efforts.\nWe currently have no experience in sales, marketing or distribution. We do not anticipate having the resources in the foreseeable future to allocate to the sales and marketing of our proposed products. As a result if our product development is successful, our future success will likely depend, in part, on our ability to enter into and maintain collaborative relationships with one or more third parties for sales, marketing or distribution, on the collaborator\u2019s strategic interest in the products we have under development and on such collaborator\u2019s ability to successfully market and sell any such products. We intend to pursue collaborative arrangements regarding the sales and marketing of our products as appropriate. However, we may not be able to establish or maintain such collaborative arrangements or, if we are able to do so, they may not have effective sales forces. To the extent that we decide not to, or are unable to, enter into collaborative arrangements with respect to the sales and marketing of our proposed products, significant capital expenditures, management resources and time will be required to establish and develop an in-house marketing and sales force with technical expertise. To the extent that we depend on third parties for marketing and distribution, any revenues received by us will depend upon the efforts of such third parties, which may not be successful.\nIf our products are not accepted by patients, the medical community or health insurance companies, our business prospects will suffer.\nCommercial sales of any products we successfully develop will substantially depend upon the products\u2019 efficacy and on their acceptance by patients, the medical community, providers of comprehensive healthcare insurance, healthcare benefit plan managers, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS (which is the U.S. federal agency which administers Medicare, Medicaid and the State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program), and other organizations. Widespread acceptance of our products will require educating patients, the medical community and third party payors of medical treatments as to the benefits and reliability of the products. Our proposed products may not be accepted, and, even if they are accepted, we are unable to estimate the length of time it would take to gain such acceptance.\nThe branded prescription segment of the pharmaceutical industry in which we operate is competitive, and we are particularly subject to the risks of such competition.\nThe branded prescription segment of the pharmaceutical industry in which we operate is competitive, in part, because the products that are sold require extensive sales and marketing resources invested in their commercialization. The increasing cost of prescription pharmaceuticals has caused providers of comprehensive healthcare insurance, healthcare benefit plan managers, CMS, as well as other organizations, collectively known as third party payors, to tightly control and dictate their drug formulary plans to control the costs associated with the use of prescription pharmaceutical products by enrollees in these plans. Our ability to gain formulary access to drug plans supported by these third party payors is substantially dependent on the differentiated patient benefit that our proposed products can provide, compared closely to similar products claiming the same benefits or advantages. We may not be able to differentiate our proposed products from those of our competitors, successfully develop or introduce new products that are less costly or offer better performance than those of our competitors, or offer purchasers of our proposed products payment and other commercial terms as favorable as those offered by our competitors. We expect that some of our proposed products, even if successfully developed and commercialized, will eventually face competition from a significant number of biotechnology or large pharmaceutical companies. Because most of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have, we are particularly subject to the risks inherent in competing with them. The effects of this competition could materially adversely affect our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are developing our product candidates to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of AD. Our competition will be determined in part by the potential indications for which drugs are developed and ultimately approved by regulatory authorities. Additionally, the timing of market introduction of some of our potential products or of competitors\u2019 products may be an important competitive factor. Accordingly, the relative speed with which we can develop our product candidates, complete preclinical testing, clinical trials and approval processes and supply commercial quantities to market are expected to be important competitive factors. We expect that competition among products approved for sale will be based on various factors, including product efficacy, safety, reliability, availability, price and patent position.\nOur business will expose us to potential product liability risks, which could result in significant product liability exposure.\nOur business will expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the testing, designing, manufacturing and marketing of human diagnostic and therapeutic products. Product liability insurance in the pharmaceutical industry is generally expensive, and we may not be able to obtain or maintain product liability insurance in the future on acceptable terms or with adequate coverage against potential liabilities, if at all. A successful products liability claim brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nA successful clinical trial liability claim against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition even with such insurance coverage.\nOur business will expose us to potential liability that results from risks associated with conducting clinical trials of our product candidates. Although we have procured clinical trial product liability insurance coverage for our bryostatin product candidate with coverages and deductibles we believe are adequate, there is no guarantee that our coverage will be adequate to satisfy any liability we may incur. We do not currently have insurance with respect to any other product candidate. A successful clinical trial liability claim brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations even if we successfully obtain clinical trial insurance.\nA successful liability claim against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nOur business and actions can expose us to potential liability risks that are inherent in business, generally, and in the pharmaceutical industry, specifically. While we maintain commercial general liability insurance with coverages and deductibles we believe are adequate, there is no guarantee that our coverage will be adequate to satisfy any liability we may incur. A successful liability claim brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nReforms in the health care industry and the uncertainty associated with pharmaceutical and laboratory test pricing, reimbursement and related matters could adversely affect the marketing, pricing and demand for our products.\nPublic and private entities are seeking ways to reduce or contain increasing health care costs. All generic pharmaceutical manufacturers whose products are covered by the Medicaid program are required to rebate to each state a percentage of their \u201caverage manufacturer price\u201d for the products in question. The extension of prescription drug coverage to all Medicare recipients was approved by Congress several years ago. Numerous other proposals to curb rising pharmaceutical prices have also been introduced or proposed in Congress and in some state legislatures. We cannot predict the nature of the measures that may be adopted or their effect on our competitive position. Our ability to market our products depends, in part, on reimbursement levels for them and related treatment established by health care providers, private health insurers and other organizations, including health maintenance organizations and managed care organizations. In the event that governmental authorities enact additional legislation or adopt regulations that affect third party coverage and reimbursement, demand for our products may be reduced, which may materially adversely affect our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn April 2014, the President signed the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, or PAMA, which contained provisions that significantly affect Medicare payment for clinical laboratory tests that are reimbursed under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule or CLFS. Under PAMA, Medicare payment rates for tests will be based on the volume-weighted median of private payor payment rates for the test. Private payor payment amounts, adjusted for discounts and other price concessions, will be collected by laboratories, starting in 2016, and submitted to CMS so that market-based payment rates can be calculated. The payment rates calculated under PAMA will be effective starting January 1, 2017, and will be reviewed every three years, based on private payor payment rates and volumes for their tests. New tests will generally be paid using existing reimbursement methodologies known as cross-walking or gap filling. However, some new tests, termed Advanced Diagnostic Laboratory Tests, will be paid based on the laboratory\u2019s actual list charge for a brief period of time until private payor payment data is available. In order to facilitate implementation of the new payment methodology, starting in 2016, CMS is required to assign specific billing codes to many CLFS tests existing at the time of enactment and to all new CLFS tests. The Secretary of United States Department of Health and Human Services has discretion over many aspects of implementing PAMA, including determining which labs will be required to collect private payer payment information, which tests may be designated as Advanced Diagnostic Laboratory tests, and which existing laboratory tests will be assigned new billing codes; therefore, the impact of this law, if any, on Medicare payment for any potential diagnostic product we might develop and commercialize in the future is unclear. In the event that our potential diagnostic product is developed and commercialized, we believe that over time, our customers could see decreased reimbursement from Medicare in connection with the use of our potential diagnostic product. As a result, the price at which we may be able sell our potential diagnostic product may be impacted, and in turn, our revenue growth may be negatively impacted.\nPAMA also codified coverage rules for laboratory tests by requiring any local coverage determination to be made following the established procedures for development and appeals of local coverage determinations. PAMA also authorizes CMS to consolidate coverage policies for clinical laboratory tests among one to four laboratory-specific Medicare contractors. These same contractors may also be designated to process claims if CMS determines that such a model is appropriate.\nConsolidation in the pharmaceutical industry could materially affect our ability to operate as an independent entity.\nThe pressure to grow revenues while containing the escalating costs of basic research and development has resulted in an increase in mergers and acquisitions in our industry. More consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry is expected over the next five years. We could become an acquisition target by a larger competitor and, as a consequence, suffer serious disruptions to our business model or even lose control of our ability to operate as an independent entity. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our product development efforts or the commercialization of our proposed products.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThere currently is a limited public market for our common stock. Failure to develop or maintain an active trading market could negatively affect the value of our common stock and make it difficult or impossible for you to sell your shares.\nThere is currently a limited public market for shares of our common stock, and an active trading market may never develop or, if developed, may not be maintained. Our common stock is not listed on a stock exchange. Our common stock is quoted on the OTC Market. The OTC Market is a thinly traded market and lacks the liquidity of certain other public markets with which some investors may have more experience. The average daily trading volume in our common stock was approximately 26,000 shares during the 90-day period from December 20, 2014 to March 19, 2015. We do not currently and may not ever be able to satisfy the listing requirements for our common stock to be listed on a national securities exchange, which are often a more widely-traded and liquid market. Some, but not all, of the factors which may delay or prevent the listing of our common stock on a more widely-traded and liquid market include the following: our stockholders\u2019 equity may be insufficient; the market value of our outstanding securities may be too low; our net income from operations may be too low; our common stock may not be sufficiently widely held; we may not be able to secure market makers for our common stock; and we may fail to meet the rules and requirements mandated by the several exchanges and markets to have our common stock listed. Should we fail to satisfy the initial listing standards of the national exchanges, or our common stock is otherwise rejected for listing and remains listed on the OTC Market or suspended from the OTC Market, the trading price of our common stock could suffer and the trading market for our common stock may be less liquid and our common stock price may be subject to increased volatility.\nWe cannot assure you that our common stock will become liquid or that it will be listed on a securities exchange.\nUntil our common stock is listed on a national securities exchange, such as The New York Stock Exchange or The Nasdaq Stock Market, we expect our common stock to remain eligible for quotation on the OTC Market, or on another over-the-counter quotation system, or in the \u201cpink sheets.\u201d In those venues, however, an investor may find it difficult to obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our common stock. In addition, if we fail to meet the criteria set forth in SEC regulations, various requirements would be imposed by law on broker-dealers who sell our securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. Consequently, such regulations may deter broker-dealers from recommending or selling our common stock, which may further affect the liquidity of our common stock. This would also make it more difficult for us to raise capital.\nOur common stock is subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules of the SEC and the trading market in the securities is limited, which makes transactions in the stock cumbersome and may reduce the value of an investment in our common stock.\nThe SEC has adopted Rule 15g-9 which establishes the definition of a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d for the purposes relevant to us, as any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require:\n\u00b7 that a broker or dealer approve a person\u2019s account for transactions in penny stocks; and\n\u00b7 the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction, setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased.\nIn order to approve a person\u2019s account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must:\n\u00b7 obtain financial information and investment experience objectives of the person; and\n\u00b7 make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks.\nThe broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prescribed by the SEC relating to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form sets forth:\n\u00b7 the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination; and\n\u00b7 that the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction.\nGenerally, brokers and potential investors may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules. This may make it more difficult for existing stockholders to dispose of such securities and cause a decline in the market value of such securities.\nRule 15g-2 requires that disclosure has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading and about the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks. If we remain subject to the penny stock rules for any significant period, it could have an adverse effect on the market, if any, for our securities. If our securities are subject to the penny stock rules, investors will find it more difficult to dispose of our securities.\nVolatility in the price of our common stock could lead to losses by investors and costly securities litigation.\nThe trading price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could fluctuate in response to factors such as:\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated variations in our operating results;\n\u00b7 announcements of developments by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7 announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u00b7 adoption of new accounting standards affecting our industry;\n\u00b7 additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u00b7 sales of our common stock or other securities in the open market or in any publicized transaction;\n\u00b7 changes in our industry;\n\u00b7 regulatory and economic developments, including our ability to obtain working capital financing;\n\u00b7 shares of our common stock are saleable under Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and as a result, potential and actual sales of our common stock by our present stockholders may have a depressive effect on the price of our common stock in the marketplace;\n\u00b7 on August 29, 2014, we filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC, and as a result, potential and actual sales of our common stock by our present stockholders may have a depressive effect on the price of our common stock in the marketplace;\n\u00b7 on December 1, 2014, we filed a Registration Statement on Form S-1 (Registration No. 333- 200664) and on February 10, 2015, we filed two Pre-Effective Amendments to such Registration Statement with the SEC. The Registration Statement became effective on February 12, 2015, and as a result, potential and actual sales of our common stock by our present stockholders may have a depressive effect on the price of our common stock in the marketplace;\n\u00b7 our ability to execute our business plan;\n\u00b7 other events or factors, many of which are beyond our control; and\n\u00b7 announcement of clinical trial results.\nThe stock market is subject to significant price and volume fluctuations. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been initiated against the public company. Litigation initiated against us, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, which could harm our business and financial condition.\nWe do not anticipate dividends to be paid on our common stock, and investors may lose the entire amount of their investment.\nCash dividends have never been declared or paid on our common stock, and we do not anticipate such a declaration or payment for the foreseeable future. We expect to use future earnings, if any, to fund business growth. Therefore, stockholders will not likely receive any funds absent a sale of their shares. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because a return on your investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates. We cannot assure stockholders of a positive return on their investment when they sell their shares, nor can we assure that stockholders will not lose the entire amount of their investment.\nIf securities analysts do not initiate coverage or continue to cover our common stock or publish unfavorable research or reports about our business, this may have a negative impact on the market price of our common stock.\nThe trading market for our common stock may depend, in part, on the research and reports that securities analysts publish about our business and the Company. It is often more difficult to obtain analyst coverage for companies whose securities are traded on the OTC Market. We do not have any control over securities analysts. There is no guarantee that securities analysts will cover our common stock. If securities analysts do not cover our common stock, the lack of research coverage may adversely affect its market price. If we are covered by securities analysts, and our stock is the subject of an unfavorable report, our stock price and trading volume would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases to cover the Company or fails to publish regular reports on the Company, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Our common stock is currently covered by one securities analyst, however, we cannot assure you that this securities analyst, or any other securities analysts, will cover our common stock going forward.\nBecause state securities \u201cBlue Sky\u201d laws prohibit trading absent compliance with individual state laws, State Blue Sky registration requirements could limit resale of the shares.\nTransfer of our common stock may be restricted under the securities laws and regulations promulgated by various states and foreign jurisdictions, commonly referred to as \u201cBlue Sky\u201d laws. Absent compliance with such individual \u201cBlue Sky\u201d laws, our common stock may not be traded in such jurisdictions. It is the intention of our management to seek coverage and publication of information regarding us in an accepted publication which permits a \u201cmanuals exemption.\u201d This manuals exemption permits a security to be sold by stockholders in a particular state without being registered if the company issuing the security has a listing for that security in a securities manual recognized by that state. The listing entry must contain (i) the names of issuers, officers, and directors, (ii) an issuer\u2019s balance sheet, and (iii) a profit and loss statement for either the fiscal year preceding the balance sheet or for the most recent fiscal year of operations. The principal accepted manuals are those published by Standard and Poor\u2019s, and Mergent, Inc. Many states expressly recognize these manuals. Certain states either do not recognize principal accepted manuals or do not expressly recognize the manuals exemption. These states include: Alabama, California, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, New Hampshire, New York, Tennessee and Virginia. Registration of the securities will be required in these states. As a result, it will not be possible for persons to resell shares of our common stock pursuant to this registration statement in these states without such registration. There is no assurance that the state securities divisions will approve these registrations. Accordingly, investors should consider the secondary market for our securities to be a limited one.\nYou may experience dilution of your ownership interests because of the future issuance of additional shares of our common stock.\nAny future issuance of our equity or equity-backed securities will dilute then-current stockholders\u2019 ownership percentages and could also result in a decrease in the fair market value of our equity securities, because our assets would be owned by a larger pool of outstanding equity. As described above, we will need additional financing to continue our operations and may raise additional capital through public or private offerings of our common or preferred stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for our common or preferred stock. We may also issue such securities in connection with hiring or retaining employees and consultants (including stock options and other equity compensation issued under our equity incentive plans), as payment to providers of goods and services, in connection with future acquisitions or for other business purposes. Our Board of Directors may at any time authorize the issuance of additional common or preferred stock without common stockholder approval, subject only to the total number of authorized common and preferred shares set forth in our Articles of Incorporation. The terms of equity securities issued by us in future transactions may be more favorable to new investors, and may include dividend and/or liquidation preferences, superior voting rights and the issuance of warrants or other derivative securities, which may have a further dilutive effect. Also, the future issuance of any such additional shares of our common or preferred stock or other securities may create downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock. There can be no assurance that any such future issuances will not be at a price (or exercise prices) below the price at which shares of our common stock are then traded.\nThe conversion of our issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock could have the effect of diluting the voting power of common stockholders.\nThe conversion of shares of our Series A Preferred Stock could have the effect of changing or preventing a change of control of us and could dilute your interests. Our authorized capital stock includes 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, of which 24,325,000 shares are designated as Series A Preferred Stock. Currently, our Series A Preferred Stock converts into common stock on a one-for-one basis. However, each share of our Series A Preferred Stock will convert into more than one share of our common stock in the event that we sell certain securities of the Company at a price per share that is less than the conversion price, which is currently set at $1.00 per share. The 45-day average price per share of our common stock for the time period from February 3, 2015 through March 19, 2015 and the 90-day average price per share of our common stock for the time period from December 20, 2014 through March 19, 2015 were $1.12 and $1.18, respectively. On March 19, 2015, the last reported sales price for our common stock was $1.17 per share.\nThe effects of the conversion of shares of our Series A Preferred Stock upon the rights of our common stockholders might include, among other things, restricting dividends on our common stock, diluting the voting power of our common stockholders, reducing the market price of our common stock, or impairing the liquidation rights of our common stock.\nWe may obtain additional capital through the issuance of preferred stock, which may limit your rights as a holder of our common stock.\nWithout any stockholder vote or action, our Board of Directors may designate and approve for issuance shares of our preferred stock. The terms of any preferred stock may include priority claims to assets and dividends and special voting rights which could limit the rights of the holders of our common stock. The designation and issuance of preferred stock favorable to current management or stockholders could make any possible takeover of us or the removal of our management more difficult.\nBeing a public company is expensive and administratively burdensome.\nPublic reporting companies are subject to the information and reporting requirements of the Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and other federal securities laws, rules and regulations related thereto, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Prior to August 29, 2014, we voluntarily filed certain reports with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act. On August 29, 2014, we filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC, which subjects us to the rules and regulations of the Exchange Act, including those requiring Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. Complying with these laws and regulations requires the time and attention of our Board of Directors and management, and increases our expenses. Among other things, public reporting companies must:\n\u00b7 maintain and evaluate a system of internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the related rules and regulations of the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board;\n\u00b7 maintain policies relating to disclosure controls and procedures;\n\u00b7 prepare and distribute periodic reports in compliance with our obligations under federal securities laws;\n\u00b7 institute a more comprehensive compliance function, including with respect to corporate governance; and\n\u00b7 involve, to a greater degree, our outside legal counsel and accountants in the above activities.\nThe costs of preparing and filing annual and quarterly reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC and furnishing audited reports to stockholders is expensive and much greater than that of a privately-held company, and compliance with these rules and regulations may require us to hire additional financial reporting, internal controls and other finance personnel, and will involve a material increase in regulatory, legal and accounting expenses and the attention of management. There can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the applicable regulations in a timely manner, if at all. In addition, being a public company has made it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance. In the future, we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain this coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified executives and members of our Board of Directors, particularly directors willing to serve on the audit and compensation committees.\nAny failure to maintain effective internal control over our financial reporting could materially adversely affect us.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404, requires us to include in our annual reports on Form 10-K an assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, at such time, if any, as we are no longer a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d our independent auditors will have to attest to and report on management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of such internal control over financial reporting. We have limited experience operating as a public reporting company under the level of internal control over financial reporting required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We performed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective due to the material weakness resulting from a limited segregation of duties among our employees with respect to our control activities. This deficiency is the result of our limited number of employees. This deficiency may affect management\u2019s ability to determine if errors or inappropriate actions have taken place. Management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible changes in our disclosure controls and procedures.\nEven in the event that our management concludes that our internal control over financial reporting becomes effective, if our independent auditors are not satisfied with the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, or if the independent auditors interpret the requirements, rules or regulations differently than we do, then (to the extent we are no longer a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d) they may decline to attest to management\u2019s assessment or may issue a report that is qualified. Any of these events could result in a loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which in turn could negatively impact the price of our common stock.\nWe must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management and (if required in the future) our independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404. Our compliance with Section 404 may require that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. We currently do not have an internal audit group, and we will need to retain the services of additional accounting and financial staff or consultants with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge to satisfy the ongoing requirements of Section 404.\nNeurosciences Research Ventures, Inc. will be able to exercise substantial control over our business.\nNeurosciences Research Ventures, Inc. owns 8,573,750 shares of our common stock and 1,662,500 options to purchase shares of our common stock. In the aggregate, such securities represented beneficial ownership of approximately 36.0% of our common stock as of March 19, 2015, as calculated in accordance with Regulation S-K, Item 403. These numbers do not include 451,250 Indemnification Escrow Shares (as such term is defined in the Indemnification Shares Escrow Agreement entered into as of August 23, 2013 by and among Neurotrope, Inc., James New and Gottbetter & Partners LLP, which is being assigned to a new escrow agent and representative), that Neurosciences Research Ventures may be entitled to receive under the Indemnification Escrow Agreement. Additionally, pursuant to the Common Stockholders Agreement (as defined above), Neurosciences Research Ventures, Inc. has the right to nominate and elect two representatives to our Board of Directors. Pursuant to this right, William S. Singer and James Gottlieb are members of our Board of Directors. As a result of the foregoing, BRNI and its affiliate, Neurosciences Research Ventures, Inc., are able to exercise substantial influence over our business, policies and practices.\nIn addition, Dr. Daniel Alkon, our Chief Scientific Officer, founding Scientific Director of BRNI and the Toyota Chair in Neuroscience at BRNI,\nowns 902,500 shares of our common stock and 175,000 options to purchase shares of our common stock. In the aggregate, such securities represented beneficial ownership of approximately 4.0% of our common stock as of March 19, 2015, as calculated in accordance with Regulation S-K, Item 403. These numbers do not include 47,500 Indemnification Escrow Shares that Dr. Alkon may be entitled to receive under the Indemnification Escrow Agreement\nNorthlea Partners, LLLP is able to exercise substantial control over our business.\nNorthlea Partners, LLLP owns 4,927,650 shares of our common stock, and 955,500 options to purchase shares of our common stock and 750,000 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock. These numbers do not include 259,350 Indemnification Escrow Shares to which Northlea Partners, LLP may be entitled to receive under the Indemnification Escrow Agreement. In addition, Dr. John Abeles, who is the Managing Member of Northlea Partners, LLLP and a member of our Board of Directors owns 250,000 options to purchase shares of our common stock, of which 86,712 will be vested as of the date 60 days from March 19, 2015. In the aggregate, such securities represented beneficial ownership of approximately 23.5% of our common stock as of March 19, 2015, as calculated in accordance with Regulation S-K, Item 403. Additionally, pursuant to the Common Stockholders Agreement, Northlea Partners, LLLP has the right to nominate and elect two representatives to our Board of Directors. Pursuant to this right, Dr. John Abeles is a member of our Board of Directors. Northlea Partners, LLLP has the right to nominate and elect another representative to our Board of Directors as they see fit. To this end, Northlea Partners, LLLP nominated, and the Company\u2019s Board of Directors appointed, Dr. Larry D. Altstiel to the Company\u2019s Board of Directors. As a result of the foregoing, Northlea Partners, LLLP is able to exercise substantial influence over our business, policies and practices.", "PERMNO": 16639, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "NTRP"}
