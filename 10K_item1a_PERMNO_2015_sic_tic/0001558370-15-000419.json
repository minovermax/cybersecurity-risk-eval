{"cik": "1610793", "company": "State National Companies, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A:Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this report, including our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. The following discussion of risk factors includes forward-looking statements and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in such forward-looking statements. See \u201cNote on Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in Item 1 of this report.\nRisks Relating to Our Program Services Segment\nWe may not be able to recover amounts due from our reinsurers, which would adversely affect our financial condition.\nIn our Program Services segment, we write insurance on behalf of our capacity providers and reinsure on a quota share basis 100% of the risk under these policies with these carriers in exchange for ceding fees. Because we cede all of these risks to capacity providers, we generally hold no net reserves for losses or LAE that might arise as a result of claims made under these policies. However, as the issuer of the policies, we remain directly liable to these policyholders. In 2014, we wrote insurance policies with $909.5 million in gross written premiums through our issuing carrier, or fronting, business.\nWe reinsure substantially all of the underwriting and operating risks in connection with our fronting arrangements to our capacity providers. We take the risk of insolvency or other failure to pay by a capacity provider. We generally select either well capitalized, highly rated authorized capacity providers or we require the capacity providers to post substantial collateral to secure the reinsured risks. However, if any of our capacity providers becomes insolvent, or otherwise refuses to reimburse losses paid to these policyholders (or us, to the extent we reimburse or pay policyholders or pay other claims directly) in a timely manner, the corresponding impact to our liability for these claims could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We often hold collateral to protect us against a capacity\nprovider\u2019s failure to pay claims. However, collateral may not be sufficient to cover our liability for these claims, and we may not be able to cause the capacity provider to deliver additional collateral.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we held $2 billion in collateral securing $1.2 billion in reinsurance recoverables. In addition, we have $447.5 million of unsecured reinsurance recoverables. Our reinsurance recoverables are based on estimates, and our actual liabilities may exceed the amount that we are able to recover from our capacity providers or any collateral securing the liabilities. This could occur because the loss experience based on the policy terms is higher than expected or due to litigation, regulatory or other extra-contractual liabilities.\nIf we fail to realize a reinsurance recoverable owed under these arrangements due to insolvency, dispute or other unwillingness or inability of any of our reinsurers to meet their obligations to us, or due to our inability to access sufficient collateral to cover our liabilities, our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially and adversely affected. For additional information, see \u201cBusiness-Reinsurance\u201d in Item 1 of this report.\nIf market conditions cause our reinsurance to be more costly or difficult to obtain, we may be required to bear increased risks or reduce the level of our underwriting commitments.\nIn our Program Services segment, we provide access to the U.S. property and casualty markets in exchange for a ceding fee through our fronting business by providing access to our \u201cA\u201d (Excellent) A.M. Best rating, expansive licensing and reputation. As part of our business strategy for our Program Services segment, we reinsure substantially all underwriting risk, credit risk and business risk related to our fronting business. We may be unable to maintain our current reinsurance arrangements or to obtain other reinsurance in adequate amounts and at favorable rates, particularly if reinsurers become unwilling or unable to support our specialized fronting model in the future. In recent years, our Program Services segment has benefitted from favorable market conditions, including growth in the role of GAs and of offshore and other alternative sources of reinsurance. A decline in the availability of reinsurance, increases in the cost of reinsurance or a decreased level of activity by GAs could limit the amount of fronting business we could write and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nRegulators may challenge our use of fronting arrangements in states in which our capacity providers are not licensed.\nWe enter into fronting arrangements with GAs and domestic and foreign insurers that want to access specific U.S. property and casualty insurance business in states in which such capacity provider is not licensed or is not authorized to write particular lines of insurance. The capacity provider or the GA administers the business, settles all claims and reinsures 100% of the risks. We receive a ceding fee, but generally do not share in the profits or losses of the business we write for the capacity provider. Some state insurance regulators may object to our fronting arrangements. In certain states, including Florida and Kentucky, the Insurance Commissioner has the authority to prohibit an authorized insurer from acting as an issuing carrier for an unauthorized insurer. In addition, insurance departments in states in which there is no statutory or regulatory prohibition against an authorized insurer acting as an issuing carrier for an unauthorized insurer, such as New York, could deem the assuming insurer to be transacting insurance business without a license and the issuing carrier to be aiding and abetting the unauthorized sale of insurance.\nIf regulators in any of the states where we conduct our fronting business were to prohibit or limit the arrangement, we would be prevented or limited from conducting that business for which a capacity provider is not authorized in those states, unless and until the capacity provider is able to obtain the necessary licenses. This could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition results of operations and prospects. In particular, we do significant business in Florida. See \u201cWe write at least half of our Program Services business in several key states and adverse developments in these key states could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\u201d\nNotwithstanding these state law restrictions on ceding insurers, the Nonadmitted and Reinsurance Reform Act (\u201cNRRA\u201d) contained in The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (\u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) provides that all laws of a ceding insurer\u2019s nondomestic state (except those with respect to taxes and assessments on insurers or insurance income) are preempted to the extent that they otherwise apply the laws of the state to reinsurance\nagreements of nondomestic ceding insurers. The NRRA places the power to regulate reinsurer financial solvency primarily with the reinsurer\u2019s domiciliary state and requires credit for reinsurance to be recognized for a nondomestic ceding company if it is allowed by the ceding company\u2019s domiciliary state. A state insurance regulator might not view the NRRA as preempting a state regulator\u2019s determination that an unauthorized reinsurer must obtain a license or that a statute prohibited our doing a fronting business. However, such a determination or a conflict between state law and the NRRA could cause regulatory uncertainty about our fronting business, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nChanges in state insurance regulation could materially and adversely affect our business.\nSome states have adopted changes to their insurance laws and regulations that permit insurers to obtain credit for reinsurance from reinsurers who are able to post reduced collateral if they satisfy certain requirements, including specific rating criteria. We require many of our capacity providers to post collateral to secure their reinsurance obligations. If regulatory changes are adopted in the states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled that permit non-admitted reinsurers to post reduced or no collateral in order for the insurer to obtain credit for that reinsurance, it may become more difficult for us to obtain collateral from our capacity providers who meet the applicable rating agency requirements or the capacity providers may no longer need to utilize our fronting arrangements, which could materially and adversely affect the amount of business that we can write.\nWe depend on a limited number of capacity providers and GAs for a large portion of our gross written premium in our Program Services segment, and the loss of business provided by any one of them could materially and adversely affect us.\nOur Program Services segment offers fronting arrangements to both general agents (GAs), who sell, control, and administer books of insurance business that are supported by third-party reinsurers seeking access to U.S. property and casualty insurance business, and domestic and foreign insurers, which we collectively refer to as \u201ccapacity providers,\u201d that want to access specific U.S. property and casualty insurance business. Capacity providers may be under common control with a particular GA or they be independent. An independent capacity provider may reinsure a single book or multiple books with various GAs. A single GA may control a single book with one capacity provider or multiple books with various capacity providers.\nOther insurance companies may compete with us for this business. These capacity providers and GAs may choose to enter into fronting arrangements with our competitors or GAs, or capacity providers may terminate fronting arrangements with us if they no longer need access to our fronting capacity or for other reasons.\nOur top five GAs measured by premium volume for the year ended December 31, 2014 accounted for approximately 29%, 26%, 10%, 4% and 4% of our gross written premium in our Program Services segment, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 approximately 55%, 46% and 24% of our gross written premium in our Program Services segment was derived from our top two fronting arrangements. Our top producer, controlled by a single capacity provider, for the year ended December 31, 2014 was Meadowbrook at 29% of Program Services gross written premium and 9.3% of total consolidated revenues.\nOur top five capacity providers measured by premium volume for the year ended December 31, 2014 accounted for approximately 30%, 27%, 9%, 5%, and 3% of our gross written premium in our Program Services segment. For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 approximately 57%, 48% and 25% of our gross written premium in our Program Services segment was derived from our top two capacity providers. Much of the business concentrated with these capacity providers is also included in the business concentrated with the GAs noted above.\nA significant decrease in business from, or the entire loss of, our largest capacity provider or GA or several of our other large capacity providers or GAs would cause us to lose premium and require us to seek additional capacity providers or GAs or to replace the lost premium. In the event that we are unable to do so, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects would be materially and adversely affected.\nFailure of capacity providers or GAs to properly market, underwrite or administer policies could adversely affect us.\nThe marketing, underwriting, claims administration and other administration of policies in our Program Services segment are the responsibility of our capacity providers or our GAs. Any failure by them to properly handle these functions could result in liability to us. Even though they may be required to compensate us for any such liability, there are risks that any such failures could create regulatory or reputational issues for us and that they do not pay us because they become insolvent or otherwise, either of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe write at least half of our Program Services business in several key states and adverse developments in these key states could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 we derived approximately 56%, 56% and 54% of our gross written premium in our Program Services segment in the states of Texas, New York, California and Florida. As a result, our financial results are subject to prevailing regulatory, legal, economic, demographic, competitive, and other conditions in these states. Adverse developments relating to any of these conditions could have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. See \u201cBusiness-Program Services Segment-Geographic Distribution.\u201d\nWe may not be successful in building more direct relationships with GAs and capacity providers through a direct marketing campaign.\nHistorically, our fronting capacity has been constrained by the size of our capital base, and we have relied on our relationship-driven channels to generate new fronting business with only a modest sales and marketing effort. In addition, we have historically relied on brokers to identify GAs in need of fronting. We believe that the additional capital from the private placement will enable us to expand our Program Services segment. We are further institutionalizing our sales process by building more direct relationships with GAs and capacity providers and have hired fully-dedicated sales staff. We may not be successful in our efforts to further expand our fronting business.\nWe may face increased competition in our Program Services segment.\nWe believe there are relatively few active competitors in our Program Services segment. Unlike us, some of our competitors may offer policy administration or other services or be willing to take on significant underwriting risk. Any increase in competition in this segment, especially by one or more substantial companies, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nSome of our fronting arrangements contain limits on the reinsurer\u2019s obligations to us.\nWhile we reinsure substantially all of the risks inherent in our fronting programs, we have in certain cases entered into programs that contain limits on our reinsurers\u2019 obligations to us, including loss ratio caps or aggregate reinsurance limits. For example, under our recent program with Nephila Capital Ltd., we bear no business or insurance risk except for annual aggregate agreement year losses in excess of a limit that we believe is highly unlikely to be exceeded. To the extent losses under these programs exceed the prescribed limits, we will be liable to pay the losses in excess of such limits, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur losses resulting from the run-off of the retained business may exceed our reserves.\nIn the past, we have participated on a quota share basis to a limited extent in certain programs in the Program Services segment. In early 2012, we reinsured to inception the retained business under most of the active contracts, but others continue to run-off. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Factors Affecting Our Operating Results-Run-off of the Retained Business\u201d in Item 7 of this report. As of December 31, 2014, we had reserves of $3.1 million related to this business. In the event our losses resulting from this\nbusiness exceeds our reserves, the excess losses could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nRisks Relating to Our Lender Services Segment\nLender-placed residential hazard insurance is under increased regulatory scrutiny and has been subject to recent regulatory changes at both the federal and state levels. If lender-placed automobile insurance becomes subject to similar regulatory scrutiny and is affected by regulatory changes, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nThrough our Lender Services segment, we provide collateral protection insurance, or CPI, to financial institutions. Other companies provide similar products to home lenders. Under certain circumstances, when borrowers fail to provide hazard insurance on their residences, the owner or servicer of the loan may place such insurance to protect the collateral and passes on the premium to the borrower. This lender-placed residential hazard insurance has come under increased regulatory scrutiny and has been subject to recent regulatory changes. For example, on December 18, 2013, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac announced that effective June 1, 2014, mortgage servicers and their affiliates may not receive commissions or other forms of compensation with lender-placed insurance on GSE loans or ceding premiums to a reinsurer affiliated with the servicers.\nState regulators have also taken action to restrict insurance practices relating to lender-placed residential hazard insurance. For example, in New York, on September 19, 2013, the State of New York\u2019s Department of Financial Services, or NY DFS, released proposed regulations that, among other things, would prohibit insurers from: issuing force-placed insurance on mortgaged property serviced by a servicer affiliated with the insurer; paying commissions to a bank or servicer or other parties affiliated with a bank or servicer on force-placed insurance policies obtained by the servicer; paying contingent commissions based on underwriting profitability or loss ratios; making payments, including but not limited to the payment of expenses, to a servicer or other parties affiliated with a servicer in connection with securing force-placed insurance business; and providing free or below-cost, outsourced services to banks, servicers or their affiliates. The NY DFS and Florida Office of Insurance Regulation have also entered into settlements with certain large providers of lender-placed residential hazard insurance. The NY DFS settlements, for example, included restitution for homeowners, multi-million dollar penalties, and major reforms for the companies\u2019 lender-placed insurance programs. The NY DFS is also encouraging other lender-placed residential hazard insurers and mortgage servicers operating in New York to adopt similar reforms. The NY DFS has urged other states to implement these reforms, as evidenced by a letter to all state Insurance Commissioners in 2013. There have also been multi-million dollar class action settlements that included not only payments by lender-placed residential hazard insurance carriers but contained restrictions on such lender-placed insurers as well. If lender-placed automobile insurance becomes subject to similar regulatory scrutiny and is affected by regulatory changes, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn the future, states may subject lender-placed automobile insurance to additional regulatory scrutiny or propose regulatory changes to related laws. In particular, CPI\u2019s higher expense ratios and lower loss ratios, as compared to other insurance products, presents a risk that regulatory requirements such as minimum loss ratios could be proposed in the future. Any future proposed or adopted rules relating to automobile CPI could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operation and prospects.\nThe CPI market is highly competitive, and we may not be able to compete effectively against larger companies.\nThe CPI market is highly competitive. We compete on the bases of price, coverages offered, claims handling, customer service, geographic coverage, financial strength ratings, licenses, reputation, technology, relationships with business partners and experience. Some of our competitors have substantially more capital, comparable or higher ratings and greater resources than we have, and offer a broader range of products than we offer. Many of our competitors invest heavily in advertising and marketing efforts and/or expanding their online service offerings. Some of these competitors may have better brand recognition than we have and have a larger market share than we do. As a result, these larger competitors may be better able to offer lower rates to customers, to withstand larger losses, and to more effectively take\nadvantage of new marketing opportunities. Our ability to compete against these larger competitors depends on our ability to deliver superior service and maintain our relationships with our clients.\nWe may undertake strategic marketing and operating initiatives to improve our competitive position and drive growth. If we are unable to successfully implement new strategic initiatives or if our marketing campaigns do not attract new customers, our competitive position may be harmed, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe termination of our alliance with CUNA Mutual could materially and adversely affect our growth prospects for our CPI business and our liquidity.\nOur alliance with CUNA Mutual has allowed us to significantly increase the amount of CPI business we write due to the business that is generated by CUNA Mutual\u2019s sales and marketing efforts. For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, the CPI gross premiums written through our alliance with CUNA Mutual represented 56.3%, 53.8% and 51.5% of our total CPI business, respectively. During 2014, we amended the alliance agreement to increase our retention of the business subject to the alliance to 70% from 50% for business written on or after July 1, 2014, and in exchange have made payments to CUNA Mutual totaling $17.8 million, which payments may be adjusted somewhat based on net premiums and loss ratio for the 12-month period ending June 30, 2015. In addition, the term of the alliance has been extended at least through July 31, 2018.\nIf the alliance were to terminate and we no longer had access to those extensive sales and marketing efforts, our ability to continue to grow our CPI business would be materially and adversely affected. CUNA Mutual has the right to terminate its alliance agreement with us upon a change in control of State National or certain of its subsidiaries, which is defined to include any substantial change in the senior management team involving the departure, within any 12-month period, of two or more of the following three executives: John Pearson, Trace Ledbetter and David Hale. See \u201cBusiness-Lender Services Segment-Business Overview-Relationship with CUNA Mutual\u201d in Item 1 of this report. In addition, if and when the alliance agreement terminates, depending upon the reason for the termination and subject to certain exceptions, we may be required to buy out CUNA Mutual\u2019s right to participate in future program business at a price equal to the previous 12 months net premium times a percentage based on the loss ratio of the business during that period. Giving effect to the 2014 amendment of the alliance agreement, we estimate that the amount of this payment as of December 31, 2014 would be approximately $20 million. If we were required to make this payment, it could have a material and adverse effect on our liquidity.\nWe may not be successful in expanding our CPI business within the banking and specialty finance company markets.\nBecause of our exclusive relationship with CUNA Mutual, we have focused our CPI business on credit unions. As a result, our penetration in the CPI market for banks and specialty finance companies has been relatively low. We believe that the CPI market for banks is substantially larger than the credit union market and that the specialty finance company market is potentially more attractive to CPI providers due to higher incidences of borrowers\u2019 failing to obtain or maintain the required insurance. We have begun devoting additional sales and marketing efforts towards the bank and specialty finance markets and have hired additional dedicated sales staff to address those markets. Our efforts to further increase the overall amount of CPI business we write in the bank and specialty finance markets may not be successful, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nChanges affecting the automobile loan business generally and the CPI business in particular could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nA number of economic and market conditions affect vehicle sales volume and product mix, the amount of automobile loans and the CPI market, including levels of unemployment, consumer confidence, average age of vehicles on the road, availability and cost of credit, cost of fuel, credit profiles of borrowers and amounts sought to be financed. Our CPI business has benefitted in recent periods from a strong overall automobile loan environment, including increases in vehicle sales and average amounts financed. Any negative changes in market conditions could materially\nand adversely affect demand for our CPI product offerings and, consequently, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe write more of our Lender Services business in Texas than any other state, and adverse developments in Texas could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we derived approximately 13% of our gross written premium in our Lender Services segment from the State of Texas. As a result, our financial results are subject to prevailing regulatory, legal, economic, demographic, competitive, and other conditions in Texas. Adverse developments relating to any of these conditions could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIf we are unable to establish and maintain accurate allowance for policy cancellations, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur financial statements include an allowance for policy cancellations, which represent our best estimate of the amounts that our insurance subsidiaries will ultimately refund for CPI polices that cancel (net of applicable offsetting expenses) as of the date of the financial statements. There is inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing the allowance.\nAs a result of these uncertainties, the ultimate refunds paid may deviate, perhaps substantially, from the point-in-time estimates of such refunds and expenses, as reflected in the allowance for policy cancellations included in our financial statements. To the extent that premium refunds exceed our estimates, we will be required to immediately recognize the unfavorable development and increase our allowance for policy cancellations, with a corresponding reduction in our net income in the period in which the allowance is increased. Consequently, ultimate refunds paid could materially exceed the reported allowance for policy cancellations and have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nRisks Relating to Our Business Generally\nA downgrade in the A.M. Best rating of our insurance subsidiaries would reduce the amount of business we are able to write and could materially adversely impact the competitive positions of our insurance subsidiaries.\nRating agencies evaluate insurance companies based on their ability to pay claims. Our insurance subsidiaries have been assigned an \u201cA\u201d (Excellent) rating by A.M. Best Company, Inc. The ratings of A.M. Best are subject to periodic review using, among other things, proprietary capital adequacy models, and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time. Our competitive position relative to other companies is determined in part by the A.M. Best rating of our insurance subsidiaries. A.M. Best ratings are directed toward the concerns of policyholders and insurance agencies and are not intended for the protection of investors or as a recommendation to buy, hold or sell securities.\nWe rely on our \u201cA\u201d rating from A.M. Best to operate our fronting business and our Lender Services business. There can be no assurances that our insurance subsidiaries will be able to maintain this rating. Any downgrade in ratings would likely adversely affect our business through the loss of certain existing and potential policyholders and the loss of relationships with clients that might move to other companies with higher ratings. If we lost our \u201cA\u201d rating, our capacity providers would likely seek a higher rated issuing carrier to write their business.\nOur Lender Services segment would also be adversely affected if a large number of our accounts were to require an insurer with an \u201cA\u201d rating. In addition, pursuant to the arrangement with CUNA Mutual, if our A.M. Best rating falls below \u201cA-\u201d for more than 180 consecutive days, CUNA Mutual will be entitled to terminate the arrangement with us and thereafter CUNA Mutual will have the option to purchase our right to participate in the future business of the alliance. We are not able to quantify the percentage of our business, in terms of premiums or otherwise, that would be affected by a downgrade in our A.M. Best ratings.\nIf we are unable to accurately underwrite risks and charge competitive yet profitable rates to our clients and policyholders, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\nIn general, the premiums for our insurance policies are established at the time a policy is issued and, therefore, before all of our underlying costs are known. Like other insurance companies, we rely on estimates and assumptions in setting our premium rates. Establishing adequate premiums is necessary, together with investment income, to generate sufficient revenue to offset losses, loss adjustment expenses (\u201cLAE\u201d) and other underwriting costs and to earn a profit. If we do not accurately assess the risks that we assume, we may not charge adequate premiums to cover our losses and expenses, which would negatively affect our results of operations and our financial condition. Alternatively, we could set our premiums too high, which could reduce our competitiveness and lead to lower revenues. In addition, a variety of economic factors can affect losses in our CPI business. For example, difficult economic conditions could lead to increased losses as a result of increased premium deficiency and conversion/skip claims.\nPricing involves the acquisition and analysis of historical loss data, and the projection of future trends, loss costs and expenses, and inflation trends, among other factors, for each of our products in multiple risk tiers and many different markets. In order to accurately price our policies, we:\n\u00b7\ncollect and properly analyze a substantial volume of data from our insureds;\n\u00b7\ndevelop, test and apply appropriate projections and rating formulas;\n\u00b7\nclosely monitor and timely recognize changes in trends; and\n\u00b7\nproject expected losses for our insureds with reasonable accuracy.\nWe seek to implement our pricing accurately in accordance with our assumptions. Our ability to undertake these efforts successfully and, as a result, accurately price our policies, is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u00b7\ninsufficient or unreliable data;\n\u00b7\nincorrect or incomplete analysis of available data;\n\u00b7\nuncertainties generally inherent in estimates and assumptions;\n\u00b7\nour failure to implement appropriate actuarial projections and rating formulas or other pricing methodologies;\n\u00b7\nregulatory constraints on rate increases;\n\u00b7\nour failure to accurately estimate investment yields and the duration of our liability for loss and LAE; and\n\u00b7\nunanticipated court decisions, legislation or regulatory action.\nOur failure to accurately and timely pay claims could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe must accurately and timely evaluate and pay claims that are made under our CPI and other policies. Many factors affect our ability to pay claims accurately and timely, including the training and experience of our claims representatives, our claims organization\u2019s culture and the effectiveness of our management, our ability to develop or select and implement appropriate procedures and systems to support our claims functions and other factors. Our failure to pay claims accurately and timely could lead to regulatory and administrative actions, material litigation, undermine\nour reputation in the marketplace and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIn addition, if we do not train new claims employees effectively or lose a significant number of experienced claims employees, our claims department\u2019s ability to handle an increasing workload could be adversely affected. In addition to potentially requiring that growth be slowed in the affected markets, our business could suffer from decreased quality of claims work which, in turn, could lower our operating margins.\nOur insurance subsidiaries are subject to minimum capital and surplus requirements. Our failure to meet these requirements could subject us to regulatory action.\nThe laws of the states of domicile of our insurance subsidiaries impose risk-based capital standards and other minimum capital and surplus requirements. Failure to meet applicable risk-based capital requirements or minimum statutory capital requirements could subject us to further examination or corrective action imposed by state regulators, including limitations on our writing of additional business, state supervision or liquidation. Any changes in existing risk-based capital requirements or minimum statutory capital requirements may require us to increase our statutory capital levels, which we may be unable to do.\nIf we are unable to establish and maintain accurate loss reserves, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur financial statements include loss reserves, which represent our best estimate of the amounts that our insurance subsidiaries ultimately will pay on claims that have been incurred, and the related costs of adjusting those claims, as of the date of the financial statements. There is inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing insurance loss reserves.\nAs a result of these uncertainties, the ultimate paid loss and LAE may deviate, perhaps substantially, from the point-in-time estimates of such losses and expenses, as reflected in the loss reserves included in our financial statements. To the extent that loss and LAE exceed our estimates, we will be required to immediately recognize the unfavorable development and increase loss reserves, with a corresponding reduction in our net income in the period in which the reserve levels are increased. Consequently, ultimate losses paid could materially exceed reported loss reserves and have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nCatastrophic losses or the frequency of smaller insured losses may exceed our expectations, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur insurance business is subject to claims arising from catastrophes, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, floods, earthquakes, hailstorms, severe winter weather, and fires, or other events, such as explosions, terrorist attacks, riots, and hazardous material releases. The incidence and severity of such events are inherently unpredictable, and our losses from catastrophes could be substantial. In our Program Services business, although we reinsure substantially all of the underwriting risk through our fronting arrangements, a catastrophe loss could impair the ability of one or more of our reinsurers to pay all of the reinsured claims, in which case we would be responsible for paying any claims not paid by our reinsurer(s). In our Lender Services business, it is possible that we may experience an unusual frequency of smaller losses in a particular period. In either case, the consequences could be substantial volatility in our financial condition or results of operations for any fiscal quarter or year, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects or our ability to write new business.\nOngoing economic uncertainty could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nGlobal economies and financial markets have experienced significant weakness and volatility since 2008, although the most extreme of these circumstances have abated since that time. Despite improved financial market performance since 2009, near-term U.S. economic prospects have only very gradually improved. In addition, U.S. federal and state governments continue to experience significant structural fiscal deficits, creating uncertainty as to levels of taxation, inflation, regulation and other economic fundamentals that may impact future growth prospects. Significantly greater\neconomic, fiscal and monetary uncertainty remains in Europe, due to the combination of poor economic growth, high unemployment and significant sovereign deficits. Continuation of these conditions may potentially affect (among other aspects of our business) the demand for and claims made under our products, the ability of clients, counterparties and others to establish or maintain their relationships with us, our ability to access and efficiently use internal and external capital resources and our investment performance. In the event that these conditions persist and result in a prolonged period of economic uncertainty, our business, financial condition, results of operations, our prospects and competitor landscape could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business is dependent on the efforts of our executive officers and other personnel. If we are unsuccessful in our efforts to attract, train and retain qualified personnel, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur success is dependent on the efforts of our executive officers because of their industry expertise, knowledge of our markets, and relationships with our clients. Our executive officers are Terry Ledbetter, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, David Hale, Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, John Pearson, Executive Vice President and National Sales Manager, Trace Ledbetter, Executive Vice President of Service, and David Cleff, Executive Vice President of Business Affairs, General Counsel and Secretary. In connection with the private placement, we amended or entered into agreements with our executive officers that contain certain non-compete and non-solicit provisions. Nonetheless, should any of our executive officers cease working for us, we may be unable to find acceptable replacements with comparable skills and experience in the niche markets that we target. In addition, our business is also dependent on other skilled employees. We cannot assure you that we will be able to attract, train and retain, on a timely basis and on anticipated economic and other terms, experienced and capable senior management, underwriters and support staff. We intend to pay competitive salaries, bonuses and equity-based rewards in order to attract and retain such personnel, but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in such endeavors. The loss of key personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. We do not currently maintain life insurance policies with respect to our executive officers or other employees.\nIf we are unable to maintain our technology platform or our technology platform fails to operate properly, or meet the technological demands of our clients with respect to the products and services we offer, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to properly maintain our InsurTrak system and the remainder of our technology systems or if our technology systems otherwise fail to perform in the manner we currently contemplate, our ability to effectively underwrite and issue policies, process claims and perform other business functions, and our CPI clients\u2019 ability to track and manage their CPI programs, could be significantly impaired and our business, reputation and financial performance could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, the success of our business is dependent on our ability to resolve any issues identified with our technology arrangements during operations and make any necessary improvements in a timely manner. Further, we will need to match or exceed the technological capabilities of our competitors over time. We cannot predict with certainty the cost of such maintenance and improvements, but failure to make such improvements could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. See \u201cBusiness-Technology.\u201d\nAlso, we use e-commerce and other technology to provide, expand and market our products and services. Accordingly, we believe that it will be essential to continue to invest resources in maintaining electronic connectivity with clients and, more generally, in e-commerce and technology. Our business may suffer if we do not maintain these arrangements or keep pace with the technological demands of our clients.\nIf we experience security breaches or other disruptions involving our technology, our ability to conduct our business could be adversely affected, we could be liable to third parties and our reputation could suffer, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur business is dependent upon the uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunication systems. We rely upon our systems, as well as the systems of our vendors, for all our business operations, including\nunderwriting and issuing policies, processing claims, providing customer service, complying with insurance regulatory requirements and performing actuarial and other analytical functions necessary for underwriting, pricing and product development. Our operations are dependent upon our ability to timely and efficiently maintain and improve our information and telecommunications systems and protect them from physical loss, telecommunications failure or other similar catastrophic events, as well as from security breaches. A shut-down of, or inability to access, one or more of our facilities; a power outage; or a failure of one or more of our information technology, telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis. In the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe, terrorist attack or industrial accident, or due to a computer virus, our systems could be inaccessible for an extended period of time. While we have implemented business contingency plans and other reasonable and appropriate internal controls to protect our systems from interruption, loss or security breaches, a sustained business interruption or system failure could adversely impact our ability to process our business, provide customer service, pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions.\nOur operations depend on the reliable and secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. Computer viruses, hackers, employee misconduct and other external hazards could expose our data systems to security breaches, cyber-attacks or other disruptions. In addition, we routinely transmit and receive personal, confidential and proprietary information by electronic means. We have implemented security measures designed to protect against breaches of security and other interference with our systems and networks resulting from attacks by third parties, including hackers, and from employee or advisor error or malfeasance. Despite these measures, we cannot assure that our systems and networks will not be subject to breaches or interference. Any such event may result in operational disruptions as well as unauthorized access to or the disclosure or loss of our proprietary information or our clients\u2019 or insureds\u2019 information, which in turn may result in legal claims, regulatory scrutiny and liability, reputational damage, the incurrence of costs to eliminate or mitigate further exposure, the loss of clients or affiliated advisors or other damage to our business. In addition, the trend toward broad consumer and general public notification of such incidents could exacerbate the harm to our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if we successfully protect our technology infrastructure and the confidentiality of sensitive data, we could suffer harm to our business and reputation if attempted security breaches are publicized. We cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities, discovery of new vulnerabilities, attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in our systems, data thefts, physical system or network break-ins or inappropriate access, or other developments will not compromise or breach the technology or other security measures protecting the networks and systems used in connection with our business.\nIf we cannot sustain our business relationships, including our relationships with GAs, capacity providers and with clients in our Lender Service segment, we may be unable to compete effectively and operate profitably.\nOur relationships with our clients are generally governed by agreements that may be terminated on short notice. As a result, our ability to compete and remain profitable depends, in part, on our maintaining business relationships with our clients, the marketing efforts of our sales professionals, the servicing efforts of our relationship managers and on our ability to offer insurance products and maintain financial strength ratings that meet the requirements and preferences of our clients. Any failure on our part to be effective in any of these areas may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nPerformance of our investment portfolio is subject to a variety of investment risks that may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur results are affected, in part, by the performance of our investment portfolio. Our investment portfolio contains interest rate sensitive investments, such as fixed-income securities. As of December 31, 2014, our investment in fixed-income securities was approximately $309.9 million, or 99.2% of our total investment portfolio. Increases in market interest rates may have an adverse impact on the value of our investment portfolio by decreasing the value of fixed-income securities. Conversely, declining market interest rates could have an adverse impact on our investment income as we invest positive cash flows from operations and as we reinvest proceeds from maturing and called investments in new investments that could yield lower rates than our investments have historically generated. Defaults in our investment portfolio may produce operating losses and materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nInterest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions, and other factors beyond our control. Although we take measures to manage the risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment, we may not be able to mitigate interest rate sensitivity effectively. Our mitigation efforts include maintaining a high quality portfolio and managing the duration of the portfolio to reduce the effect of interest rate changes. Despite our mitigation efforts, a significant change in interest rates could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIn addition, the performance of our investment portfolio generally is subject to other risks, including the following:\n\u00b7\nthe risk of decrease in value due to a deterioration in the financial condition, operating performance or business prospects of one or more issuers of our fixed-income securities;\n\u00b7\nthe risk that our portfolio may be too heavily concentrated in the securities of one or more issuers, sectors or industries;\n\u00b7\nthe risk that we will not be able to convert investment securities into cash on favorable terms and on a timely basis; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral movements in the values of securities markets.\nIf our investment portfolio were to suffer a substantial decrease in value due to market, sector or issuer-specific conditions, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. A decrease in value of an insurance subsidiary\u2019s investment portfolio could also put the subsidiary at risk of failing to satisfy regulatory minimum capital requirements and could limit the subsidiary\u2019s ability to write new business.\nThe insurance industry is subject to extensive regulation, which may affect our ability to execute our business plan and grow our business.\nWe are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision by government agencies in Texas and Delaware, states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, as well as all states in which they are licensed, sell insurance products, issue policies, or handle claims. Some states impose restrictions or require prior regulatory approval of specific corporate actions, which may adversely affect our ability to operate, innovate, obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely manner or grow our business profitably. These regulations provide safeguards for policyholders and are not intended to protect the interests of shareholders. Our ability to comply with these laws and regulations, and to obtain necessary regulatory action in a timely manner is, and will continue to be, critical to our success. Some of these regulations include:\n\u00b7\nRequired Licensing. We operate under licenses issued by the insurance departments in the states in which we sell insurance. If a regulatory authority denies or delays granting a new license, our ability to enter that market quickly or offer new insurance products in that market may be substantially impaired. In addition, if the insurance department in any state in which we currently operate suspends, non-renews, or revokes an existing license, we would not be able to offer affected products in that state.\n\u00b7\nTransactions between Insurance Companies and Their Affiliates. Transactions between us or any of our affiliates and our insurance companies generally must be disclosed, and prior approval is required before any material or extraordinary transaction may be consummated. Approval may be refused or the time required to obtain approval may delay some transactions, which may adversely affect our ability to innovate or operate efficiently. Our unregulated entities receive substantial payments for services rendered to our insurance company subsidiaries pursuant to arrangements approved by insurance regulators. Changes in insurance regulation could materially and adversely affect the amount of cash flow we are able to generate outside of our insurance company subsidiaries.\n\u00b7\nRegulation of Insurance Rates and Approval of Policy Forms. The insurance laws of most states in which we conduct business require insurance companies to file insurance rate schedules and insurance policy forms for review and approval. If, as permitted in some states, we begin using new rates before they are approved, we\nmay be required to issue refunds or credits to the policyholders if the new rates are ultimately deemed excessive or unfair and disapproved by the applicable insurance department. In other states, prior approval of rate changes is required and there may be long delays in the approval process or the rates may not be approved. Accordingly, our ability to respond to market developments or increased costs in that state could be adversely affected.\n\u00b7\nOther Regulations. We must also comply with regulations involving, among other matters:\n\u00b7\nthe use of non-public consumer information and related privacy issues;\n\u00b7\nthe use of credit history in underwriting and rating policies;\n\u00b7\nlimitations on the ability to charge policy fees;\n\u00b7\nlimitations on types and amounts of investments;\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on the payment of dividends;\n\u00b7\nthe acquisition or disposition of an insurance company or of any company controlling an insurance company;\n\u00b7\ninvoluntary assignments of high-risk policies, participation in reinsurance facilities and underwriting associations, assessments and other governmental charges;\n\u00b7\nreporting with respect to financial condition; and\n\u00b7\nperiodic financial and market conduct examinations performed by state insurance department examiners.\nThe failure to comply with these laws and regulations may also result in regulatory actions, fines and penalties, and in extreme cases, revocation of our ability to do business in a particular jurisdiction. In the past we have been fined by state insurance departments for failing to comply with certain laws and regulations. In addition, we may face individual and class action lawsuits by insured and other parties for alleged violations of certain of these laws or regulations.\nRegulation may become more extensive in the future, which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nCompliance with applicable laws and regulations is time-consuming and personnel-intensive, and changes in these laws and regulations may materially increase our direct and indirect compliance and other expenses of doing business, thus materially and adversely affecting our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe National Association of Insurance Commissioners (\u201cNAIC\u201d) Creditor-Placed Insurance Model Act (\u201cModel Act\u201d) applies to insurance placed in connection with automobile loans and creates a legal framework within which creditor-placed insurance may be written and helps to maintain the separation between creditors and insurers. It also serves to minimize the possibilities of unfair competitive practices in the sale of creditor-placed insurance. The Model Act has only been adopted by a few states, including Arkansas, Michigan, Mississippi and Tennessee, but other states have adopted regulations that cover creditor-placed insurance practices. There could be an effort, especially from consumer groups, to expand the protections and breadth of the Model Act or similar regulations. The NAIC Property and Casualty Insurance Committee is currently reviewing the Model Act and may make recommendations for changes later in 2015. If changes are made to the Model Act or similar regulations that adversely affect our Lender Services business, then our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn the future, states may make existing insurance laws and regulation more restrictive or enact new restrictive laws. In such event, we may seek to reduce our business in, or withdraw entirely from, these states. Additionally, from time to time, the United States Congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry\nto determine whether federal regulation is necessary. Currently, the U.S. federal government does not directly regulate the property and casualty insurance business. However, Dodd-Frank Act established a Federal Insurance Office (\u201cFIO\u201d) within the Department of the Treasury. The FIO initially is charged with monitoring all aspects of the insurance industry (other than health insurance, certain long-term care insurance and crop insurance), gathering data, and conducting a study on methods to modernize and improve the insurance regulatory system in the United States. On December 12, 2013, the FIO issued a report (as required under the Dodd-Frank Act) entitled \u201cHow to Modernize and Improve the System of Insurance Regulation in the United States\u201d (the \u201cReport\u201d), which stated that, given the \u201cuneven\u201d progress the states have made with several near-term state reforms, should the states fail to accomplish the necessary modernization reforms in the near term, \u201cCongress should strongly consider direct federal involvement.\u201d The FIO continues to support the current state-based regulatory regime, but will consider federal regulation should the states fail to take steps to greater uniformity (e.g., federal licensing of insurers). The Report also appears to signal greater activity by the federal government in dealing with non-U.S. regulators and regulatory regimes, using the authority expressly given by the Dodd-Frank Act to the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the United States Trade Representative to negotiate \u201ccovered agreements\u201d with foreign authorities. Each year the FIO also releases an annual report on the insurance industry (\u2018Annual Report\u201d), with its latest Annual Report released on September 24, 2014. The Annual Report restated many of the recommendations made in the Report along with providing an overview of the financial performance and condition of the U.S. insurance industry and outlining a number of insurance industry and regulatory developments from the past year. We cannot predict what impact, if any, this guidance or any new legislation would have on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See \u201cBusiness-Regulation-Federal and State Legislative and Regulatory Changes\u201d in Item 1 of this report.\nOur holding company structure and certain regulatory and other constraints, including adverse business performance, could affect our ability to satisfy our obligations.\nWe are a holding company and conduct our business operations through our various subsidiaries. Our principal sources of funds are payments from our subsidiaries, income from our investment portfolio and funds that may be raised from time to time in the capital markets. We will be largely dependent on amounts from our subsidiaries to pay principal and interest on any indebtedness that we may incur, to pay holding company operating expenses, to make capital investments in our other subsidiaries and to pay dividends on our common stock.\nOur insurance subsidiaries are subject to statutory requirements as to maintenance of policyholders\u2019 surplus and payment of dividends, including in their states of domicile, Texas and Delaware. In general, the maximum amount of dividends that the insurance subsidiaries may pay in any 12-month period without regulatory approval is the greater of adjusted statutory net income or 10% of statutory policyholders\u2019 surplus as of the preceding calendar year end. Adjusted statutory net income is generally defined for this purpose to be statutory net income, net of realized capital gains, for the calendar year preceding the date of the dividend. In addition, other states may limit or restrict our insurance subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay shareholder dividends generally or as a condition to issuance of a certificate of authority. See \u201cBusiness-Regulation-State Insurance Regulation\u201d in Item 1 of this report.\nWe may require additional capital in the future and such additional capital may not be available to us, or only available to us on unfavorable terms.\nOur future capital requirements depend on many factors, including our ability to write new business successfully and to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses. To the extent that the funds generated by our ongoing operations and initial capitalization are insufficient to fund future operating requirements, we may need to raise additional funds through financings or curtail our growth and reduce our assets. We cannot be sure that we will be able to raise equity or debt financing on terms favorable to us and our shareholders and in the amounts that we require, or at all. If we cannot obtain adequate capital, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, the terms of a capital raising transaction could require us to agree to stringent financial and operating covenants and to grant security interests on our assets to lenders or holders of our debt securities that could limit our flexibility in operating our business or our ability to pay dividends on our common stock and could make it more difficult for us to obtain capital in the future.\nThe rates we charge under the policies we write in our Program Services segment and our Lender Services segment are subject to prior regulatory approval in most of the states in which we operate.\nIn most of the states in which we operate, we must obtain prior regulatory approval of insurance rates charged to our insureds and our clients\u2019 insureds, including any increases in those rates. If we are unable to receive approval for the rate changes we request, or if such approval were delayed, our ability to operate our business in a profitable manner may be limited and our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity may be adversely affected.\nThe effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain and negative developments in this area could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nAs industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. These issues may materially and adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims. In some instances, these changes may not become apparent until after we have issued insurance policies that are affected by the changes. As a result, the full extent of our liability under an insurance policy may not be known until many years after the policy is issued. Changes of this nature may expose us to higher claims than we anticipated when we wrote the underlying policy. Unexpected increases in our claim costs many years after policies are issued may also result in our inability to recover from certain of our reinsurers the full amount that they would otherwise owe us for such claims costs because certain of the reinsurance agreements covering our business include commutation clauses that permit the reinsurers to terminate their obligations by making a final payment to us based on an estimate of their remaining liabilities. In addition, the potential passage of new legislation designed to expand the right to sue, to remove limitations on recovery, to deem by statute the existence of a covered occurrence, to extend the statutes of limitations or otherwise repeal or weaken tort reforms could have an adverse impact on our business. The effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely hard to predict and could be harmful to our business and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe rely on the use of credit scoring in pricing and underwriting certain of our insurance policies and any legal or regulatory requirements that restrict our ability to access credit score information could decrease the accuracy of our pricing and underwriting process and thus decrease our ability to be profitable.\nWe use credit scoring as a factor in pricing and underwriting decisions where allowed by state law. Consumer groups and regulators have questioned whether the use of credit scoring unfairly discriminates against some groups of people and are calling for laws and regulations to prohibit or restrict the use of credit scoring in underwriting and pricing. Laws or regulations that significantly curtail or regulate the use of credit scoring, if enacted in a large number of states in which we operate, could impact the integrity of our pricing and underwriting process, which could, in turn, materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, and make it harder for us to be profitable over time.\nAssessments and other surcharges for guaranty funds, second-injury funds, catastrophe funds, and other mandatory pooling arrangements for insurers may reduce our profitability.\nVirtually all states require insurers licensed to do business in their state to bear a portion of the loss suffered by some insured parties as the result of impaired or insolvent insurance companies. In addition, as a condition to the ability to conduct business in various states, our insurance subsidiaries must participate in mandatory property and casualty shared market mechanisms or pooling arrangements, which provide various types of insurance coverage to individuals or entities that otherwise are unable to purchase that coverage from private insurers. The effect of these assessments and mandatory shared-market mechanisms or changes in them could reduce our profitability in any given period or limit our ability to grow our business.\nThe effects of litigation on our business are uncertain and could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and prospects.\nAlthough we are not currently involved in any material litigation with our clients or insureds, other members of the insurance industry are the target of class action lawsuits and other types of litigation, some of which involve claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts, and the outcomes of which are unpredictable. This litigation is based on a variety of issues, including insurance and claim settlement practices. We cannot predict with any certainty whether we will be involved in such litigation in the future or what impact such litigation would have on our business.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur revenues and results of operations may fluctuate due to the factors beyond our control, which could cause the price of our common stock to be volatile.\nOur common stock has recently been listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol \u201cSNC\u201d. Our performance, as well as government regulatory action, interest rates and general market conditions, could have a significant impact on the future market price of our common stock. Some of the factors that could negatively affect our share price or result in fluctuations in the price of our common stock include:\n\u00b7\nour operating results in any future quarter not meeting the expectations of market analysts or investors;\n\u00b7\nreductions in our earnings estimates by us or market analysts;\n\u00b7\npublication of negative research or other unfavorable publicity or speculation in the press or investment community about our company or the insurance industry in general;\n\u00b7\nincreases in interest rates causing investors to demand a higher yield or return on investment than an investment in our common stock may be projected to provide;\n\u00b7\nchanges in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u00b7\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the economic or regulatory environment in the markets in which we operate;\n\u00b7\nthe occurrence of any of the other risk factors presented in this report; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral market, economic and political conditions.\nPrior to the completion of the private placement, we were treated for federal income tax purposes as a \u201cSubchapter S corporation\u201d under the Internal Revenue Code, and claims of taxing authorities related to our prior status as an \u201cS\u201d corporation could harm us.\nUpon completion of the private placement, our parent company\u2019s \u201cS\u201d corporation status terminated, and State National became treated as a \u201cC\u201d corporation under \u201cSubchapter C\u201d of the income tax provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), which is applicable to most corporations and treats the corporation as an entity that is separate and distinct from its shareholders. If the open tax years in which State National was treated as an \u201cS\u201d corporation were audited by the Internal Revenue Service, and we are determined not to have qualified for, or to have violated, our \u201cS\u201d corporation status, we will be obligated to pay back taxes, interest and penalties, and we do not have the right to reclaim tax distributions that we have made to our shareholders during those periods. These amounts could include taxes on all of our taxable income while State National was treated as an \u201cS\u201d corporation. Any such claims could result in additional costs to us and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have entered into a tax indemnification agreement with our former \u201cS\u201d corporation shareholders and could become obligated to make payments to them for any additional federal, state or local income taxes assessed against them for fiscal periods prior to the completion of the private placement.\nIn the event of an adjustment to our reported taxable income for a period or periods prior to termination of our \u201cS\u201d corporation status, persons who held shares of our common stock during the time in which it was treated as an \u201cS\u201d corporation could be liable for additional income taxes for those prior periods. Therefore, prior to the completion of the private placement we entered into a tax indemnification agreement with our shareholders, who we refer to as our former \u201cS\u201d Corporation Shareholders. Pursuant to the tax indemnification agreement, we will pay each such shareholder on an after-tax (or grossed-up) basis the amount of additional income taxes plus interest and penalties due as a result of adjustments (pursuant to a determination by, or a settlement with, a taxing authority or court, or pursuant to the filing of an amended tax return) to the taxable income of our parent company with respect to taxable periods during which it filed as an \u201cS\u201d corporation. The payments we could be required to make will be reduced by certain tax benefits that may be available to our former \u201cS\u201d Corporation Shareholders as a result of such adjustments. Such payments will also include any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the former \u201cS\u201d Corporation Shareholders arising out of a claim for such tax liability.\nIn order to comply with the requirements of being a public company, we have enhanced and are enhancing certain of our corporate and financial processes, which requires significant company resources and management attention.\nAs a new public company with listed equity securities, we need to comply with new laws, regulations and requirements, certain corporate governance provisions of The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSarbanes-Oxley\u201d), periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and other regulations of the SEC and the requirements of the NASDAQ Global Select Market, with which we were not required to comply as a private company. In order to comply with these laws, rules and regulations, we have enhanced and are enhancing certain of our corporate processes, which requires us to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. These efforts will also require a significant amount of time from our board of directors and management, possibly diverting their attention from the implementation of our business plan and growth strategy.\nWe have made, and will continue to make, changes to our corporate governance standards, disclosure controls, financial reporting and accounting systems to meet our obligations as a public company. We cannot assure you that the changes we have made and will continue to make to satisfy our obligations as a public company will be successful, and any failure on our part to satisfy these obligations could subject us to delisting of our common stock, fines, sanctions and other regulatory action and potential litigation.\nFailure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s stock price.\nSection 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley and the related rules and regulations of the SEC require an annual management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting (subject to transition rules for newly public companies.) If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley and the related rules and regulations of the SEC. If we cannot in the future favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investor confidence in the reliability of our financial reports may be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and are likely to remain one for some period of time. As a result, our shareholders likely will not have the benefit of certain protective provisions that would otherwise apply to most public companies.\nThe JOBS Act became law in 2012. The JOBS Act \u201cIPO On-Ramp\u201d provisions provide that companies with less than $1 billion of total annual gross revenues (\u201cemerging growth companies\u201d) will be exempted from certain disclosure\nrequirements for up to five years following their initial public offerings. An emerging growth company would be subject to reduced requirements during this period, including:\n\u00b7\nfewer years of required financial statements in its registration statement (two years compared to three years by non-emerging growth companies);\n\u00b7\nno requirement to present selected financial data for periods preceding the earliest audited period required to be presented in the registration statement for a company\u2019s initial public offering;\n\u00b7\nexemption from the requirements under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for auditor attestation relating to internal control over financial reporting;\n\u00b7\ngrandfather provisions allowing a company to forgo compliance with new or revised financial statement or auditing requirements; and\n\u00b7\nreduced executive compensation disclosure, including reduction of the number of executive officers whose compensation is required to be described, fewer years of required disclosure, exemption from the requirement to include a compensation disclosure and analysis section and exemption from certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act relating to \u201csay-on-pay,\u201d \u201cpay-for-performance,\u201d comparative pay and golden parachutes.\nAs a result, for at least some period of years, our shareholders likely will not have the benefit of certain protective provisions and additional disclosures that would otherwise apply to most public companies.\nOur senior executive officers and several of our directors may not be able to organize and effectively manage a publicly traded operating company, which could adversely affect our overall financial condition.\nOur senior executive officers and a number of our directors have not served in those capacities with publicly traded operating companies and may not be successful in doing so. The demands of organizing and managing a publicly traded operating company are much greater than those relating to a private company, and some of our senior executive officers and directors may not be able to meet those increased demands. Failure to organize and effectively manage our business could materially and adversely affect our overall financial condition.\nFuture sales and issuances of shares of our capital stock may depress our share price.\nWe may in the future issue our previously authorized and unissued securities. We have an authorized capitalization of 150 million shares of our common stock and 10 million shares of preferred stock with such designations, preferences and rights as are contained in our charter or bylaws and as determined by our board of directors. Issuances of stock may result in dilution of our existing shareholders or a decrease in the per share price of our common stock. It is not possible to state the actual effect of the issuance of any shares of our preferred stock on the rights of holders of our common stock until our board of directors determines the specific rights attached to that class or series of preferred stock.\nWe cannot predict what effect, if any, future sales of our common stock, or the availability of shares for future sale, will have on the price prospective buyers are willing to pay for our common stock. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by us or our shareholders, or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect the price prospective buyers are willing to pay for our common stock and may make it more difficult for you to sell your shares at a time and price that you determine appropriate. See \u201cShares Available for Future Sale\u201d for further information regarding circumstances under which additional shares of our common stock may be sold.\nProvisions contained in our organizational documents, as well as provisions of Delaware law, contractual agreements and compensation arrangements, could delay or prevent a change of control of us, which could adversely affect the price of shares of our common stock.\nOur bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors. Our corporate governance documents include provisions that:\n\u00b7\nprovide that special meetings of our shareholders generally can only be called by the chairman of the board of directors, the chief executive officer, the president or by a resolution approved by our board of directors;\n\u00b7\nprovide our board of directors the ability to issue undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without shareholder approval, and which may grant preferred holders super voting, special approval, dividend or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holder of common stock;\n\u00b7\neliminate the ability of shareholders to act by written consent in lieu of a meeting;\n\u00b7\nprovide our board of directors the ability to issue common stock and warrants within the amount of authorized capital; and\n\u00b7\nprovide that shareholders seeking to bring business before our annual meeting of shareholders, or to nominate candidates for election as directors at our annual meeting of shareholders, generally must provide timely advance notice of their intent in writing and certain other information not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the one-year anniversary of the date of the preceding year\u2019s annual meeting of shareholders.\nIn addition, some of our agreements, such as our alliance agreement with CUNA Mutual, and some of our incentive plans contain change of control provisions. In addition, we have certain severance agreements with executives that provide for payments following a change of control.\nThe provisions discussed above, alone or together, could delay hostile takeovers and changes of control of our company or changes in our management, even if such transactions would be beneficial to our shareholders.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we will also be subject to anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law. The Delaware General Corporation Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d) provides that shareholders are not entitled to cumulative voting rights in the election of directors unless a corporation\u2019s certificate of incorporation provides otherwise. Our certificate of incorporation does not provide for cumulative voting in the election of directors.\nIn addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the DGCL, which, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits a public Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination (as defined in such section) with an \u201cinterested shareholder\u201d (defined generally as any person who beneficially owns 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of such corporation or any person affiliated with such person) for a period of three years following the time that such shareholder became an interested shareholder, unless: (1) prior to such time, the board of directors of such corporation approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the shareholder becoming an interested shareholder; (2) upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the shareholder becoming an interested shareholder, the interested shareholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of such corporation at the time the transaction commenced (excluding for purposes of determining the voting stock outstanding (but not the outstanding voting stock owned by the interested shareholder) the voting stock owned by directors who are also officers or held in employee benefit plans in which the employees do not have a confidential right to tender or vote stock held by the plan); or (3) on or subsequent to such time the business combination is approved by the board of directors of such corporation and authorized at a meeting of shareholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock of such corporation not owned by the interested shareholder.\nAny provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our shareholders to receive a premium for their shares of common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for shares of our common stock. See \u201cDescription of Capital Stock-Certain Anti-Takeover Effects of Provisions of Our Organizational Documents and Delaware Law.\u201d\nApplicable insurance laws may make it difficult to effect a change of control of our company.\nState insurance holding company laws require prior approval by the respective state insurance departments of any change of control of an insurer. \u201cControl\u201d is generally defined as the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of the Company, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise. Control is generally presumed to exist through the direct or indirect ownership of 10% or more of the voting securities of a domestic insurance company or any entity that controls a domestic insurance company. Any person wishing to acquire control of us or of any substantial portion of our outstanding shares would first be required to obtain the approval of the domestic regulators (including those asserting \u201ccommercial domicile\u201d) of our insurance subsidiaries or file appropriate disclaimers.\nThese laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent a change of control of us, including through transactions, and in particular unsolicited transactions, that some or all of our shareholders might consider to be desirable. See \u201cRegulation-Holding Company Regulation-Change of Control.\u201d\nFuture issuance of debt or preferred stock, which would rank senior to our common stock upon our liquidation, and future offerings of equity securities, which would dilute our existing shareholders, may adversely affect the market value of our common stock.\nIn the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by issuing debt or making additional offerings of equity securities, including bank debt, commercial paper, medium-term notes, senior or subordinated notes and classes of shares of preferred stock. Upon liquidation, holders of our debt securities and preferred stock and lenders with respect to other borrowings will receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of shares of our common stock. Additional equity offerings may dilute the holdings of our existing shareholders or reduce the market value of our common stock, or both. Our preferred stock, if issued, could have a preference on liquidating distributions or a preference on dividend payments that would limit amounts available for distribution to holders of shares of our common stock. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, holders of shares of our common stock bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market value of our common stock and diluting their stockholdings in us.", "PERMNO": 15083, "SIC": 6331, "TIC": "SNC"}
