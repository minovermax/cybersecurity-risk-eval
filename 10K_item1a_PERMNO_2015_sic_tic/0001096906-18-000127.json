Fortunately, the U.S. Congress suspended the MDET for the years of 2016-2019. To the extent that the Acts will in the future continue to place additional burdens on small medical device companies in the form of the excise tax on medical device sales, additional oversight of marketing and sales activities and new reporting requirements, the result is likely to continue to be negative for UTMD's ability to effectively compete and support continued investments in new product development and marketing of specialty devices in the U.S.\nIncreasing regulatory burdens including premarketing approval delays may result in significant loss of revenue, unpredictable costs and loss of management focus on helping the Company proactively conform with requirements and thrive:\nThe Company's experience in 2001-2005, when the FDA improperly sought to shut it down, highlights the ongoing risk of being subject to a regulatory environment which can be arbitrary and capricious. The risks associated with such a circumstance relate not only to the substantial costs of litigation in millions of dollars, but also loss of business, the diversion of attention of key employees for an extended period of time, including new product development and routine quality control management activities, and a tremendous psychological and emotional toll on dedicated and diligent employees.\nSince the FDA reserves to itself the interpretation of which vague industry standards comprise law at any point in time, it is impossible for any medical device manufacturer to ever be confident that it is operating within the Agency's version of the law. The unconstitutional result is that all companies, including UTMD, are considered guilty prior to proving their innocence.\nPremarketing submission administrative burdens and substantial increases in \"user fees\" increase product development costs and result in delays to revenues from new or improved devices. It recently took two and a half years to gain FDA approval of the use of a clearly safer single use Filshie Clip applicator, which had been in use for over seven years OUS, in lieu of a reused applicator approved in the U.S. since 1996, made of substantially equivalent materials for the same intended use applying the same implanted clip.\nThe growth of Group Purchasing Organizations (GPOs) adds non-productive costs, typically weakens the Company's marketing and sales efforts and may result in lower revenues:\nGPOs, theoretically acting as bargaining agents for member hospitals, but actually collecting revenues from the companies that they are negotiating with, have made a concerted effort to turn medical devices that convey special patient safety advantages and better health outcomes, like UTMD's, into undifferentiated commodities. GPOs have been granted an antitrust exemption by the U.S. Congress. Otherwise, their business model based on \"kickbacks\" would be a violation of law. These bureaucratic entities do not recognize or understand the overall cost of care as it relates to safety and effectiveness of devices, and they create a substantial administrative burden that is primarily related to collection of their administrative fees.\nThe Company's business strategy may not be successful in the future:\nAs the level of complexity and uncertainty in the medical device industry increases, evidenced, for example, by the unpredictable regulatory environment, the Company's views of the future and product/ market strategy may not yield financial results consistent with the past.\nAs the healthcare industry becomes increasingly bureaucratic it puts smaller companies like UTMD at a competitive disadvantage:\nAn aging population is placing greater burdens on healthcare systems, particularly hospitals. The length of time and number of administrative steps required in adopting new products for use in hospitals has grown substantially in recent years. Smaller companies like UTMD typically do not have the administrative resources to deal with broad new administrative requirements, resulting in either loss of revenue or increased costs. As UTMD introduces new products it believes are safer and more effective, it may find itself excluded from certain clinical users because of the existence of long term supply agreements for preexisting products, particularly from competitors which offer hospitals a broader range of products and services. Restrictions used by hospital administrators to limit clinician involvement in device purchasing decisions makes communicating UTMD's clinical advantages much more difficult.\nA product liability lawsuit could result in significant legal expenses and a large award against the Company:\nUTMD's devices are frequently used in inherently risky situations to help physicians achieve a more positive outcome than what might otherwise be the case. In any lawsuit where an individual plaintiff suffers permanent physical injury, the possibility of a large award for damages exists whether or not a causal relationship exists.\nThe Company's reliance on third party distributors in some markets may result in less predictable revenues:\nUTMD's distributors have varying expertise in marketing and selling specialty medical devices. They also sell other devices that may result in less focus on the Company's products. In some countries, notably China, Pakistan and India not subject to similarly rigorous standards, a distributor of UTMD's products may eventually become a competitor with a cheaper but lower quality version of UTMD's devices.\nThe loss of one or more key employees could negatively affect UTMD performance:\nIn a small company with limited resources, the distraction or loss of key personnel at any point in time may be disruptive to performance. The Company's benefits programs are key to recruiting and retaining talented employees. An increase in UTMD's employee healthcare plan costs, for example, may cause the Company to have to reduce coverages which in turn represents a risk to retaining key employees.\nFluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the USD can result in significant differences in period to period financial results:\nSince a significant portion of UTMD's sales are invoiced in foreign currencies and consolidated financial results are reported in USD terms, a stronger USD can have negative revenue effects. Conversely, a weaker USD would increase foreign subsidiary operating costs in USD terms. For the portion of sales to foreign entities made in fixed USD terms, a stronger USD makes the devices more expensive and weakens demand. For the portion invoiced in a foreign currency, not only USD-denominated sales are reduced, but also gross profits may be reduced because finished distributed products and/or U.S. made raw materials and components are likely being purchased in fixed USD.", "PERMNO": 79776, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "UTMD"}
