RISK FACTORS ($ in millions)\nMerger-Related Risk Factors\nFailure to consummate the Merger, or a delay in consummating the Merger, could negatively impact the market price of our common stock and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nConsummation of the Merger is subject to various customary conditions, including the receipt of specified regulatory approvals; the absence of any newly enacted law, injunction or order prohibiting the Merger; the accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement (generally subject to a material adverse effect qualification); and compliance with the covenants and agreements in the Merger Agreement in all material respects. It is possible that factors outside the control of the Company or Siemens could delay the completion of the merger, or prevent it from being completed at all. Additionally, on February 13, 2015, the Company was notified that the European Commission is initiating a phase II review of the Merger.\nIf the Merger is not consummated, our ongoing business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected and the market price of our common stock may decline significantly, particularly to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the Merger will be consummated. If the consummation of the Merger is delayed, including by a delay in receipt of necessary governmental approvals, our business, financial condition and results of operations may also be adversely affected.\nWhile the Merger Agreement is in effect, we are subject to restrictions on our business activities.\nUntil the Merger closes or the Merger Agreement is terminated, we are subject to restrictions on our business activities and must generally operate our business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice (subject to certain exceptions). These restrictions may prevent us from exploring and pursing certain business opportunities, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations should the Merger not be completed.\nStockholder litigation could prevent or delay the closing of the Merger or otherwise negatively impact our business and operations.\nWe may incur additional costs in connection with the defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation in connection with the proposed Merger. Such litigation may adversely affect our ability to complete the Merger, and could also have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe pending Merger may negatively impact our ability to recruit and retain key employees.\nEmployee retention and recruitment may be particularly challenging prior to the completion of the Merger, as employees and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the Company. If, despite our retention and recruiting efforts, key employees depart or fail to accept employment with us because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the combined company, our business operations and financial results may be adversely affected.\nAdditional Risk Factors\nEconomic recessions could adversely affect our business.\nProlonged periods of adverse global economic conditions could decrease demand for oil and gas, which in turn could result in lower prices for oil and gas. Such decreased demand and lower prices can result in lower demand for our new equipment and, to a lesser extent, aftermarket parts and services and, therefore, could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nVolatility and disruption of the credit markets may negatively impact us.\nWe intend to finance our operations and initiatives with existing cash, cash from operations, and borrowings under our senior secured credit facility (\u201cAmended Credit Facility\u201d) and other financing alternatives, if necessary. Adverse national and international economic conditions may affect our ability to fully draw upon our Amended Credit Facility and we may not be able to obtain financing at competitive pricing and terms. Further, while we believe our present liquidity is adequate for our current plans, deterioration in the credit markets or prolonged tightening of credit availability could adversely affect the ability of our clients to pay us or the ability of our suppliers to meet our needs or do so competitively, which could affect our results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nOur operating results and cash flows could be harmed because of industry downturns.\nConditions in the oil and gas industry, which affect the majority of our revenue, are highly cyclical and subject to factors beyond our control. The businesses of most of our clients, particularly oil, gas and petrochemical companies, are, to varying degrees, cyclical and historically have experienced periodic downturns. Profitability in those industries is highly sensitive to supply and demand cycles and volatile commodity prices, and our clients in those industries historically have tended to delay large capital projects, including expensive maintenance and upgrades, during industry downturns. These industry downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand, excess manufacturing capacity and subsequent accelerated erosion of average selling prices. Demand for our new units and, to a lesser extent, aftermarket parts and services is driven by a combination of long-term and cyclical trends, including increased outsourcing of services, maturing oil and gas fields, the development of technologies enabling the production of oil and gas from shale reservoirs, the aging of the worldwide installed base of equipment, gas market growth and the construction of new energy infrastructure, and regulatory factors. In addition, the growth of new unit sales is generally linked to the growth of oil and gas consumption in markets in which we operate. Moreover, new unit bookings can be highly variable due to volatile market conditions, subjectivity clients exercise in placing orders and timing of large orders.\nThere have been periods of volatility in the price of oil and gas, including the most recent decline in the latter part of 2014. Our aftermarket segment is generally a steady business and has typically been resilient through cycles. However, we believe our aftermarket bookings in the September through November period in 2014 were adversely impacted by the recent and precipitous drop in oil prices. In the new units segment, bookings have also been impacted by changes in oil prices, however, tend to be more pronounced than what we have experienced in the aftermarket segment. For example, the sudden and precipitous drops in the price of oil had a significant adverse impact on new unit bookings during the 2008 / 2009 recession and more recently in the latter part of 2014. Because of the generally long lead times required to engineer, manufacture and test new equipment before delivery, new unit revenues are generally not impacted in the short-term. Additionally, we experience in the normal course fluctuations in new unit revenues and bookings due to variability in the timing and size of very large orders, which is typical in the oil and gas industry. This occurs because our equipment, in many cases, is used in very large capital projects that take years to plan and execute, and such projects do not occur on a regular or consistent basis due to their size, location, technical resources, client capital expenditure constraints and long-term relationship to global energy supply and demand.\nProlonged periods of reduced client investment in new units could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Any significant downturn in our clients\u2019 markets or in general economic conditions could result in a reduction in demand for our products and services and could harm our business. Such downturns, including the perception that they might continue, could have a significant negative impact on the market price of our common stock and our 6 1/2% Senior Subordinated Notes (\u201cSenior Subordinated Notes\u201d).\nWe may not be successful in implementing our business strategy.\nWe estimate that we currently provide approximately 58% of the supplier-provided aftermarket parts and services needs of our own manufactured turbo products, reciprocating compressors and steam turbines, and less than 5% of the aftermarket parts and services needs of these same classes of equipment of other manufacturers. The successful implementation of our strategy depends on our ability to provide aftermarket parts and services to both our own and our competitors\u2019 installed base of equipment, to develop and maintain our alliance relationships and to maintain competitive costs. Our ability to successfully implement our aftermarket business strategy also depends to a large extent on the success of our competitors in servicing the aftermarket parts and services needs of our clients, the willingness of clients to outsource their service needs to us and general economic conditions. In addition, our ability to implement and execute our localization initiatives, globalize our gas turbine repair business, make strategic acquisitions, reduce costs and cycle times, execute large, complicated extended scope projects and enter into service contracts and new alliance agreements with national oil companies in developing countries will impact the success of our business strategy. We cannot assure you that we will succeed in implementing our strategy.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOur reliance on third-party subcontractors and suppliers may cause delays in shipments and result in significant revenue and profit deferrals.\nWe rely on other companies, including third-party subcontractors and suppliers, to provide and produce conforming raw materials, integrated components and sub-assemblies, and production commodities and to perform some of the services that we provide to our customers. If one or more of our suppliers or subcontractors experiences delivery delays, quality issues or other performance problems, we may be unable to meet timely our commitments to our clients or we may incur additional costs to do so. For example, in our new units segment, we rely on third-party suppliers for certain major pieces of equipment that are integrated into our compression packages. These finished goods are commonly referred to as \u201cbuyouts,\u201d such as large gas turbines or motors that drive our compressors. Our reliance on third-party suppliers for this equipment exposes us to price risk, the equipment made available, bundling commercial propositions and to delays resulting from a supplier\u2019s failure to deliver the equipment in a sufficiently timely manner to enable us to meet our commitments to our clients.\nIn addition, in some instances, we may have one, or a very limited number of, sources of supply for a particular material or component. Any service disruption from one of these suppliers, due to circumstances beyond the supplier\u2019s control or as a result of performance problems, financial difficulties, limited access or the inability to obtain access to certain products we incorporate in our own offerings as a result of consolidation in our industry, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet timely our commitments to our clients, increase our operating costs or limit our ability to offer our solutions to the market.\nAny delays in the delivery of necessary materials or components may delay our own deliveries of our products to our clients until subsequent quarterly or annual periods, resulting in deferral of revenue and profit recognition to those future periods. In certain instances, the deferred revenue and profit recognition could have a material adverse effect on our quarterly and/or annual financial results, and such delays could cause us reputational harm.\nWe bear the risk of cost overruns in fixed-price contracts. We may experience reduced profits or, in some cases, losses under these contracts if costs increase above our estimates.\nFor revenues earned under contracts that are fixed-price in nature, we bear the risk of paying some, if not all, of any cost overruns. Fixed-price contract amounts are established in part on cost and scheduling estimates that are based on a number of assumptions, including those about future economic conditions, prices, the availability of labor, equipment and materials and other exigencies. If these estimates prove inaccurate, there are errors or ambiguities as to contract specifications, or if circumstances change due to, among other things, unanticipated technical problems, difficulties in obtaining permits or approvals, changes in local laws or labor conditions, weather delays, changes in the costs of raw materials, or our vendors\u2019 or subcontractors\u2019 inability to perform, then cost overruns may occur and we could experience reduced profits or, in some cases, a loss for that project. If the project is significant, or there are one or more issues that impact multiple projects, cost overruns could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unsuccessful in our efforts to establish and/or maintain our compliance with the local content requirements in certain foreign countries, our financial results could be adversely affected.\nWe are required by the laws and regulations of some foreign countries, as well as the policies of or contracts with some of our clients located in foreign countries, to manufacture, package or procure a defined portion of our products in those foreign countries. These requirements are commonly referred to as \u201clocal content requirements.\u201d In order to satisfy these local content requirements, we have undertaken several localization initiatives in selected foreign countries. Some of our competitors with more significant capital resources may elect in the future to implement or expedite their own localization efforts in these countries, and those efforts may result in competitive advantages for them. Our failure to implement or successfully execute our localization initiatives, or otherwise acquire and maintain the capability to satisfy applicable local content requirements, could result in penalties and in financial underperformance. Furthermore, it could result in losing business to our competitors and/or our breaching the terms of existing agreements, potentially resulting in loss of expected profits or damages, including monetary penalties. Depending on the value to us of lost business or the amounts of any contractual penalties, these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe face intense competition that may cause us to lose market share and harm our financial performance.\nWe encounter competition in all areas of our business. The principal differentiators of competition in our markets include price, product performance and quality, product technology, client service, product lead times, global reach, brand reputation, breadth of product line and quality of aftermarket service and support. Our clients increasingly demand more technologically advanced and integrated products, and we must continue to develop our expertise and technical capabilities in order to manufacture and market these products successfully. Certain clients may be more price sensitive or favor bundling and less receptive to our value proposition of providing the lowest total life cycle costs and minimizing environmental impacts. To remain competitive, we will need to invest continuously in research and development,\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nmanufacturing, cost reduction efforts, marketing, client service and support and our sales networks. If we fail to develop and introduce new technologies or make product improvements that are accepted in the marketplace or reduce product costs, our business could be adversely affected.\nIn our aftermarket parts and services segment, we compete with our major competitors, small independent local service providers and our clients\u2019 in-house service providers. Other OEMs typically have an advantage in competing for services and upgrades to their own equipment. Failure to penetrate this market will adversely affect our ability to grow our business. In addition, our competitors are increasingly emulating our alliance strategy. Our alliance relationships are generally terminable without penalty by either party upon reasonable notice, and our failure to maintain or enter into new alliance relationships will adversely affect our ability to grow our business. Most of the other OEMs are significantly larger in terms of revenues, cash flow, and market capitalization, and they may have better access to capital than we do. Certain of these OEMs have additional products such as large gas turbines that they can offer in a bundled solution in addition to our class of equipment.\nWe may not be able to integrate successfully, or achieve the expected benefits from, our acquisitions, joint ventures or other strategic investments, which could adversely affect our results.\nWe have at times used acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic investments as a means of expanding our business to enhance returns and expect that we will continue to do so. If we do not successfully integrate our acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic investments, we may not realize expected operating improvements and synergies. Future acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic investments may require us to incur additional debt and contingent liabilities, which may materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. The acquisition and integration of companies, as well as joint ventures and other strategic investments, involve a number of risks, including:\n\u00b7\nuse of available cash, new borrowings or borrowings under our Amended Credit Facility to consummate the acquisition, joint venture or other strategic investment;\n\u00b7\ndemands on management related to the increase in our size after consummating an acquisition or other strategic investment or after establishing a joint venture;\n\u00b7\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from existing operations due to the integration of acquired companies, joint ventures or other strategic investments;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties arising from reliance on the capabilities and cooperation of joint venture partners and the management of companies in which we make other strategic investments;\n\u00b7\nour inability to control our joint venture partners, who may have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours, and who may take actions contrary to our policies or objectives or the best interests of the joint venture, including by exercising rights or failing to fulfill obligations under the applicable joint venture agreement;\n\u00b7\nintegration into our existing systems, programs and processes;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in the assimilation and retention of employees;\n\u00b7\npotential adverse effects on our operating or financial results, including those effects resulting from the failure of our joint ventures or the companies in which we make strategic investments to perform as expected, particularly those involved in new product development or emerging technologies; and\n\u00b7\nfailure to implement effective internal control, resulting in potential adverse effects on internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, which could result in material weaknesses or a failure to file our periodic reports with the SEC on a timely basis.\nWe may not be able to maintain the levels of operating efficiency that acquired companies achieved separately. Successful integration of acquired operations will depend upon our ability to manage those operations and to eliminate redundant and excess costs. We may not be able to achieve the cost reductions and other benefits that we would hope to achieve from acquisitions, joint ventures or other strategic investments, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nEconomic, political and other risks associated with worldwide sales and operations could adversely affect our business.\nBecause we manufacture and sell our products and services worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business globally. For the year ended December 31, 2014, 32% of our net revenue was derived from North America (approximately 93% of which was in the United States), 24% from Europe, 13% from the Middle East and Africa, 15% from Asia Pacific/Southern Asia and 16% from Latin America. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u00b7\nexchange controls that impact our ability to convert currencies;\n\u00b7\nchanges in a specific country\u2019s or region\u2019s political or economic conditions, particularly in developing countries;\n\u00b7\ncivil unrest in any of the countries in which we operate;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u00b7\ntariffs, other trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;\n\u00b7\nnegative consequences from changes in tax laws or the unfavorable resolution of tax assessments or audits;\n\u00b7\naging of a highly-skilled work force and difficulty in staffing and managing widespread global operations and field services;\n\u00b7\nadverse labor regulations;\n\u00b7\nrequirements relating to withholding taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries;\n\u00b7\ndifferent regimes controlling the protection of our intellectual property;\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on our ability to own or operate subsidiaries, make investments or acquire new businesses in certain jurisdictions;\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on our ability to repatriate dividends from our subsidiaries;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty in collecting international accounts receivable;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty in enforcement of contractual obligations;\n\u00b7\nnationalization of owned-assets;\n\u00b7\nunexpected transportation delays or interruptions;\n\u00b7\nchanges in regulatory requirements or government programs, including changes to subsidies, tariffs or other programs benefitting our energy generating assets;\n\u00b7\nthe burden of complying with multiple and potentially conflicting laws; and\n\u00b7\nchanges in governmental energy initiatives and their impact on the need for distributed power, or our ability to secure or renew contract awards.\nOur worldwide operations are affected by global economic and political conditions. Changes in economic or political conditions in any of the countries in which we operate could result in exchange rate movements, new currency or exchange controls or other restrictions being imposed on our operations, or expropriation.\nSome of the markets in which we operate are politically unstable and are subject to occasional civil and communal unrest. Riots, strikes, the outbreak of war or terrorist attacks in locations where we have operations or commercial interests could also adversely affect our business.\nWe have various policies that restrict or prohibit sales of our products and services into countries that are subject to various embargoes and sanctions or to countries designated as state sponsors of terrorism. In some cases, these policies are more restrictive than what is required under applicable law. Our policies are consistent with the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (\u201cITRSHRA\u201d), which expanded sanctions against Iran effective in October 2012 and instituted disclosure requirements in annual and quarterly reports for public companies engaged in, or affiliated with an entity engaged in, specified activities under the ITRSHRA. This policy was effective immediately and applied to all contracts, including those in existence on the effective date of the policy.\nThe Company\u2019s foreign subsidiaries had no sales of our products and services into countries that are subject to various embargoes and sanctions or to countries designated as state sponsors of terrorism in 2014.\nWhile the U.S. sanctions against Iran prohibit the Company and all of its subsidiaries from directly or indirectly engaging in any business activities with that country, the sanctions and embargoes involving Syria and Sudan generally do not prohibit our non-U.S. subsidiaries from transacting business in such countries; however, they may prohibit us and our domestic subsidiaries, as well as employees of our foreign subsidiaries who are U.S. persons, from participating in, approving or otherwise facilitating any aspect of the business activities in those countries.\nWe operate in some countries in which the risk of bribery and other corrupt activities is recognized and, despite our due diligence and other compliance efforts, the companies we acquire pose risks of prior corrupt practices that could adversely affect us. We have detailed policies prohibiting illegal payments and other corrupt activities and have a related comprehensive training and compliance program. However, a risk of bribery or other corrupt activities remains despite our efforts. In such circumstances, we could also face fines, sanctions and other penalties from authorities in the relevant jurisdictions, including prohibition of our participating in or curtailment of our business operations in those jurisdictions, if evidence of such bribery or other corrupt activities was found.\nFluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar and other currencies and the volatility of exchange rates may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nFluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar may adversely affect our results of operations. Because our consolidated financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, if we generate sales or earnings in other currencies the translation of those results into U.S. dollars can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those sales or earnings. In addition, our debt service requirements are primarily in U.S. dollars, even though a significant percentage of our cash flow is generated in euros or other foreign currencies. Significant changes in the value of the foreign currencies in which we\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ntransact business relative to the U.S. dollar could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to meet interest and principal payments on U.S. dollar-denominated debt, including our Senior Subordinated Notes and the U.S. dollar-denominated borrowings under our Amended Credit Facility. Significant fluctuations between currencies may also adversely affect our clients and suppliers. In addition, fluctuations in currencies relative to currencies in which our earnings are generated may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations.\nThe economic and political situation in Venezuela is subject to change. We are exposed to risks of currency devaluation in Venezuela primarily as a result of our bolivar receivable balances and any locally held cash balances included in our net monetary assets. However, we do not believe any such devaluation would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial position.\nIn addition to currency translation risks, we incur currency transaction risk whenever we or one of our subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a currency other than the local currency of the transacting entity. Given the volatility of exchange rates, we cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively manage our currency transaction and/or translation risks. Volatility in currency exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. We have purchased and may continue to purchase foreign currency hedging instruments protecting or offsetting positions in certain currencies to reduce the risk of adverse currency fluctuations on transactions, but we have not historically hedged translation risk. We have in the past experienced and believe it is likely that in the future we may experience economic loss and a negative impact on earnings as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nIf we lose our senior management or key personnel, our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nThe success of our business is largely dependent on our senior managers, as well as on our ability to attract and retain other qualified key personnel. In addition, there is significant demand in our industry for qualified engineers, mechanics and other skilled workers. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain all of our current senior management personnel and to attract and retain other necessary personnel, including qualified mechanics, engineers and other skilled workers, necessary for the development of our business and the replacement of an aging, highly-skilled work force. The loss of the services of senior management and other key personnel or the failure to attract additional personnel as required could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEnvironmental compliance costs and liabilities and responses to concerns regarding climate change could affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows adversely.\nOur operations and properties are subject to stringent U.S. and foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including laws and regulations governing the investigation and clean-up of contaminated properties as well as air emissions, water discharges, waste management and disposal and workplace health and safety. Such laws and regulations affect a significant percentage of our operations, are continually changing, are generally different in every jurisdiction and can impose substantial fines and sanctions for violations. Further, they may require substantial clean-up costs for our properties (many of which are sites of long-standing manufacturing operations) and the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases. We must conform our operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all jurisdictions as these requirements change.\nWe routinely deal with natural gas, oil and other petroleum products. As a result of our manufacturing and services operations, we generate, manage and dispose of, or recycle hazardous wastes and substances such as solvents, thinner, waste paint, waste oil, wash-down wastes and sandblast material. Hydrocarbons or other hazardous substances or wastes may have been disposed or released on, under or from properties owned, leased or operated by us or on, under or from other locations where such substances or wastes have been taken for disposal. These properties may be subject to investigatory, clean-up and monitoring requirements under U.S. and foreign, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Such liability may be imposed without regard to the legality of the original actions and without regard to whether we knew of, or were responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances, and such liability may be joint and several with other parties. If the liability is joint and several, we could be responsible for payment of the full amount of the liability, whether or not any other responsible party also is liable.\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, both operating and capital costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations, including the clean-up and investigation of some of our properties as well as offsite disposal locations. In addition, although we believe our operations are in compliance with environmental laws and regulations and that we are indemnified by Ingersoll Rand, our former parent company, and the sellers of Guascor for certain contamination and compliance costs (subject to certain exceptions and limitations), new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination, the imposition\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nof new clean-up requirements, new claims for property damage or personal injury arising from environmental matters or the refusal and/or inability of Ingersoll Rand or the sellers of Guascor to meet their indemnification obligations could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe also expect that scientific examination of and political attention to issues surrounding the existence and extent of climate change will continue. A variety of regulatory developments, both domestic and international, have been introduced that are focused on restricting or managing the emission of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases. These developments and further legislation that may be enacted or the development or changes within international accords could adversely affect our operations and the demand for or suitability of our products and services.\nNew regulations related to certain minerals, known as \u201cconflict minerals,\u201d could adversely impact our business.\nCompliance with conflict minerals rules promulgated by the SEC in August 2012 has and will continue to result in increased costs related to investigations to determine the sources of raw materials used in our products, and to any resulting changes to products, processes or sources of supply. The implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products. We rely on the representations of our suppliers, which may not be accurate. As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering \u201cconflict free\u201d conflict minerals, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary conflict minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, we may face reputational challenges or potentially an adverse impact on our sales if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we may implement.\nFailure to maintain a safety performance that is acceptable to our clients could result in the loss of future business.\nOur U.S. clients are heavily regulated by the Occupational Safety & Health Administration concerning workplace safety and health. Our clients have very high expectations regarding safety and health issues and require us to maintain safety performance records for our worldwide operations, field services, repair centers, sales and manufacturing plants. Our clients often insist that our safety performance equal or exceed their safety performance requirements. Most of our major clients have safety performance criteria for their suppliers in order to be qualified for their \u201capproved suppliers\u201d list. If we fail to meet a client\u2019s safety performance requirements, we may be removed from that client\u2019s approved supplier database and precluded from bidding on future business opportunities with that client.\nWe maintain a database to measure our monthly and annual safety performance and track our incident rates. Our incident rates help us identify and track accident trends, determine root causes, formulate corrective actions and implement preventive initiatives. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in maintaining or exceeding our clients\u2019 requirements regarding safety performance or that we will not lose the opportunity to bid on certain contracts.\nOur business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had approximately 7,900 employees worldwide. Of our employees, approximately 52% are located in the U.S. Approximately 30% of our employees in the U.S. are covered by collective bargaining agreements including operations in Olean, Painted Post and Wellsville, N.Y., and in Burlington, Iowa. A collective bargaining agreement will expire at our Wellsville facility in August 2015. We have an agreement with the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America whereby we hire skilled trade workers on a contract-by-contract basis in many parts of the U.S. Our contract with the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America can be terminated by either party with 90 days\u2019 prior written notice. Furthermore, approximately 47% of our employees outside of the U.S. belong to industry or national labor unions. Our operations in the following international locations are unionized with agreements negotiated annually: Le Havre, France; Peterborough, UK; Oberhausen and Bielefeld, Germany; Zumaia and Minano, Spain; Kongsberg, Norway; and Naroda, India. Although we believe that our relations with our represented employees are good, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements, that such negotiations will not result in significant increases in the cost of labor or that a breakdown in such negotiations will not result in the disruption of our operations.\nSecurity threats and sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to our information systems, networks, products and services.\nWe rely upon information systems and networks in connection with a variety of business activities, and we collect and store sensitive data. Information system security threats and sophisticated computer crime, including advanced persistent threats, pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. A failure of or breach in security could expose the Company and our clients and suppliers to risks of misuse of information or systems, the compromising of confidential information, manipulation and destruction of data, defective\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nproducts, production downtimes and operations disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, competitive position, relationships with our clients and our business and results of operations. In addition, such breaches in security could result in litigation, regulatory action and potential liability and the costs and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures.\nWe may be faced with product claims or adverse consequences of regulations as a result of the hazardous applications in which our products are used.\nBecause some of our products are used in systems that handle volatile, toxic or hazardous substances, a failure or alleged failure of certain of our products have resulted in, and in the future could result in, claims against our Company for product liability, including property damage, personal injury damage, wrongful death, pollution and other environmental damage, and consequential damages. These risks may expose our clients to liability. If our clients suffer damages as a result of the occurrence of such events, they may reduce their business with us. Further, we may be subject to potentially material liabilities relating to claims alleging personal injury as a result of hazardous substances incorporated into our products. Furthermore, a claim could be made for the adverse consequences of environmental contamination under various regulations. Such claims could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flow.\nThird parties may infringe our intellectual property or we may infringe the intellectual property of third parties, and we may expend significant resources enforcing or defending our rights or suffer competitive injury.\nWe rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. If we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could suffer, which could harm our operating results. We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights. Similarly, if we were to infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, our competitive position could suffer. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that any pending patent application or trademark application held by us will result in an issued patent or registered trademark, or that any issued or registered patents or trademarks will not be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or rendered unenforceable. Also, others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology, duplicate or reverse engineer our technology or design around the patents owned or licensed by us.\nLitigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary information, or to defend against claims by third parties that our products infringe their intellectual property rights. Any litigation or claims brought by or against us, whether with or without merit, or whether successful or not, could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Any intellectual property litigation or claims against us could result in the loss or compromise of our intellectual property and proprietary rights, subject us to significant liabilities, require us to seek licenses on unfavorable terms, prevent us from manufacturing or selling products and require us to redesign or, in the case of trademark claims, rename our products, any of which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business may be adversely affected if we encounter difficulties as we implement an Oracle-based information management system.\nWe are in the process of implementing an Oracle-based information management system across our worldwide operations. We have implemented the system in various locations representing approximately 70% of our business operations based on revenues in 2014. Although the transition to date has proceeded without any material adverse effects, a disruption in the implementation or the related procedures or controls could adversely affect both our internal and disclosure controls and harm our business, including our ability to forecast or make sales, manage our supply chain and coordinate production. Moreover, such a disruption could result in unanticipated costs or expenditures and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nPrior to implementing Oracle at certain of our locations, we are operating legacy operational and financial systems and have risks inherent with running these older systems, such as limited vendor support, declining in-house knowledge of the systems and manual processes to compensate for system limitations. While we have processes and procedures to mitigate these risks, we cannot guarantee the continued operation of these legacy systems would not cause disruption in the business or affect our internal and disclosure controls.\nOur brand name may be subject to confusion.\nOur Company\u2019s name and principal mark is a combination of the names of our founder companies, Dresser Industries, Inc. and Ingersoll Rand. We have acquired rights to use the \u201cRand\u201d portion of our principal mark from Ingersoll Rand, and the rights to use the \u201cDresser\u201d portion of our name from Dresser, Inc., the successor of Dresser Industries, Inc. and now a\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nwholly-owned subsidiary of General Electric Company. If we lose the right to use either the \u201cDresser\u201d or \u201cRand\u201d portion of our name, our ability to maintain our brand identity could be negatively affected.\nWe require a significant amount of cash to operate our business and to service our indebtedness. Our ability to generate cash and access capital on reasonable terms and conditions depends on many factors beyond our control.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt, and to fund planned capital expenditures and research and development efforts, will depend on our ability to generate cash and to access capital. Our ability to generate cash is subject to economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that may be beyond our control, including the creditworthiness or priorities of certain of our customers. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our Amended Credit Facility, under additional or renewed uncommitted lines of credit or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt, or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity. We might be unable to access the full amount of borrowings available under our Amended Credit Facility, which depends in part on the financial condition of the financial institutions participating in our Amended Credit Facility. We might be unable to refinance any of our debt, including our Amended Credit Facility or our Senior Subordinated Notes, on commercially reasonable terms.\nThe covenants in our Amended Credit Facility and the indenture governing our Senior Subordinated Notes impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility.\nOur Amended Credit Facility and the indenture governing our Senior Subordinated Notes contain a number of significant restrictions and covenants that limit our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to:\n\u00b7\ncreate, incur or permit liens;\n\u00b7\nborrow money, guarantee debt and sell certain types of preferred stock;\n\u00b7\npay dividends;\n\u00b7\nmake redemptions and repurchases of certain capital stock;\n\u00b7\nmake capital expenditures and specified types of investments;\n\u00b7\npre-pay, redeem or repurchase, or make amendments to, certain subordinated debt, including our Senior Subordinated Notes;\n\u00b7\nsell assets or engage in acquisitions, mergers, consolidations and asset dispositions;\n\u00b7\nchange the nature of our business;\n\u00b7\nenter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends; and\n\u00b7\nengage in affiliate transactions.\nThe Amended Credit Facility also requires us to comply with specified financial ratios and tests, including, but not limited to, a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio.\nMaintaining compliance with these covenants could have a material adverse effect on our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs. Furthermore, they may restrict our ability to expand, pursue our business strategies and otherwise conduct our business. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by circumstances and events beyond our control, such as economic conditions and changes in regulations, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to comply. A breach of these covenants could result in a default under the indenture governing our Senior Subordinated Notes and/or the Amended Credit Facility. If there were an event of default under the indenture governing our Senior Subordinated Notes and/or the Amended Credit Facility, the affected creditors could cause all amounts borrowed under these instruments to be due and payable immediately. Additionally, if we fail to repay indebtedness under our Amended Credit Facility when it becomes due, the lenders under the Amended Credit Facility could proceed against the assets and capital stock which we have pledged to them as security. Our assets and cash flow might not be sufficient to repay our outstanding debt in the event of a default.\nOur pension expenses and funding requirements are affected by factors outside our control, including the performance of plan assets, interest rates, actuarial data and experience and changes in laws and regulations.\nOur future funding obligations for our U.S. defined benefit pension plans qualified with the Internal Revenue Service depend upon the level of benefits provided by the plans, the future performance of assets set aside in trusts for these plans, the level of interest rates used to determine funding levels, actuarial experience and changes in government laws and regulations. If the market value of securities held by the plan trusts declines, our pension expense would increase and, as a result, could adversely affect our financial results. Decreases in interest rates that are not offset by contributions and asset returns could also increase our obligation under such plans. Such factors and the statutory funding requirements of various countries in which we sponsor pension plans may legally require us to make contributions to our pension plans in the future, and those contributions could be material. In addition, if local authorities increase the minimum funding\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nrequirements for our pension plans, we could be required to contribute more funds, which would negatively affect our cash flow and liquidity.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile.\nSecurities markets worldwide experience significant price and volume fluctuations. This market volatility, as well as general economic, market or political conditions, could reduce the market price of our publicly traded securities in spite of our operating performance. In addition, our operating results could be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, and in response, the market price of our securities could decrease significantly. Among other factors that could affect the price of our securities are:\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in operating results, which may be caused by, among other things, variability in the timing and size of very large orders and shipments in the new units segment;\n\u00b7\nchanges in opinions and earnings and other financial estimates by securities analysts;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated changes in economic, political or market conditions, such as regime and / or leadership changes, recessions, depressions or international currency fluctuations;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated changes in the regulatory environment affecting our industry;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the market valuations of our industry peers; and\n\u00b7\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, divestitures, joint ventures, new products and technologies or other strategic initiatives.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, stockholders have often instituted class action securities litigation against those companies. Such litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management attention and resources, which could significantly harm our profitability and reputation.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws and Delaware law may discourage a takeover attempt.\nProvisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us. Provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws and Delaware law impose various procedural and other requirements, which could make it more difficult for stockholders to effect certain corporate actions. For example, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to determine the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of unissued series of preferred stock, without any vote or action by our stockholders. Thus, our board of directors can, and did on September 21, 2014, authorize and issue shares of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of our common stock, which rights will expire on September 22, 2015, if not sooner. These rights may have the effect of delaying or deterring a change of control of our Company. These provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. These rights are more fully described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included herein in Item 15 Exhibits, Financial Statements and Schedules.", "PERMNO": 90831, "SIC": 3510, "TIC": "DRC"}
