RISK FACTORS\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND OUR CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe will need additional capital to fund our operations and continue as a going concern. If we are unable to obtain sufficient capital, we will need to curtail and reduce our operations and costs, and modify our business strategy.\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents and the receipt of license fees, milestone payments, research and development funding and royalty income from our collaboration partners. As of June 30, 2017, our cash and cash equivalents were $16.9 million. We believe that our existing capital resources, together with expected payments from existing collaborations, should enable us to fund our operations as currently planned through approximately the first quarter of calendar year 2018. However, changing circumstances may cause us to consume capital faster than we currently anticipate, and we may need to spend more money than currently expected because of such circumstances. Our ability to fund our planned operations beyond that time, including completing clinical development and obtaining regulatory approvals for Durasert three-year uveitis and continuing our research and development program for our other product candidates, will require additional capital. In addition, our current plan to commercialize Durasert three-year uveitis ourselves in the United States will require significant operating cost investment related to product manufacturing, marketing, sales, distribution and other commercialization costs.\nTo meet our capital needs, we are considering multiple alternatives, including but not limited to, equity financings, debt financings, corporate collaborations, partnerships and other strategic transactions and funding opportunities. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any one or more of such transactions on acceptable terms or otherwise. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. As a result, our independent registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph in its report on our financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2017 related to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nIf we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we will need to curtail and reduce our operations and costs, and modify our business strategy which may require us to, among other things:\n\u2022\nsignificantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of one or more of our product candidates or one or more of our other research and development initiatives;\n\u2022\nseek collaborators for one or more of our current or future product candidates at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available;\n\u2022\nsell or license on unfavorable terms our rights to technologies or product candidates that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves; or\n\u2022\nseek to sell our company at an earlier stage than would otherwise be desirable or on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available.\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception, have not generated significant revenue from commercial sales of our products and, with exception of fiscal year 2010 and fiscal year 2015, we have never been profitable. Investment in drug development is highly speculative because it entails substantial upfront operating expenses and significant risk that a product candidate will fail to successfully complete clinical trials, gain regulatory approval or become commercially viable. We continue to incur significant research, development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations, including development of our lead product candidate and other early stage and/or potential product candidates. For the year ended June 30, 2017, we had a net loss of $18.5 million, and we had a total accumulated deficit of $310.8 million at June 30, 2017.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that our expenses will continue to be significant if, and as, we:\n\u2022\ncontinue the research and pre-clinical and clinical development of our product candidates;\n\u2022\ninitiate additional pre-clinical, clinical or other studies or trials for our product candidates;\n\u2022\nfurther develop the manufacturing process for our product candidates;\n\u2022\nchange or add additional manufacturers or suppliers;\n\u2022\nseek regulatory approvals for our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;\n\u2022\nestablish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval and for which we intend to commercialize ourselves;\n\u2022\nseek to identify and validate additional product candidates;\n\u2022\nacquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies;\n\u2022\nmaintain, protect and expand our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022\nattract and retain skilled personnel;\n\u2022\ncreate additional infrastructure to support our product development and planned future commercialization efforts; and\n\u2022\nexperience any delays or encounter issues with any of the above.\nThe net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year, such that a period-to-period comparison of our results of operations may not be a good indication of our future performance. In any particular quarter or quarters, our operating results could be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe may never achieve profitability from future operations.\nOur ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability depends on our ability, alone or with strategic collaboration partners, to successfully complete the development of, and obtain the regulatory approvals necessary for, the manufacture and commercialization of our product candidates. Since inception, we have financed our operations primarily from sales of our equity securities and payments received under collaboration agreements. We do not have any assured sources of revenue. To become and remain profitable, we and/or our licensees must succeed in developing and commercializing products that generate significant revenue. This will require us or our licensees to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including completing pre-clinical testing and clinical trials of our product candidates, discovering additional product candidates, obtaining regulatory approval for these product candidates, manufacturing, marketing and selling any products for which we or our licensees may obtain regulatory approval, satisfying any post-marketing requirements and obtaining reimbursement for our products from private insurance or government payors. To date, none of our approved licensed products, including Vitrasert, Retisert and ILUVIEN, has generated significant revenues to us from sales. Of our product candidates, only Durasert three-year uveitis is in late-stage development. We may never succeed in these activities and, even if we do, we may never generate revenues significant enough to achieve profitability. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development and commercialization, we are unable to accurately project when or if we will be able to achieve profitability from operations. Even if we do so, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would depress the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our research and development efforts, diversify our product offerings or even continue our operations.\nWe will need to raise additional funds in the future, which may not be available on favorable terms and may be dilutive to stockholders or impose operational restrictions.\nWe will need to raise additional capital in the future to help fund our clinical trials and for the development and commercialization of our product candidates. The amount of additional capital we will require will be influenced by many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe amount of future revenues we receive with respect to the commercialization of ILUVIEN for DME and, if approved in the EMEA, ILUVIEN for posterior segment uveitis;\n\u2022\nthe timing, cost and success of our clinical development, regulatory approval and planned direct U.S. commercialization of Durasert three-year uveitis;\n\u2022\nwhether and to what extent we internally fund, whether and when we initiate, and how we conduct other product development programs;\n\u2022\nthe amount of Retisert royalties and other payments we receive under collaboration agreements;\n\u2022\nwhether and when we are able to enter into strategic arrangements for our product candidates and the nature of those arrangements;\n\u2022\ntimely and successful development, regulatory approval and commercialization of other potential product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing any patent claims;\n\u2022\nchanges in our operating plan, resulting in increases or decreases in our need for capital;\n\u2022\nour views on the availability, timing and desirability of raising capital; and\n\u2022\nthe costs of operating as a public company.\nWe do not know if additional capital will be available to us when needed or on terms favorable to us or our stockholders. Collaboration, licensing or other commercial agreements may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. We do not know the extent to which we will receive funds from the commercialization of ILUVIEN or Retisert. If we seek to sell our equity securities under our at-the-market (\u201cATM\u201d) program or in another offering, we do not know whether and to what extent we will be able to do so, or on what terms. Further, the rules and regulations of the Australian Securities Exchange (\u201cASX\u201d) and the NASDAQ Stock Market (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d) require us to obtain shareholder approval for sales of our equity securities under certain circumstances, which could delay or prevent us from raising additional capital from such sales. Also, the state of the economy and financial and credit markets at the time or times we seek any additional financing may make it more difficult or more expensive to obtain. If available, additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders, debt financing may involve restrictive covenants or other unfavorable terms and dilute our existing stockholders\u2019 equity, and funding through collaboration, licensing or other commercial agreements may be on unfavorable terms, including requiring us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or products. If adequate financing is not available if and when needed, we may delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate research or development programs, planned independent U.S. commercialization of Durasert three-year uveitis or other new products, if any, postpone or cancel the pursuit of product candidates, including pre-clinical and clinical trials and new business opportunities, reduce staff and operating costs, or otherwise significantly curtail our operations to reduce our cash requirements and extend our capital.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of June 30, 2017, we had U.S. net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards of approximately $92.6 million for U.S. federal income tax and approximately $51.6 million of state income tax purposes available to offset future taxable income and U.S. federal and state research and development tax credits of approximately $1.2 million, prior to consideration of annual limitations that may be imposed under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (\u201cSection 382\u201d). The U.S. NOL carryforwards begin to expire in 2023 if not utilized.\nOur U.S. NOL and tax credit carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. Under Section 382, and corresponding provisions of U.S. state law, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50% change, by value, in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change U.S. NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research and development tax credits, to offset its post-change income may be limited. Our most recent analyses under Section 382 were performed in 2014 and we cannot forecast or otherwise determine our ability to derive benefit from our various federal or state tax attribute carryforwards. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change U.S. NOL carryforwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of U.S. NOLs is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed.\nIn addition, we may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, including through completed or contemplated financings, some of which may be outside of our control. If we determine that an ownership change has occurred and our ability to use our historical net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards is materially limited, it would harm our future operating results by effectively increasing our future tax obligations.\nThere is no assurance our Retisert royalty income will continue at current levels or at all.\nOur Retisert royalty income, which had ranged between $1.2 million and $1.4 million from fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2016, decreased to $970,000 for fiscal 2017. We do not expect Retisert royalty income to increase materially, if at all, and it may decline further or cease. Bausch & Lomb\u2019s obligation to pay a royalty terminates on a licensed product by licensed product basis and country by country basis upon the date that the last to expire patent expires. The patent with which Retisert is marked expires in March 2019. The latest patent covering Retisert expires in April 2020, and we will not receive any Retisert royalty income after that time. Bausch & Lomb previously ceased selling Vitrasert on its patent expiration.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly from period to period.\nOur operating results have fluctuated significantly from period to period in the past and may continue to do so in the future due to many factors, including:\n\u2022\ncosts of internally funded research and development, including CROs and other costs related to clinical development and costs of pre-clinical studies and research;\n\u2022\ndevelopments with respect to our products and product candidates, both licensed and independently developed, including pre-clinical and clinical trial data and results, regulatory developments and marketing and sales results;\n\u2022\ntiming, receipt and amount of revenues, including receipt and recognition of collaborative research and development, licensing, milestone, royalty and other payments;\n\u2022\nannouncement, execution, amendment and termination of collaboration and other commercial agreements;\n\u2022\nscope, duration and success of collaboration and other commercial agreements;\n\u2022\ngeneral and industry-specific adverse economic conditions that may affect, among other things, our and our collaborators\u2019 operations and financial results; and\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting estimates, policies or principles and intangible asset impairments.\nDue to fluctuations in our operating results, quarterly comparisons of our financial results may not necessarily be meaningful, and investors should not rely upon such results as an indication of future performance. In addition,\ninvestors may react adversely if our reported operating results are less favorable than in a prior period or are less favorable than those anticipated by investors in the financial community, which may result in decreases in our stock price.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE REGULATORY APPROVAL AND CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATES\nWe are substantially dependent on the success of our lead product candidate, Durasert three-year uveitis, which is in a later stage of development than our other product candidates. To the extent regulatory approval of Durasert three-year uveitis is delayed or not granted, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected and the price of our common stock may decline.\nWe are focusing a significant portion of our activities and resources on our lead product candidate, Durasert three-year uveitis, and we believe our prospects are highly dependent on, and a significant portion of the value of our company relates to, our ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and commercialize Durasert three-year uveitis in the U.S. The U.S. regulatory approval of Durasert three-year uveitis is subject to many risks, including the risks discussed in other risk factors set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and Durasert three-year uveitis may not receive marketing approval from the FDA. If the results or timing of regulatory filings, the regulatory process, regulatory developments, any additional clinical trials or pre-clinical studies, or other activities, actions or decisions related to Durasert three-year uveitis do not meet our or others\u2019 expectations, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly.\nWe plan to submit an NDA for Durasert three-year uveitis with the FDA in late December 2017 or early January 2018. Although we have discussed our clinical development plans with the FDA, the agency may ultimately determine that our Phase 3 clinical trials or other aspects of our NDA are not sufficient for regulatory approval and may issue a CRL instead of approval. If we receive a CRL, the FDA would outline deficiencies in our NDA and may request the submission of additional information, including clinical data. The FDA will also inspect our facilities, the facilities of our third-party manufacturers, and may also inspect one or more of our clinical trial sites. If any facility or site reveals anomalies or does not otherwise have a satisfactory inspection, the FDA could delay or preclude approval of our NDA. In either case, our commercialization of Durasert three-year uveitis in the U.S. may be delayed and we may incur additional costs and be required to devote additional resources to address the FDA\u2019s concerns. If the FDA requires us to conduct additional clinical trials or studies, or requires our manufacturers to improve or change their practices, our timeline for commercialization of Durasert three-year uveitis in the U.S. will be delayed and we will incur additional costs. Further, there can be no assurance that we will complete such studies or clinical trials or address manufacturing issues in a manner that is acceptable to the FDA.\nIn addition, one of our collaborators, Alimera, holds an exclusive license to Durasert three-year uveitis in the EMEA under the ILUVIEN trademark. Alimera plans to apply for an additional indication, ILUVIEN for posterior segment uveitis, under its existing MAA, through the MAA variation process. Obtaining regulatory approval for such a variation is uncertain and Alimera may fail to obtain the approval. The MAA variation review processes and the processes of other regulatory authorities, are extensive, lengthy, expensive, and uncertain, and such regulatory authorities may delay, limit, or deny approval of ILUVIEN for posterior segment uveitis.\nAny delay or setback in the development or regulatory approval of Durasert three-year uveitis will adversely affect our business and could cause our stock price to decline. Should our recent Phase 3 clinical development program be insufficient to support regulatory approval, we may be forced to rely on our other product candidates, which are at a much earlier development stage and will require significant additional time and resources to conduct clinical development, obtain regulatory approval and proceed with commercialization.\nThere is no assurance that data we plan to submit in support of our planned NDA for Durasert three-year uveitis will be acceptable to the FDA and accordingly that U.S. marketing authorization for Durasert three-year uveitis will be granted.\nWe plan to file our NDA for Durasert three-year uveitis on results from our two Phase 3 clinical trials. While each of the two trials met its primary efficacy endpoint with statistical significance and showed encouraging safety results, we conducted our first Phase 3 study in both the U.S. and five other countries (U.K., Germany, Hungary, Israel and India) and we conducted our second Phase 3 clinical trial of Durasert three-year uveitis in India. In general, the FDA accepts data from clinical trials conducted outside the United States; however, acceptance of this data is subject to, among other things, the clinical trials being conducted and performed by qualified investigators in accordance with GCP principles. The trial population must also adequately represent the U.S. population, and the data must be applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice in ways that the FDA deems clinically meaningful. In addition, while our Phase 3 clinical trials are subject to applicable local laws, FDA acceptance of the data from both trials will depend on its determination that they were conducted in accordance with all applicable U.S. laws and regulations.\nWe plan to submit data from a study of the safety and utilization of two different inserters for Durasert three-year uveitis in support of our NDA, and the FDA may require an additional study of such inserter we have proposed for U.S. commercial use.\nThe FDA has significant discretion in determining whether to accept an NDA for review and what data to require for review, and there is no assurance that the FDA will find the design of our clinical trials or the data we include in an NDA to be sufficient to accept the NDA for review or to approve the NDA. The refusal of the FDA to accept our marketing application for review or their requirements for additional data or trials could delay the timing, increase the expense or render impractical continued pursuit of potential marketing approval of Durasert three-year uveitis in the U.S. Delay in or inability to obtain marketing approval for Durasert three-year uveitis in the U.S. could materially and adversely affect our business and the price of our common stock.\nThe regulatory approval processes of the FDA or other foreign regulatory authorities are lengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable, and if we are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, our business will be substantially harmed.\nThe time required to obtain approval by the FDA or other foreign regulatory authorities is unpredictable, but typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory agency. In addition, approval policies, regulations, or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate\u2019s clinical development. It is possible that none of our existing product candidates or any product candidates we may seek to develop in the future will ever obtain regulatory approval.\nOur product candidates could fail to receive regulatory approval for many reasons, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe regulatory authority may not accept our filing application;\n\u2022\nthe regulatory authority may disagree with the design, scope or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the regulatory authority that a product candidate is safe and effective for its proposed indication; we may be unable to demonstrate that a product candidate\u2019s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;\n\u2022\nthe regulatory authority may disagree with our interpretation of data from pre-clinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates may not be sufficient to support the submission of a drug application or marketing authorization;\n\u2022\nthe regulatory authority may fail to approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical and commercial supplies; and\n\u2022\nthe approval policies or regulations of the regulatory authority may change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.\nWe cannot be certain that any of our current product candidates will receive regulatory approval. If we do not receive regulatory approval for our product candidates, we may not be able to continue our operations.\nDelays in clinical trials are common and have many causes, and any delay could result in increased costs to us and jeopardize or delay our ability to obtain regulatory approval and commence product sales.\nOther than Durasert three-year uveitis, which is in late-stage clinical development, all of our product development is at earlier stages. Product development at all stages involves a high degree of risk, and only a small proportion of research and development programs result in product candidates that advance to pivotal clinical trials or result in approved products. There is no assurance that any feasibility study agreements we have, or enter into, with third parties, or our own research and development programs and collaborations will result in any new product candidates, or that we or any licensees will commence clinical trials for any new product candidates or continue clinical trials once commenced. If clinical trials conducted by or for us or any licensees for any product candidates do not provide the necessary evidence of safety and efficacy, those product candidates will not receive the necessary regulatory approvals, cannot be sold, and will not generate revenues for us.\nWe may also experience delays in clinical trials of our product candidates or the time required to complete clinical trials for our product candidates may be longer than anticipated. Our future clinical trials may not begin on time, have an effective design, enroll a sufficient number of patients, or be completed on schedule, if at all. Our clinical trials can be delayed, or even terminated, for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\ndecisions not to pursue development of product candidates due to pre-clinical or clinical trial results;\n\u2022\nlack of sufficient funding;\n\u2022\ninability to attract clinical investigators for trials;\n\u2022\ninability to recruit patients in sufficient numbers or at the expected rate;\n\u2022\ndecisions by licensees not to exercise options for products or not to pursue or promote products licensed to them;\n\u2022\nadverse side effects;\n\u2022\nfailure of trials to demonstrate safety and efficacy;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet FDA or other regulatory agency requirements for clinical trial design, or inadequate clinical trial design;\n\u2022\ninability to follow patients adequately after treatment;\n\u2022\nchanges in the design or manufacture of a product candidate;\n\u2022\nfailures by, changes in our (or our licensees\u2019) relationship with, or other issues at, CROs, vendors and investigators responsible for pre-clinical testing and clinical trials;\n\u2022\nimposition of a clinical hold following an inspection of our clinical trial operations or trial sites by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\ninability to obtain supplies and/or to manufacture sufficient quantities of materials for use in clinical trials;\n\u2022\nstability issues with clinical materials;\n\u2022\nfailure to comply with good laboratory practices, good clinical practices, current good manufacturing practices or similar foreign regulatory requirements that affect the conduct of pre-clinical and clinical studies and the manufacturing of product candidates;\n\u2022\nrequests by regulatory authorities for additional data or clinical trials;\n\u2022\ngovernmental or regulatory agency assessments of pre-clinical or clinical testing that differ from our (or our licensees\u2019) interpretations or conclusions;\n\u2022\ngovernmental or regulatory delays, or changes in approval policies or regulations; and\n\u2022\ndevelopments, clinical trial results and other factors with respect to competitive products and treatments.\nIf clinical trials for our product candidates are delayed for any of the above reasons or other reasons, our development costs may increase, our approval process could be delayed and our ability to commercialize our product candidates could be materially harmed.\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited financial and managerial resources, we focus on research programs and product candidates for specific indications. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products.\nWe have based our research and development efforts primarily on our Durasert technology platform to develop proprietary sustained-release pharmaceutical products for the treatment of posterior uveitis and other chronic eye diseases. As a result of pursuing the development of product candidates using our proprietary technologies, we may fail to develop product candidates or address indications based on other scientific approaches that may offer greater commercial potential or for which there is a greater likelihood of success. Research programs to identify new product candidates require substantial technical, financial and human resources. These research programs may initially show promise in identifying potential product candidates, yet fail to yield product candidates for clinical development.\nInitial results from a clinical trial do not ensure that the trial will be successful and success in early stage clinical trials does not ensure success in later-stage clinical trials.\nResults from pre-clinical testing, early clinical trials, investigator-sponsored studies and other data and indications often do not accurately predict final pivotal clinical trial results. In addition, data from one pivotal clinical trial may not be predictive of the results of other pivotal clinical trials for the same product candidate, even if the trial designs are the same or similar. Data obtained from pre-clinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations, which may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Data from pre-clinical studies, other clinical trials and interim periods in multi-year trials are preliminary and may change, and final data from pivotal trials for such products may differ significantly. Adverse side effects may develop that delay, limit or prevent the regulatory approval of products, or cause such regulatory approvals to be limited or even rescinded. Additional trials necessary for approval may not be undertaken or may ultimately fail to establish the safety and efficacy of our product candidates.\nIn addition, while the clinical trials of our product candidates are designed based on the available relevant information, in view of the uncertainties inherent in drug development, such clinical trials may not be designed with focus on indications, patient populations, dosing regimens, safety or efficacy parameters or other variables that will provide the necessary safety or efficacy data to support regulatory approval to commercialize the resulting product candidates. In addition, individual patient responses to the dose administered of a product candidate may vary in a manner that is difficult to predict. Also, the methods we select to assess particular safety or efficacy parameters may not yield statistical precision in estimating our product candidates\u2019 effects on study\nparticipants. Even if we believe the data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates are promising, these data may not be sufficient to support approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities. Pre-clinical and clinical data can be interpreted in different ways. Accordingly, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities could interpret these data in different ways from us or our partners, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval.\nChanges in regulatory requirements and guidance may occur and we may need to amend clinical trial protocols submitted to applicable regulatory authorities to reflect these changes. Amendments may require us to resubmit clinical trial protocols to institutional review boards or ethics committees for re-examination, which may impact the costs, timing or successful completion of a clinical trial.\nThe FDA\u2019s and other regulatory authorities\u2019 policies may change, and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our other product candidates. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained.\nIf we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other studies with respect to our product candidates beyond those that we currently contemplate, or if we are unable to successfully complete our clinical trials or other studies, we may be delayed in obtaining regulatory approval of any of our product candidates, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval at all or we may obtain approval of indications that are not as broad as intended. Our product development costs will also increase if we experience delays in testing or approvals, and we may not have sufficient funding to complete the testing and approval process for our product candidates. Significant clinical trial delays could allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to commercialize our products if and when approved. If any of this occurs, our business would be harmed.\nWe do not know if our product candidate for severe knee osteoarthritis in collaboration with HSS will be safe and effective, will ever enter pivotal clinical trials or will become an approved product or be commercialized.\nOur product candidate for severe knee OA in collaboration with HSS is the subject of an investigator-sponsored, open-label, one-dose, safety and tolerability Phase 1 clinical trial. We do not know what the final results of that clinical trial will be, whether we will be able to develop a product candidate for this indication to eventually enter into later-stage clinical trials, whether we will commence or successfully complete any such trials or whether we will obtain regulatory approvals for a product for this indication. Although we believe we will be able to do so, there is no assurance that we will be able to design a product with a longer treatment duration than six months, that we will be able to create a refillable implant or that the product, even if successful for severe knee osteoarthritis, can be extended to treat osteoarthritis of any other joint. In addition, the study for this product candidate is being conducted by an investigator, and we do not control that trial as we would if we were conducting the trial ourselves. We currently have no agreement with HSS to develop this product beyond the completion of this study, and there is no assurance that we will reach such an agreement. If we do not do so, there is a risk that the intellectual property of HSS and joint intellectual property developed in the course of our collaboration with HSS or future actions by HSS will interfere with our ability to develop and market an OA implant.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATES\nWe have no history of commercializing drugs, which may make it difficult for you to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future viability.\nOur operations to date have been largely focused on raising capital and developing Retisert, ILUVIEN, Durasert three-year uveitis and our other product candidates, including undertaking pre-clinical studies and\nconducting clinical trials. Bausch & Lomb and Alimera were responsible for completing the clinical development of, obtaining regulatory approval for, and initiating the commercial launch of Retisert and ILUVIEN, respectively under our license agreements with each of them. To date, we have not yet demonstrated our ability to successfully complete clinical development through the submission and attainment of marketing approvals for any product candidate, manufacture at commercial scale, or, with the exception of Retisert and ILUVIEN, arrange for a third party to do so on our behalf, or conduct sales, marketing and distribution activities necessary for successful product commercialization. Consequently, any predictions about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer history of successfully developing and commercializing drugs.\nOur current business strategy relies heavily on our ability to successfully commercialize Durasert three-year uveitis in the United States. Our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve market acceptance or be commercially successful.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize Durasert three-year uveitis, if approved, in the United States is critical to the execution of our business strategy. If approved, Durasert three-year uveitis may not achieve market acceptance among physicians, patients, and third-party payors, and may not be commercially successful in the United States. The degree of market acceptance and commercial success of our products and product candidates, if approved, will depend on a number of factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe acceptance of our products by patients and the medical community and the availability, perceived advantages and relative cost, safety and efficacy of alternative and competing treatments;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain a J-Code for Durasert three-year uveitis and the willingness of third-party payors to reimburse Durasert three-year uveitis based on the J-Code;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our marketing, sales and distribution strategy and operations;\n\u2022\nour ability to manufacture commercial supplies of our products that we manufacture on our own, to remain in good standing with regulatory agencies, and to develop, validate and maintain commercially viable manufacturing processes that are, to the extent required, compliant with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, regulations;\n\u2022\nthe degree to which the approved labeling supports promotional initiatives for commercial success;\n\u2022\nthe availability of reimbursement from managed care plans and other third-party payors and the willingness and ability of patients to pay for our products;\n\u2022\na continued acceptable safety profile of our products and product candidates;\n\u2022\nany new or unexpected results from additional clinical trials or further analysis of clinical data of completed clinical trials by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nour ability to enforce our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nour ability to avoid third-party patent interference or patent infringement claims; and\n\u2022\nmaintaining compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements.\nAs many of these factors are beyond our control, we cannot assure you that we will ever be able to generate meaningful revenues through product sales. Any inability on our part to successfully commercialize Durasert three-year uveitis and our other product candidates in the United States or any foreign territories where they may be approved, or any significant delay in such approvals, could have a material adverse impact on our ability to execute upon our business strategy and our future business prospects.\nIf we are unable to enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell Durasert three-year uveitis, if approved, we may be unable to generate any revenue from Durasert three-year uveitis.\nWe currently have no sales, marketing or distribution capabilities, our approved products are commercialized by others and we have no experience in commercializing products. If Durasert three-year uveitis is approved by the FDA, we intend to commercialize it in the U.S. ourselves through a contract sales organization, or CSO, although we have not yet entered into any agreements with CSOs. Direct commercialization would require us to develop sales and marketing capabilities and to make a significant financial investment. In addition, any CSO that we may use may not dedicate sufficient resources to the commercialization of Durasert three-year uveitis or may otherwise fail in its commercialization due to factors beyond our control. Additionally, any CSO that we may use may fail to comply with applicable legal or regulatory requirements, or may enter into agreements with other parties that have products and services that could compete with Durasert three-year uveitis.\nIn the event that we fail to successfully launch and commercialize Durasert three-year uveitis through a CSO, we may also enter into a strategic collaboration with a third party. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic collaborators, and these strategic collaborations can be intricate and time-consuming to negotiate and document. We may not be able to negotiate strategic collaborations on acceptable terms, or at all. We are unable to predict when, if ever, we will enter into any strategic collaborations because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with establishing strategic partnerships.\nWe do not know if we will decide to directly commercialize any other product candidates ourselves, if approved. If we decide to commercialize a product in one or more countries, there is no assurance we will be able to hire and manage a successful sales and marketing capability or have the financial resources necessary to fund independent commercialization of any products in any country.\nEven if the FDA or other foreign regulatory authority were to grant approval of Durasert three-year uveitis, the terms of the approval may limit its commercial potential.\nEven if we were to successfully obtain approval from the FDA or other foreign regulatory authorities for Durasert three-year uveitis, any such approval might significantly limit the approved indications for use or patient populations, require that black box warnings, contraindications or warnings and precautions be included on the product labeling, require expensive and time-consuming post-approval clinical trials, Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, or surveillance as conditions of approval, or, through product labeling limit the claims that we may make, any of which may impede the successful commercialization of Durasert three-year uveitis. Depending on the extent of any REMS requirements, our costs to commercialize Durasert three-year uveitis may increase significantly and distribution restrictions could limit sales. Further, if the approval of Durasert three-year uveitis contains other significant product label limitations, our ability to address our full target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of Durasert three-year uveitis will be harmed and we may have to limit our sales and marketing efforts.\nEven if we are able to commercialize our product candidates, the products may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, which could harm our business.\nThe regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing and reimbursement for new drug products vary widely from country to country. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a product before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, we might obtain marketing approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay our commercial launch of the product, possibly for lengthy time periods, which could negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that particular country. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in one or more product candidates even if our product candidates obtain marketing approval.\nOur ability to commercialize any products successfully will also depend in part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, determine which medications they will cover and establish reimbursement levels. A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. Third-party payors also may seek additional clinical evidence, beyond the data required to obtain marketing approval, demonstrating clinical benefits and value in specific patient populations, before covering our products for those patients. We cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement will be available for any product that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, what the level of reimbursement will be. Coverage and reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. If reimbursement is not available or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval.\nThere may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Moreover, eligibility for coverage and reimbursement does not imply that any drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacturing, selling and distribution costs. Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may only be temporary. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and profitable reimbursement rates from both government-funded and private payors for any approved products that we develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products, and our overall financial condition.\nIf approved, we intend to ship Durasert three-year uveitis directly to physician offices or clinics to be administered to patients. It will be shipped to physician offices or clinics primarily through specialty pharmacies and distributors and billed to doctors under a \u201cbuy and bill\u201d model. Physicians may find it difficult to meet their payment obligations and our ability to collect payment can be highly uncertain and variable, especially given the relatively high per unit price we expect to charge for each three-year device.\nIf we obtain regulatory approval for Durasert three-year uveitis, our relationships with physicians, patients and payors in the U.S. will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse laws and regulations. Our failure to comply with these laws could expose us to criminal, civil and administrative sanctions, reputational harm, and could harm our results of operations and financial conditions.\nAlthough we have not obtained FDA approval for Durasert three-year uveitis and begun our commercial launch for Durasert three-year uveitis in the United States, our current and future operations with respect to the commercialization of Durasert three-year uveitis will be subject to various U.S. federal and state healthcare laws and regulations. These laws impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing, support and education programs and constrain our business and financial arrangements and relationships with third-party payors, healthcare professionals and others who may prescribe, recommend, purchase or provide Durasert three-year uveitis, and other parties through which we market, sell and distribute Durasert three-year uveitis, if approved. Finally, our current and future operations are subject to additional healthcare-related statutory and regulatory requirements and enforcement by foreign regulatory authorities in jurisdictions in which we conduct our\nbusiness. The laws are described in greater detail in the section above under \u201cBusiness - Government Regulation - Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws,\u201d and include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;\n\u2022\nthe U.S. civil False Claims Act (which can be enforced through \u201cqui tam,\u201d or whistleblower actions, by private citizens on behalf of the federal government), prohibits any person from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment of government funds or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay money to the government or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the U.S. federal government;\n\u2022\nthe U.S. federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, or HIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement, in connection with the delivery of, or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services by a healthcare benefit program, which includes both government and privately funded benefits programs; similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.\n\u2022\nstate laws and regulations, including state anti-kickback and false claims laws, that may apply to our business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including private insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; and state laws and regulations that require drug manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information, which requires tracking gifts and other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities; and\n\u2022\nthe Physician Payments Sunshine Act, implemented as the Open Payments program, and its implementing regulations, requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies that are reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program to report annually to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services information related to certain payments made in the preceding calendar year and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.\nThe shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with different compliance or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare or pharmaceutical company may fail to comply fully with one or more of these requirements. Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations may involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations or guidance. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, additional oversight and reporting requirements if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws and the curtailment or restructuring\nof our operations. If any of the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to the same criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs. Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could harm our financial condition and divert resources and the attention of our management from operating our business.\nAny government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate negative publicity in addition to the aforementioned potential regulatory actions. The occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize Durasert three-year uveitis in the United States, if approved, and generate revenues, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the market opportunities for our product candidates are smaller than we believe they are, our results of operations may be adversely affected and our business may suffer.\nWe focus our research and product development primarily on treatments of back-of-the-eye diseases. Our projections of both the number of people who have these diseases, as well as the subset of people with these diseases who have the potential to benefit from treatment with our product candidates, are based on estimates. These estimates may prove to be incorrect and new studies or clinical trials may change the estimated incidence or prevalence of these diseases. The number of patients in the U.S. and elsewhere may turn out to be lower than expected, may not be otherwise amenable to treatment with our products, or new patients may become increasingly difficult to identify or gain access to, all of which would adversely affect our results of operations and our business.\nIf any of our approved products were to become the subject of problems related to their efficacy, safety, or otherwise, our business would be seriously harmed.\nAll of our approved products will be subject to continual review by the FDA or other foreign regulatory bodies, and we cannot assure you that newly discovered or developed safety issues will not arise. Although we have seen no issues to date, we cannot rule out that issues may arise in the future. With the use of any newly marketed drug by a wider patient population, serious adverse events may occur from time to time that initially do not appear to relate to the drug itself. Any safety issues could cause us or our collaboration partners to suspend or cease marketing of our approved products, cause us or our collaboration partners to modify how we or they market our approved products, subject us to substantial liabilities, and adversely affect our financial condition and business.\nThe Affordable Care Act and any changes in healthcare laws may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize Durasert three-year uveitis in the United States, if approved, and affect the prices we may obtain.\nThe United States has enacted or proposed legislative and regulatory changes affecting the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing of Durasert three-year uveitis in the United States, if approved, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell Durasert three-year uveitis, if approved. The United States government and state legislatures also have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or collectively the Affordable Care Act was intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. These intended reforms are described in greater detail in the section above under \u201cBusiness - Government Regulation - U.S. Healthcare Reform.\u201d\nAmong the provisions of the Affordable Care Act that have been implemented since enactment and are of importance to the commercialization of Durasert three-year uveitis in the United States, if approved, are the following:\n\u2022\nan annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs or biologic agents;\n\u2022\nan increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program;\n\u2022\nexpansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the U.S. civil False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;\n\u2022\na new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for a manufacturer\u2019s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;\n\u2022\nextension of manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;\n\u2022\na new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected;\n\u2022\nexpansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs;\n\u2022\nexpansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;\n\u2022\nrequirements to report certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals;\n\u2022\na requirement to annually report certain information regarding drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians; and\n\u2022\na new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.\nLegislative changes to or regulatory changes under the Affordable Care Act remain possible in the 115th U.S. Congress and under the Trump Administration. The American Health Care Act of 2017, or AHCA, which would repeal and replace key portions of the Affordable Care Act was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives but remains subject to passage by the U.S. Senate. In addition, in January 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the Affordable Care Act to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the Affordable Care Act that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. We expect that the Affordable Care Act, as currently enacted or as it may be amended in the future, and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to maintain or increase sales of Durasert three-year uveitis in the United States, if approved, or to successfully commercialize Durasert three-year uveitis in the United States, if approved.\nWe expect that the Affordable Care Act, as well as other healthcare reform measures that have and may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for Durasert three-year uveitis in the United States, if approved, and could seriously harm our future revenues. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid, or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenues, attain profitability or commercialize Durasert three-year uveitis in the United States.\nIf competitive products receive regulatory approval or reach the market earlier, are more effective, have fewer side effects, are more effectively marketed or cost less than our products or product candidates, our products or product candidates may not be approved, may not achieve the sales we anticipate and could be rendered noncompetitive or obsolete.\nWe believe that pharmaceutical, drug delivery and biotechnology companies, research organizations, governmental entities, universities, hospitals, other nonprofit organizations and individual scientists are seeking to develop drugs, therapies, products, approaches or methods to treat our targeted diseases or their underlying causes. For our targeted diseases, competitors have alternate therapies that are already commercialized or are in various stages of development, ranging from discovery to advanced clinical trials. Any of these drugs, therapies, products, approaches or methods may receive government approval or gain market acceptance more rapidly than our products and product candidates, may offer therapeutic or cost advantages, or may more effectively treat our targeted diseases or their underlying causes, which could result in our product candidates not being approved, reduce demand for our products and product candidates or render them noncompetitive or obsolete.\nMany of our competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technological, research and development, marketing and personnel resources than we do. Our competitors may succeed in developing alternate technologies and products that, in comparison to the products we have and are seeking to develop:\n\u2022\nare more effective and easier to use;\n\u2022\nare more economical;\n\u2022\nhave fewer side effects;\n\u2022\noffer other benefits; or\n\u2022\nmay otherwise render our products less competitive or obsolete.\nMany of these competitors have greater experience in developing products, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals or clearances and manufacturing and marketing products than we do.\nOur products and product candidates may not achieve and maintain market acceptance and may never generate significant revenues.\nIn both domestic and foreign markets, the commercial success of our products and product candidates will require not only obtaining regulatory approvals, but also obtaining market acceptance by retinal specialists and other doctors, patients, government health administration authorities and other third-party payors. Whether and to what extent our products and product candidates achieve and maintain market acceptance will depend on a number of factors, including demonstrated safety and efficacy, cost-effectiveness, potential advantages over other therapies, our and our collaborative partners\u2019 marketing and distribution efforts and the reimbursement policies and determinations of government and other third-party payors. In particular, if governments, private insurers, governmental insurers and other third-party payors do not recommend our products and product candidates, limit the indications for which they are recommended, do not provide adequate and timely coverage and reimbursement levels for our products or limit the frequency of administration, the market acceptance of our products and product candidates will be limited. Governments, governmental insurers, private insurers and other third-party payors attempt to contain healthcare costs by limiting coverage and the level of reimbursement for products and, accordingly, they may challenge the price and cost-effectiveness of our products, or refuse to provide coverage for our products. If our products and product candidates fail to achieve and maintain market acceptance, they may fail to generate significant revenues and our business may be significantly harmed.\nGuidelines, recommendations and studies published by various organizations could reduce the use of our products and potential use of product candidates.\nGovernment agencies, professional societies, practice management groups, private health and science foundations and organizations focused on various diseases may publish guidelines, recommendations or studies\nthat affect our or our competitors\u2019 products and product candidates. Any such guidelines, recommendations or studies that reflect negatively on our products or product candidates, either directly or relative to our competitive products, could result in current or potential decreased use, sales of, and revenues from one or more of our products and product candidates. Furthermore, our success depends in part on our and our partners\u2019 ability to educate healthcare providers and patients about our products and product candidates, and these education efforts could be rendered ineffective by, among other things, third-parties\u2019 guidelines, recommendations or studies.\nThe micro-insert for ILUVIEN and Durasert three-year uveitis delivers FA, a corticosteroid that is associated with certain adverse side effects in the eye, which may affect the success of this micro-insert for treatment of DME and posterior segment uveitis.\nThe micro-insert for both ILUVIEN and Durasert three-year uveitis delivers the non-proprietary corticosteroid FA, which is associated with cataract formation and elevated IOP and may increase the risk of glaucoma and related surgery to manage those side effects. These side effects shown in the Phase 3 trials for ILUVIEN resulted in limitations to the approved indications of ILUVIEN, and sales of ILUVIEN may be adversely affected by the potential side effects from FA relative to other treatments for DME. The extent of ILUVIEN\u2019s long-term side-effect profile beyond month 36 is not yet known. Alimera is conducting a five-year post-authorization, open label registry study of the safety of ILUVIEN in 800 patients treated with the European labeled indication, which was a condition of European approval. In July 2017, Alimera announced that the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) gave final approval for Alimera to cap total enrollment at 550 patients, with the last three-year patient follow-up visit anticipated in January 2020. Data from this study or other commercial experience could result in the withdrawal of ILUVIEN\u2019s marketing approval in one or more jurisdictions. Further, delay in the commercial launch of ILUVIEN could result in the withdrawal of marketing or regulatory authorization for ILUVIEN in jurisdictions where ILUVIEN has already received marketing authorization. In addition, the perception by physicians of this benefit of efficacy versus the side-effect profile could adversely affect sales of ILUVIEN.\nDurasert three-year uveitis achieved encouraging safety results through the last follow-up visit in each of its two Phase 3 trials. However, there is no assurance that encouraging safety results will continue in these trials. There is also no assurance that the overall risk-benefit profile for Durasert three-year uveitis will be favorable or that it will be determined to be safe for the treatment of posterior segment uveitis in light of potential side effects from FA. These side effects may limit the population for which marketing authorization is granted or for which reimbursement is provided in one or more jurisdictions and/or adversely affect sales of Durasert three-year uveitis, if approved. In addition, because the micro-insert for ILUVIEN and Durasert three-year uveitis are substantially the same, any safety issues that arise with respect to ILUVIEN could impact Durasert three-year uveitis, which could result in delays in the approval process, prevent the FDA from approving Durasert three-year uveitis and, even if approved, cause us to suspend marketing of Durasert three-year uveitis or subject us to substantial liability, which would adversely affect our financial condition and business.\nIf the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities approve generic products with claims that compete with any of our product candidates, it could reduce our sales of those product candidates.\nIn the United States, after an NDA is approved, the product covered thereby becomes a \u201clisted drug\u201d which can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FD&C Act, FDA regulations and other applicable regulations and policies provide incentives to manufacturers to create modified, non-infringing versions of a drug to facilitate the approval of an ANDA or other application for generic substitutes. These manufacturers might only be required to conduct a relatively inexpensive study to show that their product has the same active ingredients, dosage form, strength, route of administration, and conditions of use, or product labeling, as our product candidate and that the generic product is absorbed in the body at the same rate and to the same extent as, or is bioequivalent to, our product candidate. These generic equivalents would be significantly less costly than ours to bring to market and companies that produce generic equivalents are generally able to offer their products at lower prices. Thus, after the introduction of a generic\ncompetitor, a significant percentage of the sales of any branded product are typically lost to the generic product. Accordingly, competition from generic equivalents to our product candidates would substantially limit our ability to generate revenues and therefore to obtain a return on the investments we have made in our product candidates.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights or if our intellectual property rights are inadequate to protect our product candidates, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar to ours, and our competitive position could be harmed.\nOur commercial success will depend in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and products. We rely on trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws, and confidentiality and other agreements with employees and third parties, all of which offer only limited protection. We seek patent protection for many different aspects of our product candidates, including their compositions, their methods of use, processes for their manufacture, and any other aspects that we deem to be commercially important to the development of our business.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we and any licensors and licensees may not be able to apply for or prosecute patents on certain aspects of our product candidates or delivery technologies at a reasonable cost, in a timely fashion, or at all. For technology licensed to third parties, we may not have the right to control the preparation, filing and/or prosecution of the corresponding patent applications, or to maintain patent rights corresponding to such technology. Therefore, these patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. It is also possible that we or any licensors or licensees, will fail to identify patentable aspects of inventions made in the course of development and commercialization activities before it is too late to obtain patent protection on them. It is possible that defects of form in the preparation or filing of our patents or patent applications may exist, or may arise in the future, such as with respect to proper priority claims, inventorship, claim scope or patent term adjustments. If any licensors or licensees, are not fully cooperative or disagree with us as to the prosecution, maintenance, or enforcement of any patent rights, such patent rights could be compromised and we might not be able to prevent third parties from making, using, and selling competing products. If there are material defects in the form or preparation of our patents or patent applications, such patents or applications may be invalid or unenforceable. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods, and know-how. Any of these outcomes could impair our ability to prevent competition from third parties, which may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nThe patent positions of pharmaceutical companies generally are highly uncertain, involve complex legal and factual questions and have in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of any patents that issue, are highly uncertain. For example, recent changes to the patent laws of the United States provide additional procedures for third parties to challenge the validity of issued patents. Under the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA), which was signed into law on September 16, 2011, patents issued from applications with an effective filing date after March 15, 2013 may be challenged by third parties using the post-grant review procedure which allows challenges for a number of reasons, including prior art, sufficiency of disclosure, and subject matter eligibility. Under the AIA, patents may also be challenged under the inter partes review procedure. Inter partes review provides a mechanism by which any third party may challenge the validity of any issued U.S. Patent in the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) on the basis of prior art. Because of a lower evidentiary standard necessary to invalidate a patent claim in USPTO proceedings as compared to the evidentiary standard relied on in U.S. federal court, a third party could potentially provide evidence in a USPTO proceeding sufficient for the USPTO to hold a claim invalid even though the same evidence would be insufficient to invalidate the claim if first presented in a district court action. Accordingly, a third party may attempt to use the USPTO procedures to invalidate our patent claims that would not have been invalidated if first challenged by the third party as a defendant in a district court action.\nWith respect to foreign jurisdictions, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States or vice versa. For example, European patent law restricts the patentability of methods of treatment of the human body more than United States law does. Also, patents granted by the European Patent Office may be opposed by any person within nine months from the publication of their grant.\nOur patents and patent applications, even if unchallenged by a third party, may not adequately protect our intellectual property or prevent others from designing around our claims. The steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to preclude misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights, both inside and outside the United States. Further, the examination process may require us to narrow the claims of pending patent applications, which may limit the scope of patent protection that may be obtained if these applications issue. The rights that may be granted under future issued patents may not provide us with the proprietary protection or competitive advantages we are seeking. If we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and products, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficient, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or superior to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be impaired.\nAs of August 31, 2017, we had 137 patents and 75 pending patent applications, including patents and pending applications covering our Durasert, Tethadur and other technologies. With respect to these patent rights, we do not know whether any of our patent applications will result in issued patents or, if any of our patent applications do issue, whether such patents will protect our technology in whole or in part, or whether such patents will effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. There is no guarantee that any of our issued or granted patents will not later be found invalid or unenforceable. Furthermore, since patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing, we cannot be certain that we were the first to either (i) file any patent application related to our product candidates or (ii) invent any of the inventions claimed in our patents or patent applications. For applications with an effective filing date before March 16, 2013, or patents issuing from such applications, an interference proceeding can be provoked by a third party, or instituted by the USPTO to determine who was the first to invent any of the subject matter covered by the patent claims of our applications and patents. As of March 16, 2013, the United States transitioned to a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system for deciding which party should be granted a patent when two or more patent applications are filed by different parties claiming the same invention. A third party that files a patent application in the USPTO before us could therefore be awarded a patent covering an invention of ours even if we had made the invention before it was made by the third party. This will require us to be cognizant going forward of the time from invention to filing of a patent application. The change to \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d from \u201cfirst-to-invent\u201d is one of the changes to the patent laws of the United States resulting from the AIA.\nPublications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing or in some cases not at all, until they are issued as a patent. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our pending patent applications, that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions, or that we have found all of the potentially relevant prior art relating to our patents and patent applications that could invalidate one or more of our patents or prevent one or more of our patent applications from issuing. Even if patents do successfully issue and even if such patents cover our product candidates, third parties may initiate oppositions, interferences, re-examinations, post-grant reviews, inter partes reviews, nullification or derivation actions in court or before patent offices or similar proceedings challenging the validity, enforceability, or scope of such patents, which may result in the patent claims being narrowed or invalidated. Furthermore, even if they are unchallenged, our patents and patent applications may not adequately protect our intellectual property, provide exclusivity for our product candidates, or prevent others from designing around our claims. Any of these outcomes could impair our ability to prevent competition from third parties.\nFurthermore, the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our owned and licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or freedom to operate or in patent claims being narrowed,\ninvalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such product candidates might expire before or shortly after such product candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or the patents of any party from whom we may license patents from in the future. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In a patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, for example, lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability during patent litigation is unpredictable. A court may decide that a patent of ours or of any of our future licensors is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. In addition, to the extent that we have to file patent litigation in a federal court against a U.S. patent holder, we would be required to initiate the proceeding in the state of incorporation or residency of such entity. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that no invalidating prior art exists. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, found unenforceable, or interpreted narrowly, and it could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on one or more of our products. Such a loss of patent protection could compromise our ability to pursue our business strategy.\nAs noted above, interference proceedings brought by the USPTO for applications with an effective filing date before March 16, 2013, or for patents issuing from such applications may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents and patent applications or those of our collaborators or licensors. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if a prevailing party does not offer us a license on terms that are acceptable to us. Litigation or interference proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distraction of our management and other employees. We may not be able to prevent, alone or with any of our future licensors, misappropriation of our proprietary rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nMoreover, we may be subject to a third-party pre-issuance submission of prior art to the USPTO or other foreign patent offices, or become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could invalidate or reduce the scope of, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or drugs and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize drugs without infringing\nthird-party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop, or commercialize current or future product candidates.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on our product candidates throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States may be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws and practices of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights, especially those relating to life sciences, to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. For example, novel formulations of drugs and manufacturing processes may not be patentable in certain jurisdictions, and the requirements for patentability may differ in certain countries, particularly developing countries. Also, some foreign countries, including European Union countries, India, Japan and China, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled under certain circumstances to grant licenses to third parties. Consequently, we may have limited remedies if patents are infringed or if we are compelled to grant a license to a third party, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions into or within the United States or other jurisdictions. This could limit our potential revenue opportunities. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products, and may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but where enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products in jurisdictions where we do not have any issued patents and our patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing with us in these jurisdictions. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from our intellectual property. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate in these foreign countries and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents and applications are required to be paid to the USPTO and various governmental patent agencies outside of the United States in several stages over the lifetime of the patents and applications. The USPTO and various non-U.S. governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process and after a patent has issued. There are situations in which non-compliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which could be uncertain and could harm our business.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates, if approved, and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. While many of our product candidates are in pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, we believe that the use of our product candidates in these pre-clinical studies and clinical trials falls within the scope of the exemptions provided by 35 U.S.C. Section 271(e) in the United States, which exempts from patent infringement liability activities reasonably related to the development and submission of information to the FDA. As our other product candidates progress toward commercialization, the possibility of a patent infringement claim against us increases. Accordingly, we may invest significant time and expense in the development of our product candidates only to be subject to significant delay and expensive and time-consuming patent litigation before our product\ncandidates may be commercialized. There can be no assurance that our product candidates do not infringe other parties\u2019 patents or other proprietary rights, and competitors or other parties may assert that we infringe their proprietary rights in any event.\nThere is considerable intellectual property litigation in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. We may become party to, or threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our product candidates, including interference or derivation proceedings before the USPTO. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications owned by third parties exist in the fields in which we are developing our product candidates. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future.\nIf we are found to infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue commercializing our product candidates. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if a license can be obtained on acceptable terms, the rights may be non-exclusive, which could give our competitors access to the same technology or intellectual property rights licensed to us. If we fail to obtain a required license, we may be unable to effectively market product candidates based on our technology, which could limit our ability to generate revenues or achieve profitability and possibly prevent us from generating revenues sufficient to sustain our operations. Alternatively, we may need to redesign our infringing products, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. Under certain circumstances, we could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing our product candidates. In addition, in any such proceeding or litigation, we could be found liable for substantial monetary damages, potentially including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could harm our business. Any claims by third parties that we have misappropriated their confidential information or trade secrets could have a similar negative impact on our business.\nThe cost to us in defending or initiating any litigation or other proceeding relating to patent or other proprietary rights, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial, and litigation would divert our management\u2019s attention. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could compromise our commercialization efforts, delay our research and development efforts and limit our ability to continue our operations. There could also be public announcements of the results of the hearing, motions, or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive those results to be negative, it could cause the price of shares of our common stock to decline.\nOur competitors may be able to circumvent our patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner.\nOur competitors may seek approval to market their own products that are the same as, similar to or otherwise competitive with our product candidates. In these circumstances, we may need to defend or assert our patents by various means, including filing lawsuits alleging patent infringement requiring us to engage in complex, lengthy and costly litigation or other proceedings. In any of these types of proceedings, a court or government agency with jurisdiction may find our patents invalid, unenforceable or not infringed. We may also fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Even if we have valid and enforceable patents, these patents still may not provide protection against competing products or processes sufficient to achieve our business objectives.\nChanges in either U.S. or foreign patent law or interpretation of such laws could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products.\nAs is the case with other pharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the pharmaceutical industry involve both\ntechnological and legal complexity, and it therefore is costly, time-consuming and inherently uncertain. As noted above, the AIA has significantly changed U.S. patent law. In addition to transitioning from a \u201cfirst-to-invent\u201d to \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system, the AIA also limits where a patentee may file a patent infringement suit and provides opportunities for third parties to challenge issued patents in the USPTO via post-grant review or inter partes review, for example. All of our U.S. patents, even those issued before March 16, 2013, may be challenged by a third party seeking to institute inter partes review.\nDepending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, the USPTO, or similar authorities in foreign jurisdictions, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future.\nWe may be subject to claims asserting that our employees, consultants, independent contractors and advisors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information and/or alleged trade secrets of their current or former employers or claims asserting ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nAlthough we try to ensure that our employees, consultants, independent contractors and advisors do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that these individuals or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed confidential information and/or intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of the companies that any such individual currently or formerly worked for or provided services to. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to our business.\nIn addition, while we require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the conception or development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who, in fact, conceives or develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. The assignment of intellectual property rights may not be self-executing or the assignment agreements may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims that they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property.\nIntellectual property rights do not prevent all potential threats to competitive advantages we may have.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and intellectual property rights may not adequately protect our business or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage.\nThe following examples are illustrative:\n\u2022\nothers may be able to make drug and device components that are the same as or similar to our product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or have exclusively licensed;\n\u2022\nwe or any of our licensors or collaborators might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the issued patent or pending patent application that we own or have exclusively licensed;\n\u2022\nwe or any of our licensors or collaborators might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our inventions;\n\u2022\nothers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nthe prosecution of our pending patent applications may not result in granted patents;\n\u2022\ngranted patents that we own or have licensed may not cover our products or may be held not infringed, invalid or unenforceable, as a result of legal challenges by our competitors;\n\u2022\nwith respect to granted patents that we own or have licensed, especially patents that we either acquire or in-license, if certain information was withheld from or misrepresented to the patent examiner, such patents might be held to be unenforceable;\n\u2022\npatent protection on our product candidates may expire before we are able to develop and commercialize the product, or before we are able to recover our investment in the product;\n\u2022\nour competitors might conduct research and development activities in the United States and other countries that provide a safe harbor from patent infringement claims for such activities, as well as in countries in which we do not have patent rights, and may then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in markets where we intend to market our product candidates;\n\u2022\nwe may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;\n\u2022\nthe patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business; and\n\u2022\nwe may choose not to file a patent application for certain technologies, trade secrets or know-how, and a third party may subsequently file a patent covering such intellectual property.\nShould any of these events occur, they could significantly harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking patent protection for certain aspects of our product candidates and technologies, we also consider trade secrets, including confidential and unpatented know-how important to the maintenance of our competitive position. We protect trade secrets and confidential and unpatented know-how, in part, by customarily entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to such knowledge, such as our employees, outside scientific and commercial collaborators, CROs, CMOs, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants that obligate them to maintain confidentiality and assign their inventions to us. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known, including through a potential cybersecurity breach, or may be independently developed by competitors.\nEnforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.\nIf our trademarks are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our business may be adversely affected.\nWe expect to rely on trademarks as one means to distinguish any of our product candidates that are approved for marketing from the products of our competitors. We have received Notices of Allowance for UVIEY\u2122, YUTIQ\u2122 and DELIVERING INNOVATION TO THE EYE\u2122, and our Durasert\u2122 mark has been published in the United States. Retisert\u00ae and Vitrasert\u00ae are Bausch & Lomb\u2019s trademarks. ILUVIEN\u00ae is Alimera\u2019s trademark. Our and our licensees\u2019 trademarks may be challenged, infringed, circumvented or declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks. For instance, Sun Pharma has filed an extension of time to\nfile an opposition to our trademark application for Durasert. We are currently negotiating a co-existence agreement with Sun Pharma. If we are unable to reach an agreement and our Durasert trademark is successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our Durasert technology, which could result in loss of brand recognition and could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing a new brand. In addition, we may not be able to protect our or our licensees\u2019 rights to these trademarks or may be forced to stop using these names, which we need for name recognition by potential partners or customers in our markets of interest. If we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks, we may not be able to compete effectively.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR RELIANCE ON THIRD PARTIES\nWe do not control the development or commercialization of Durasert three-year uveitis for posterior segment uveitis in the EMEA, which is licensed to Alimera, and as a result we may not realize the full market potential of Durasert three-year uveitis.\nUnder the Amended Alimera Agreement, we granted Alimera rights to Durasert three-year uveitis in the EMEA (under the ILUVIEN trademark) and subsequently withdrew our Durasert three-year uveitis MAA and orphan drug designation for posterior segment uveitis. Alimera is now responsible for obtaining all regulatory approvals in the EMEA. Under this agreement, we have no control over Alimera\u2019s regulatory activities in the EMEA (with the exception of the completion of our ongoing Phase 3 uveitis clinical trials), including regulatory approvals, and no direct control over commercialization efforts for Durasert three-year uveitis in the EMEA. Alimera has only limited experience in filing and supporting the applications necessary to obtain marketing approvals for product candidates. Obtaining approval of an MAA by the EMA is uncertain and Alimera may fail to obtain the approval. The MAA review processes, and the processes of other regulatory authorities, are extensive, lengthy, expensive, and uncertain, and such regulatory authorities may delay, limit, or deny approval of Durasert three-year uveitis for posterior segment uveitis. Further, Alimera may abandon further development of Durasert three-year uveitis in the EMEA. Because the full market potential of Durasert three-year uveitis is contingent upon the successful development and commercialization of Durasert three-year uveitis in the EMEA, we will be dependent on Alimera to achieve the full market potential of Durasert three-year uveitis. If Alimera does not succeed in obtaining regulatory approval of Durasert three-year uveitis in the EMEA for any reason, or does not succeed in securing market acceptance of Durasert three-year uveitis in the EMEA, or elects for any reason to discontinue development of Durasert three-year uveitis, we will be unable to realize the full market potential of Durasert three-year uveitis.\nIf our CROs, vendors and investigators do not successfully carry out their responsibilities or if we lose our relationships with them, our development efforts with respect to our product candidates could be delayed.\nWe are dependent on CROs, vendors and investigators for pre-clinical testing and clinical trials related to our product development programs. These parties are not our employees, and we cannot control the amount or timing of resources that they devote to our programs. If they do not timely fulfill their responsibilities or if their performance is inadequate, the development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed. The parties with which we contract for execution of clinical trials play a significant role in the conduct of the trials and the subsequent collection and analysis of data. Their failure to meet their obligations could adversely affect clinical development of our product candidates. In addition, if we or our CROs fail to comply with applicable cGCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving any marketing applications. Upon inspection, the FDA may determine that our clinical trials did not comply with cGCPs.\nSwitching or adding additional CROs involves additional cost and requires management time and focus. Identifying, qualifying and managing performance of third-party service providers can be difficult, time-consuming and cause delays in our development programs. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO commences work and the new CRO may not provide the same type or level of services as the original provider. Though we carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse\nimpact on our business, financial condition and prospects. If any of our relationships with our CROs terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or to do so on commercially reasonable terms. As a result, delays may occur, which can materially impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines.\nBecause we have relied on third parties, our internal capacity to perform these functions is limited. Outsourcing these functions involves risks that third parties may not perform to our standards, may not produce results in a timely manner or may fail to perform at all. In addition, the use of third-party service providers requires us to disclose our proprietary information to these parties, which could increase the risk that this information will be misappropriated. We currently have a small number of employees, which limits the internal resources we have available to identify and monitor our third-party providers. To the extent we are unable to identify and successfully manage the performance of third-party service providers in the future, our ability to advance our product candidates through clinical trials will be compromised. Though we carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter similar challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nThe success of our current and possible future collaborative and licensing arrangements depends and will depend heavily on the experience, resources, efforts and activities of our licensees, and if they are not successful in developing and marketing our products, it will adversely affect our revenues, if any, from those products.\nOur business strategy includes continuing to leverage our technology platform by entering into collaborative and licensing arrangements for the development and commercialization of our product candidates, where appropriate. The success of current and future collaborative and licensing arrangements do and will depend heavily on the experience, resources, skill, efforts and activities of our licensees. Our licensees have had, and are expected to have, significant discretion in making decisions related to the development of product candidates and the commercialization of products under these collaboration agreements. Risks that we face in connection with our collaboration and licensing strategy include the following:\n\u2022\nour collaborative and licensing arrangements are, and are expected to be, subject to termination under various circumstances, including on short notice and without cause;\n\u2022\nwe are required, and expect to be required, under our collaborative and licensing arrangements, not to conduct specified types of research and development in the field that is the subject of the arrangement or not to sell products in such field, limiting the areas of research, development and commercialization that we can pursue;\n\u2022\nour licensees may develop and commercialize, either alone or with others, products that are similar to or competitive with our products;\n\u2022\nour licensees may change the focus of their development and commercialization efforts or decrease or fail to increase spending related to our products or product candidates, thereby limiting the ability of these products to reach their potential;\n\u2022\nour licensees may lack the funding, personnel or experience to develop and commercialize our products successfully or may otherwise fail to do so; and\n\u2022\nour licensees may not perform their obligations, in whole or in part.\nWe currently have collaboration and licensing arrangements with various companies, most significantly Alimera and Bausch & Lomb. While Bausch & Lomb has significant experience in the ophthalmic field and substantial resources, there is no assurance whether, and to what extent, that experience and those resources will be devoted to Retisert, and we do not expect revenues from Retisert to increase, and they may decline further. Although we believe potential revenues from ILUVIEN are important to our future results of operations and financial condition, Alimera has limited experience and limited financial resources, and ILUVIEN for DME is currently Alimera\u2019s first and only commercial product. Alimera has reported that its negative cash flows from\noperations and accumulated deficit may raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Further, due to the limited revenue generated by Alimera to date, Alimera may not be able to maintain compliance with covenants under its loan agreement and, in the event of a default, we do not know whether Alimera will be able to obtain amendments or waivers of those covenants. We do not know if Alimera will be able to raise additional financing if and when required.\nIf our current and future licensees are not successful in developing and marketing our products, it will adversely affect our revenues, if any, from those products.\nOur current licensees may terminate their agreements with us at any time or fail to fulfill their obligations under those agreements, and, if they do, we will lose the benefits of those agreements.\nOur licensees have rights of termination under our agreements with them and could terminate those agreements without cause on short notice. Further, our licensees may fail to fulfill their obligations under their agreements, or we may disagree with them over the rights and obligations under those agreements, which could result in breach of the agreements and/or termination. Exercise of termination rights by one or more of our licensees or by us may leave us without the financial benefits and development, marketing or sales resources provided under the terminated agreement. It could be necessary for us to replace, or seek to provide ourselves, the services provided by the licensee, and there is no assurance we would be successful in doing so. It could delay, impair or stop the development or commercialization of products or product candidates licensed to them or require significant additional capital investment by us, which we may not have the resources to fund. If any of our licensees do not perform their obligations under our agreements or if any of those agreements are terminated, it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOff-label sales of ILUVIEN to treat posterior segment uveitis may adversely affect sales of Durasert three-year uveitis, if approved.\nThe micro-inserts that comprise ILUVIEN and Durasert three-year uveitis have substantially the same design, polymers and release rate, and both deliver the corticosteroid FA. Although Durasert three-year uveitis delivers a somewhat lower dose of FA than ILUVIEN, ILUVIEN is already approved and marketed. It is possible that physicians will prescribe ILUVIEN for the treatment of posterior segment uveitis on an off-label basis, which could adversely affect the sales of Durasert three-year uveitis, if approved.\nThere is no assurance that Alimera will successfully commercialize ILUVIEN for DME or that we will receive significant revenues from the commercialization of ILUVIEN.\nWe are entitled to royalties on a country-by-country and quarter-by-quarter basis on net sales of ILUVIEN where Alimera markets ILUVIEN directly and to a percentage of product revenues, royalties and non-royalty consideration where Alimera sublicenses the marketing of ILUVIEN. The commercialization of ILUVIEN for DME is a significant undertaking by Alimera, and ILUVIEN for DME is Alimera\u2019s first and only commercial product. Alimera\u2019s sales of ILUVIEN have not been significant to date, Alimera has continued to incur operating losses, and it has violated and in the future may violate the financial covenants of its loan agreement. We do not know if, when, or to what extent Alimera\u2019s ILUVIEN net revenues will increase significantly, which would generate royalties to us from the commercialization of ILUVIEN for DME. The amount and timing of any revenues we receive will be affected by many factors including:\n\u2022\nAlimera\u2019s and its distributors\u2019 and sublicensees\u2019 ability to effectively market and sell ILUVIEN in each country where sold;\n\u2022\nthe manner of sale, whether directly by Alimera or by sublicensees or distributors, and the terms of sublicensing and distribution agreements;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of sales of ILUVIEN in each country;\n\u2022\nregulatory approvals, appropriate labeling, and desirable pricing, insurance coverage and reimbursement;\n\u2022\ncompetition;\n\u2022\ncommencement of marketing in additional countries; and\n\u2022\nAlimera\u2019s ability to raise adequate capital as needed to fund its operations, to maintain compliance with its loan agreement and to achieve profitability from its operations.\nIf Alimera is not successful in commercializing ILUVIEN for DME, it would adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nAlimera may need alternative financing to replace its $35.0 million debt facility or additional capital to maintain compliance with the financial covenants under its loan agreement, which Alimera may be unable to obtain, and Alimera\u2019s continued losses and financial condition may cast doubt on its ability to continue to operate as a going concern.\nAlthough Alimera launched ILUVIEN for DME in Germany and the U.K. in the second quarter of 2013 and in the U.S. and Portugal in the first quarter of 2015, Alimera had accumulated a deficit of $386.6 million through June 30, 2017. Alimera has not generated revenues that cover its actual or anticipated expenses and cannot project the extent of its future losses. Alimera may continue to incur operating losses, and as a result, it is uncertain when or if it will achieve or sustain profitability. Alimera\u2019s ability to generate royalty payments to us is dependent on its ability to successfully market and sell ILUVIEN for DME.\nAlimera failed to meet a revenue threshold in January 2016 and a liquidity threshold as of June 30, 2016 under the financial covenants of its loan agreement. While these failures were subsequently waived by the lender, Alimera was required to pay substantial amounts and grant concessions in connection with these waivers. In addition, through June 30, 2017, we believe that Alimera\u2019s ILUVIEN net sales were not sufficient to allow them to draw down an additional $5 million under their existing loan facility. Alimera has an at-the-market facility in place for possible sales of its common stock. If Alimera is not successful in raising the capital it requires, and defaults on its obligations under its loan agreement, its lender may call the loan, which could require Alimera to pay back the entire amount owed and pay an early termination fee, or if the lender does not call the loan, Alimera may have to pay an increased rate of interest, pay additional monetary amounts in exchange for a waiver or modification of the loan agreement, or grant additional equity or warrant coverage and agree to further restrictions on its operations that could hinder it in the future. Alimera\u2019s failure to comply with the covenants under the loan agreement could create substantial doubt about Alimera\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern and to market and sell ILUVIEN. The termination provisions of our agreement with Alimera include various bankruptcy events.\nFurther, due to the limited revenue generated by ILUVIEN to date, even if Alimera is able to refinance its loan agreement and maintain compliance with its covenants, Alimera may need to raise additional capital to fund the continued commercialization of ILUVIEN. If Alimera is unable to raise sufficient additional financing, it may need to adjust its commercial plans, which likely would adversely affect Alimera\u2019s ability to market ILUVIEN and make any potential royalty payments to us.\nSales of ILUVIEN for DME may be materially adversely affected by pricing and reimbursement decisions of regulatory bodies, insurers and others.\nPrices, coverage and reimbursement to consumers of ILUVIEN for DME, like other drugs, are generally regulated by third-party payors, such as government health administration authorities and plans, private health insurers and other organizations and affect ILUVIEN\u2019s sales. The timing and complexity of those reimbursements also affect sales. Prices in the EU are generally lower and coverage and access to drugs more limited than in the U.S. For example, in the U.K. and Scotland, National Health Service coverage is limited to the\ntreatment of the eyes of chronic DME patients unresponsive to existing therapies that have undergone cataract surgery, subject to simple patient access schemes. Alimera may not achieve satisfactory agreements with statutory or other insurers. We do not know what levels of pricing will be approved or reimbursed for ILUVIEN, or what restrictions will be placed on its use or reuse in countries where ILUVIEN is not currently sold. In the U.S., Alimera has offered extended customer payment terms. Future net sales of ILUVIEN and, accordingly, the amount of royalties that we may receive from such net sales, may be adversely affected by pricing and reimbursement decisions, and such effects may be material.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS, INDUSTRY, STRATEGY AND OPERATIONS\nIf we fail to retain key personnel, our business could suffer.\nWe are dependent upon the principal members of our management and scientific staff. In addition, we believe that our future success in developing and marketing our products will depend on whether we can attract and retain additional qualified management and scientific personnel as well as a sales and marketing staff. There is strong competition for qualified personnel within the industry in which we operate, and we may not be able to attract and retain such personnel. As we have a small number of employees and we believe our products are unique and highly specialized, the loss of the services of one or more of the principal members of our management or scientific staff, or the inability to attract and retain additional personnel and develop expertise as needed, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe will need to grow the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth.\nImplementation of our development and commercialization strategies will require additional managerial, operational, sales, marketing, financial and other resources. Our current management, personnel and systems may not be adequate to effectively manage the expansion of our operations, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, give rise to operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, employee turnover and reduced productivity. Future growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of our existing or future product candidates. Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including:\n\u2022\nmanaging the commercialization of any approved product candidates;\n\u2022\noverseeing our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials effectively;\n\u2022\nidentifying, recruiting, maintaining, motivating and integrating additional employees, including any sales and marketing personnel engaged in connection with the commercialization of any approved product;\n\u2022\nengaging and managing our relationship with any contract sales organizations; and\n\u2022\nmanaging our internal development efforts effectively while complying with our contractual obligations to licensors, licensees, contractors and other third parties; and improving our managerial, development, operational and financial systems and procedures.\nAs our operations expand, we will need to manage additional relationships with various strategic collaborators, suppliers and other third parties. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our product candidates and to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth effectively. To that end, we must be able to manage our development efforts and clinical trials effectively and hire, train and integrate additional management, administrative and sales and marketing personnel. Failure to accomplish any of these activities could prevent us from successfully growing our company.\nIf we are subject to product liability suits, we may not have sufficient insurance to cover damages.\nThe testing, manufacturing, marketing and sale of the products utilizing our technologies involve risks that product liability claims may be asserted against us and/or our licensees. Our current clinical trial and product\nliability insurance may not be adequate to cover damages resulting from product liability claims. Regardless of their merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims could require us to spend significant time, money and other resources to defend such claims, could result in decreased demand for our products and product candidates, or result in reputational harm, and could result in the payment of a significant damage award. Our product liability insurance coverage is subject to deductibles and coverage limitations and may not be adequate in scope to protect us in the event of a successful product liability claim. Further, we may not be able to acquire sufficient clinical trial or product liability insurance in the future on reasonable commercial terms, if at all.\nConsolidation in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may adversely affect us.\nThere has been consolidation in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Consolidation could result in the remaining companies having greater financial resources and technological capabilities, thus intensifying competition, and fewer potential collaboration partners or licensees for our product candidates. In addition, if a consolidating company is already doing business with any of our competitors, we could lose existing or potential future licensees or collaboration partners as a result of such consolidation.\nIf we or our licensees fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations, our or their ability to manufacture and commercialize products may be adversely affected.\nMedical and biopharmaceutical research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous materials, such as radioactive compounds and chemical solvents. We and our licensees are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of such materials and waste products. We and they could be subject to both criminal liability and civil damages in the event of an improper or unauthorized release of, or exposure of individuals to, hazardous materials. In addition, claimants may sue us or them for resulting injury or contamination, and the liability may exceed our or their ability to pay. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair the research, development or production efforts of our company or our licensees and harm our operating results.\nIf we or our licensees encounter problems with product manufacturing, there could be delays in product development or commercialization, which would adversely affect our future profitability.\nOur ability and that of our licensees to conduct timely pre-clinical and clinical research and development programs, obtain regulatory approvals, and develop and commercialize our product candidates will depend, in part, upon our and our licensees\u2019 ability to manufacture our products and product candidates, either directly or through third parties, in accordance with FDA and other regulatory requirements. The manufacture, packaging and testing of our products and product candidates are regulated by the FDA and similar foreign regulatory entities and must be conducted in accordance with applicable cGMP and comparable foreign requirements. Any change in a manufacturing process or procedure used for one of our products or product candidates, including a change in the location at which a product or product candidate is being manufactured or in the third-party manufacturer being used, may require the FDA\u2019s and similar foreign regulatory entities\u2019 prior review and/or approval in accordance with applicable cGMP or other regulations. Additionally, the FDA and similar foreign regulatory entities may implement new standards, or change their interpretation and enforcement of existing standards, for the manufacture, packaging and testing of products at any time.\nThere are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under cGMP and other foreign regulations that are both capable of manufacturing our products and product candidates and are willing to do so. Alimera has contracted with individual third-party manufacturers for the manufacture of ILUVIEN and its components. If any of Alimera\u2019s third-party manufacturers breach their agreements or are unable or unwilling to perform for any reason or fail to comply with cGMP and comparable foreign requirements, Alimera may not be able to locate alternative acceptable manufacturers, enter into favorable agreements with them or get them approved by the applicable regulatory authorities in a timely manner. Delays in the commercial production of ILUVIEN could\ndelay or impair Alimera\u2019s marketing of ILUVIEN, which, in turn, could adversely affect Alimera\u2019s generation of sales-based royalties to us. Failure by us, our collaborative partners, or our or their third-party manufacturers, to comply with applicable manufacturing requirements could result in sanctions being imposed on us or our collaborative partners, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of our product candidates, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of product, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions. If we or our collaborative partners are unable to develop our own manufacturing facilities or to obtain or retain third-party manufacturing on acceptable terms, we may not be able to conduct certain future pre-clinical and clinical testing of our product candidates and our collaborative partners may not be able to conduct certain future pre-clinical and clinical testing or to supply commercial quantities of our products. We manufacture supplies in connection with pre-clinical or clinical studies conducted by us and our licensees. Our licensees have the exclusive rights to manufacture commercial quantities of products, once approved for marketing. Our licensees\u2019 reliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks, including:\n\u2022\nfailure of third parties to comply with cGMP and other applicable U.S. and foreign regulations and to employ adequate quality assurance practices;\n\u2022\ninability to obtain the materials necessary to produce a product or to formulate the active pharmaceutical ingredient on commercially reasonable terms, if at all;\n\u2022\nsupply disruption, deterioration in product quality or breach of a manufacturing or license agreement by the third party because of factors beyond our or our licensees\u2019 control;\n\u2022\ntermination or non-renewal of a manufacturing or licensing agreement with a third party at a time that is costly or difficult; and\n\u2022\ninability to identify or qualify an alternative manufacturer in a timely manner, even if contractually permitted to do so.\nWe intend to use our own facility for the manufacturing of Durasert three-year uveitis, which will require significant resources, which could adversely affect its commercial viability.\nIf approved by the FDA, we plan to manufacture commercial supplies of Durasert three-year uveitis ourselves at our Watertown facility. We currently manufacture products only for clinical and testing purposes in this facility and we do not manufacture products for commercial use. We must obtain FDA approval of our manufacturing process before we can commercially manufacture Durasert three-year uveitis in the United States. In addition, we must pass a pre-approval inspection of our manufacturing facility before we can obtain marketing approval for Durasert three-year uveitis. In order to obtain approval, all of our manufacturing methods, equipment and processes must comply with the FDA\u2019s cGMP requirements. We will also need to perform extensive audits of our suppliers, vendors and contract laboratories. The cGMP requirements govern all areas of recordkeeping, production processes and controls, personnel and quality control. To ensure that we meet these requirements, we will expend significant time, money and effort. Due to the unique nature of our Durasert technology platform, we cannot predict the likelihood that the FDA will approve our facility as compliant with cGMP requirements even if we believe that we have taken the steps necessary to achieve compliance.\nThe FDA, in its regulatory discretion, may require us to undergo additional clinical trials with respect to any new or improved manufacturing process we develop or utilize, in the future, if any. This could delay or prevent approval of Durasert three-year uveitis or any of our other product candidates. If we fail to comply with cGMP requirements, pass an FDA pre-approval inspection or obtain FDA approval of our manufacturing process, we would not receive FDA approval and would be subject to possible regulatory action, including recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing. The failure to successfully implement our manufacturing process may delay or prevent our ability to commercialize Durasert three-year uveitis.\nIf we do obtain FDA approval for Durasert three-year uveitis, including satisfying the FDA with regard to a validated manufacturing process, we may still be unable to commercially manufacture Durasert three-year\nuveitis. The commercial manufacture of medical products is complex and requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. Manufacturers of medical products often encounter difficulties in production, particularly in scaling out and validating initial production and ensuring the absence of contamination. These problems include difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control, including stability of the product, quality assurance testing, operator error, shortages of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with strictly enforced federal, state and foreign regulations. We cannot assure you that any stability or other issues relating to the manufacture of Durasert three-year uveitis, if approved, will not occur in the future.\nThe FDA also may, at any time following approval of a product for sale, audit our manufacturing facilities. If any such inspection or audit identifies a failure to comply with applicable regulations or if a violation of our product specifications or applicable regulation occurs independent of such an inspection or audit, we or the FDA may require remedial measures that may be costly and/or time consuming for us to implement and that may include the temporary or permanent suspension of commercial sales, recalls, market withdrawals, seizures or the temporary or permanent closure of a facility. Any such remedial measures imposed upon us could materially harm our business.\nEconomic conditions and regulatory changes leading up to and following the U.K.\u2019s likely exit from the EU could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn June 2016, the U.K. held a non-binding referendum in which voters approved an exit from the EU (commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d), the announcement of which caused significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Pound Sterling currency in which we conduct certain business activity. As a result of the referendum, it is expected that the U.K. government will begin negotiating the terms of the U.K.\u2019s withdrawal from the EU, which may amplify the adverse effects experienced to date.\nGiven the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade and legal implications the withdrawal of the U.K. from the EU may have and how such withdrawal may affect us. The announcement of Brexit and the withdrawal of the U.K. from the EU may create economic uncertainty, which may reduce sales of our licensed products. A U.K. withdrawal from the EU may, among other things, increase regulatory complexities, disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people between the U.K. and the EU, undermine bilateral cooperation in key policy areas and significantly disrupt trade between the U.K. and the EU. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations in Europe, as the U.K. determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. It raises uncertainty, for example, as to the regulatory path for marketing approval of ILUVIEN for posterior uveitis in the U.K.\nIf the U.K. were to significantly alter its laws or regulations affecting the biotechnology or pharmaceutical industries, we could face significant new costs and uncertainties. Altered regulations could add time and expense to the process by which our product candidates receive regulatory approval in the U.K. and the EU. Similarly, it is unclear at this time what impact Brexit will have on our intellectual property rights and the process for obtaining and defending such rights.\nOur employees, collaborators, service providers, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, CSOs, vendors and CROs may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees, collaborators, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, CSOs, vendors and CROs may engage in fraudulent or other illegal activity with respect to our business. Misconduct by these employees could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or unauthorized activity that violates:\n\u2022\nFDA regulations, including those laws requiring the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to the FDA;\n\u2022\nmanufacturing standards;\n\u2022\nfederal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations; or\n\u2022\nlaws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data.\nIn particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Misconduct by these parties could also involve individually identifiable information, including, without limitation, the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, or illegal misappropriation of drug product, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. Any incidents or any other conduct that leads to an employee receiving an FDA debarment could result in a loss of business from third parties and severe reputational harm.\nAlthough we have adopted a Code of Conduct to govern and deter such behaviors, it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and curtailment of our operations.\nThe security of our information technology systems may be compromised, and confidential information, including non-public personal information that we maintain, could be improperly disclosed.\nOur information technology systems may be vulnerable to physical or electronic intrusions, computer viruses or other attacks. As part of our business, we and our vendors maintain large amounts of confidential information, including non-public personal information on patients and our employees. Breaches in security could result in the loss or misuse of this information, which could, in turn, result in potential regulatory actions or litigation, including material claims for damages, interruption to our operations, damage to our reputation or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. We expect to have appropriate information security policies and systems in place in order to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information, including non-public personal information, there can be no assurance that such use or disclosure will not occur.\nIf we fail to comply with data protection laws and regulations, we could be subject to government enforcement actions, which could include civil or criminal penalties, as well as private litigation and/or adverse publicity, any of which could negatively affect our operating results and business.\nWe may be subject to laws and regulations that address privacy and data security of patients who use our product candidates in the United States and in states in which we conduct our business. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act) govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. For instance, HIPAA imposes certain obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information and imposes notification obligations in the event of a breach of the privacy or security of individually identifiable health information on entities subject to HIPAA and their business associates that perform certain activities that\ninvolve the use or disclosure of protected health information on their behalf. Certain of these laws and regulations are described in greater detail in the section above under \u201cBusiness - Government Regulation - Healthcare Privacy Laws.\u201d Failure to comply with applicable data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions and create liability for us, which could include civil and/or criminal penalties, as well as private litigation and/or adverse publicity that could negatively affect our operating results and business.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of computer system failures, cyberattacks or a deficiency in our cybersecurity.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of our contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures, cyberattacks or cyber-intrusions over the Internet, attachments to emails, persons inside our organization, or persons with access to systems inside our organization. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments, and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. Such an event could cause interruption of our operations. For example, the loss of data from completed or ongoing clinical trials for our product candidates could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to our data, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur material legal claims and liability and damage to our reputation and the development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed.\nWe may be exposed to liabilities under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other U.S. and foreign anti-corruption anti-money laundering, export control, sanctions, and other trade laws and regulations, and any determination that we violated these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to export control and import laws and regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, U.S. Customs regulations, and various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control. We are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or FCPA, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, the U.S. Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act 2010, the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, and possibly other anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in countries outside of the United States in which we conduct our activities. Anti-corruption laws are interpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees and third-party intermediaries from authorizing, promising, offering, providing, soliciting, or accepting, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to or from any person whether in the public or private sector. As we commercialize Durasert three-year uveitis and any of other product candidates that we may develop, we may engage with third-party manufacturers and collaborators who operate abroad and are required to obtain certain necessary permits, licenses and other regulatory approvals with respect to our business. Our activities abroad create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors, even though they may not always be subject to our control. It is our policy to implement safeguards to discourage these practices by our employees, consultants, sales agents and distributors. However, our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective, and the employees, consultants, sales agents, or distributors of our company may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities.\nNoncompliance with anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, export control, sanctions, and other trade laws could subject us to whistleblower complaints, investigations, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, other enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, significant fines, damages, other civil and criminal penalties or injunctions, suspension and/or debarment from contracting with certain persons, the loss of export privileges, reputational harm, adverse media coverage and other collateral consequences. If any subpoenas or investigations\nare launched, or governmental or other sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially harmed. Responding to any action will likely result in a materially significant diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and significant defense and compliance costs and other professional fees. In addition, the U.S. government may seek to hold us liable for successor liability FCPA violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire. As a general matter, enforcement actions and sanctions could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nRISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK\nThe trading price of the shares of our common stock has been highly volatile, and purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses.\nThe price of our common stock (including common stock represented by CHESS Depositary Interests (\u201cCDIs\u201d)) is highly volatile and may be affected by developments directly affecting our business, as well as by developments out of our control or not specific to us. The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, in particular, and the stock market generally, are vulnerable to abrupt changes in investor sentiment. Prices of securities and trading volumes of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including ours, can swing dramatically in ways unrelated to, or that bear a disproportionate relationship to, our performance. The price of our common stock (and CDIs) and their trading volumes may fluctuate based on a number of factors including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nclinical trials and their results, and other product and technological developments and innovations;\n\u2022\nFDA and other domestic and international governmental regulatory actions, receipt and timing of approvals of our product candidates, and any denials and withdrawal of approvals;\n\u2022\ncompetitive factors, including the commercialization of new products in our markets by our competitors;\n\u2022\nadvancements with respect to treatment of the diseases targeted by our product candidates;\n\u2022\ndevelopments relating to, and actions by, our collaborative partners, including execution, amendment and termination of agreements, achievement of milestones and receipt of payments;\n\u2022\nthe success of our collaborative partners in marketing any approved products and the amount and timing of payments to us;\n\u2022\navailability and cost of capital and our financial and operating results;\n\u2022\nactions with respect to pricing, reimbursement and coverage, and changes in reimbursement policies or other practices relating to our products or the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries generally;\n\u2022\nmeeting, exceeding or failing to meet analysts\u2019 or investors\u2019 expectations, and changes in evaluations and recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\neconomic, industry and market conditions, changes or trends; and\n\u2022\nother factors unrelated to us or the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries.\nIn addition, low trading volume in our common stock or our CDIs may increase their price volatility. Holders of our common stock and CDIs may not be able to liquidate their positions at the desired time or price. Finally, we will need to continue to meet the listing requirements of NASDAQ, including the minimum stock price, and ASX, for our stock and CDIs to continue to be traded on those exchanges, respectively.\nAdditional shares that may be issued upon the exercise of currently outstanding options or upon the settlement of restricted or performance stock units would dilute the voting power of our currently outstanding common stock and could cause our stock price to decline.\nAs of August 31, 2017, we had outstanding options to acquire approximately 6.9 million shares of our common stock, outstanding restricted stock units to acquire 948,500 shares of our common stock and outstanding performance stock units to acquire 210,000 shares of our common stock, or approximately 17.0% of our shares on a fully diluted basis. The issuance of shares of our common stock upon exercise of the stock options or settlement of the restricted or performance stock units could result in dilution to the interests of other holders of our common stock and could adversely affect our stock price.\nFuture sales of our common stock may depress our stock price.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or as a result of the perception that these sales could occur, which could occur if we issue a large number of shares of common stock (or securities convertible into our common stock) in connection with a future financing, as our common stock is trading at low levels. These factors could make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of common stock or other equity securities.\nProvisions in our charter documents could prevent or delay stockholders\u2019 attempts takeover our company.\nOur board of directors is authorized to issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, with designations, rights and preferences as they may determine. Accordingly, our board of directors may in the future, without stockholder approval, issue shares of preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock. This type of preferred stock could also be issued to discourage, delay or prevent a change in our control. The ability to issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock is a traditional anti-takeover measure. This provision in our charter documents makes it difficult for a majority stockholder to gain control of our company. Provisions like this may be beneficial to our management and our board of directors in a hostile tender offer and may have an adverse impact on stockholders who may want to participate in such a tender offer.\nProvisions in our bylaws provide for indemnification of officers and directors, which could require us to direct funds away from our business and the development of our product candidates.\nOur bylaws provide for the indemnification of our officers and directors. We may in the future be required to advance costs incurred by an officer or director and to pay judgments, fines and expenses incurred by an officer or director, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, as a result of actions or proceedings in which our officers and directors are involved by reason of being or having been an officer or director of our company. Funds paid in satisfaction of judgments, fines and expenses may be funds we need for the operation of our business and the development of our product candidates, thereby affecting our ability to attain profitability.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock, and any return to investors is expected to come, if at all, only from potential increases in the price of our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock, and you should not rely on an investment in our common stock to provide dividend income. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. In addition, the terms of any future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nWe may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert our management\u2019s attention.\nAs we operate in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, we may be especially vulnerable to volatility in the market price of our common stock, especially to the extent that various factors affect the\ncommon stock of companies in our industry. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business, and could also require us to make substantial payments to satisfy judgments or to settle litigation.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.", "PERMNO": 90542, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "EYPT"}
