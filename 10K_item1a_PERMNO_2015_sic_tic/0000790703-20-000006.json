{"cik": "790703", "company": "TECH DATA CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-25", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe following are certain risk factors that could affect our business, financial position and results of operations. These risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because these factors could cause the actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Before you buy our common stock or other securities, you should know that making such an investment involves risks, including the risks described below. The risks that have been highlighted below are not the only risks of our business. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected. In that case, the trading price of our common stock or other securities could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements are as follows:\nOur ability to earn profit is more challenging when sales slow from a down economy as a result of gross profit declining faster than cost reduction efforts taking effect.\nAdverse economic conditions may result in lower demand for the products and services we sell. When we experience a rapid decline in demand for products we experience more difficulty in achieving the gross profit and operating profit we desire due to the lower sales and increased pricing pressure. The economic environment may also result in changes in vendor terms and conditions, such as rebates, cash discounts and cooperative marketing efforts, which may also result in downward pressure on our gross profit. As a result, there is pressure to reduce the cost of operations in order to maximize operating profits. To the extent we cannot reduce costs to offset such decline in gross profits, our operating profits typically deteriorate. The benefits from cost reductions may also take longer to fully realize and may not fully mitigate the impact of the reduced demand or changes in vendor terms and conditions. Should we experience a decline in operating profits or not achieve the planned level of growth in operations of previously acquired companies, the valuations we develop for purposes of our goodwill impairment test may be adversely affected, potentially resulting in impairment charges. Deterioration in the financial and credit markets heightens the risk of customer bankruptcies and delays in payment. Future deterioration in the credit markets could result in reduced availability of credit insurance to cover customer accounts. This, in turn, may result in our reducing the credit lines we provide to customers, thereby having a negative impact on our net sales, gross profits and net income.\nOur competitors can take more market share by reducing prices on vendor products that contribute the most to our profitability.\nThe technology distribution industry is characterized by intense competition, based primarily on product availability, credit terms and availability, price, effectiveness of information systems and e-commerce tools, speed of delivery, ability to tailor specific solutions to customer needs, quality and depth of product lines and training, service and support. Our customers are not required to purchase any specific volume of products from us and may move business if pricing is reduced by competitors, resulting in lower sales. As a result, we must be extremely flexible in determining when to reduce prices to maintain market share and sales volumes and when to allow our sales volumes to decline to maintain the quality of our profitability. We compete with a variety of regional, national and international wholesale distributors, some of which may have greater financial resources than us.\nWe are dependent on internal information and telecommunications systems, and any failure of these systems, including system security breaches, data protection breaches or other cybersecurity attacks, may negatively impact our business and results of operations.\nCyber-attacks and other tactics designed to gain access to and exploit sensitive information by breaching mission critical systems of large organizations are constantly evolving and have been increasing in sophistication in recent years. High profile security breaches leading to unauthorized release of sensitive information have occurred with increasing frequency at a number of major U.S. companies, despite widespread recognition of the cyber-attack threat and improved data protection methods. In addition, regulations related to data protection, including the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) which took effect in May 2018, create a range of new compliance obligations for the Company. While to date we have not experienced a significant data loss, significant compromise or any material financial losses related to cybersecurity attacks, our systems, those of our customers, and those of our third-party service providers are under constant threat. Cybercrime, including phishing, social engineering, attempts to overload our servers with denial-of-service attacks, or similar disruptions from unauthorized access to our systems, could cause us critical data loss or the disclosure or use of personal or other confidential information. Outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees to disclose personally identifiable information or other confidential information which could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information.\nWe are dependent on internal information and telecommunications systems, and we are vulnerable to failure of these systems, including through system security breaches, data protection breaches or other cybersecurity attacks. If these events occur, the unauthorized disclosure, loss or unavailability of data and disruption to our business may have a material adverse effect on our reputation and harm our relationships with vendors and customers. Additionally, these events may lead to financial losses from remedial actions, or potential liability from fines, including in relation to noncompliance with the GDPR, as well as possible litigation and punitive damages. Failures of our internal information or telecommunications systems may prevent us from taking customer orders, shipping products and billing customers. Sales may also be impacted if our customers are unable to access our pricing and product availability information. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to ship products if our third party shipping companies cease operations temporarily or permanently.\nWe rely on arrangements with independent shipping companies for the delivery of our products from vendors and to customers. The failure or inability of these shipping companies to deliver products or the unavailability of their shipping services, even temporarily, may have an adverse effect on our business and our operating results.\nIf our vendors do not continue to provide price protection for inventory we purchase from them, our profit from the sale of that inventory may decline.\nIt is very typical in our industry that the value of inventory will decline as a result of price reductions by vendors or technological obsolescence. It is the policy of many of our vendors to protect distributors from the loss in value of inventory due to technological change or the vendors' price reductions. Some vendors, however, may be unwilling or unable to pay us for price protection claims or products returned to them under purchase agreements. Moreover, industry practices are sometimes not embodied in written agreements and do not protect us in all cases from declines in inventory value. No assurance can be given that such practices to protect distributors will continue, that unforeseen new product developments will not adversely affect us or that we will be able to successfully manage our existing and future inventories.\nFailure to obtain adequate product supplies from our largest vendors, or terminations of a supply or services agreement, or a significant change in vendor terms or conditions of sale by our largest vendors may negatively affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nA significant percentage of our revenues are from products we purchase from certain vendors, such as Apple, Inc., HP Inc. and Cisco Systems, Inc. These vendors have significant negotiating power over us and rapid, significant or adverse changes in sales terms and conditions, such as reducing the amount of price protection and return rights as well as reducing the level of purchase discounts and rebates they make available to us, may reduce the profit we can earn on these vendors' products and result in loss of revenue and profitability. Our gross profit could be negatively impacted if we are unable to pass through the impact of these changes to our customers or cannot develop systems to manage ongoing vendor programs. Additionally, significant changes in vendor payment terms or payment arrangements could negatively impact our liquidity and financial condition. Our standard vendor distribution agreement permits termination without cause by either party upon 30 days notice. The loss of a relationship with any of our key vendors, a change in their strategy (such as increasing direct sales), the merger or reorganization of significant vendors or significant changes in terms on their products may adversely affect our business.\nWe conduct business in countries outside of the U.S., which exposes us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that result in losses in certain periods.\nApproximately 60%, 61% and 62% of our net sales in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 were generated in countries outside of the U.S., which exposes us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We may enter into short-term forward exchange or option contracts to hedge this risk. Nevertheless, volatile foreign currency exchange rates increase our risk of loss related to products purchased in a currency other than the currency in which those products are sold. While we maintain policies to protect against fluctuations in currency exchange rates, extreme fluctuations have resulted in our incurring losses in some countries. Furthermore, our local competitors in certain markets may have different purchasing models that provide them reduced foreign currency exposure compared to us. This may result in market pricing that we cannot meet without significantly lower profit on sales. In addition, we may be exposed to foreign exchange risk that may occur as a result of the United Kingdom's (\u201cU.K.\u201d) withdrawal from the European Union, commonly referred to as \"Brexit\". Brexit may adversely affect global economic and market conditions and could contribute to volatility in the foreign exchange markets, which we may be unable to effectively manage through our foreign exchange risk management program.\nThe translation of the financial statements of foreign operations into U.S. dollars is also impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which may positively or negatively impact our results of operations. In addition, the value of our equity investment in foreign countries may fluctuate based upon changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These fluctuations, which are recorded in a cumulative translation adjustment account, may result in losses in the event a foreign subsidiary is sold or closed at a time when the foreign currency is weaker than when we made investments in the country. The realization of any or all of these risks could have a significant adverse effect on our financial results.\nNatural disasters, public health crises and other catastrophic events or other events outside of our control may negatively impact our business and results of operations.\nIf any of our facilities or the facilities of our suppliers, service providers, or customers, is affected by public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics; political crises, such as terrorism, war, political instability or other conflict; or other events outside of our control, our business, operating results and reputation could suffer. Moreover, these types of events could negatively impact the availability of products from our suppliers, consumer and business spending in the impacted regions or globally, which could adversely impact our operating results.\nFor example, in March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) a pandemic. The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative effect on the global economy, disrupting the financial markets and creating increasing volatility, and impeded global supply chains, including our own. Our suppliers are experiencing delays in the production and export of their products, and we have experienced impacts to our freight and logistic operations, including increased costs. Additionally, we may need to close logistics centers for a period of time as a result of government mandates or self-imposed health and safety initiatives. While we have initiated short-term measures to address delays in our supply chain, including\nadvance purchases, such measures may not be sufficient to fully mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and such steps may negatively impact our financial condition. We cannot at this time accurately predict what effects these conditions will have on our operations, including due to uncertainties relating to the ultimate geographic spread of the virus, the severity and duration of the pandemic, the effect on our customers and customer demand and the length of the restrictions and closures imposed by various governments; however, we expect to see a negative impact to our revenue and earnings from the COVID-19 pandemic in the first quarter, which may continue into the second quarter or beyond.\nIn addition, certain of our facilities, including our corporate headquarters in Clearwater, Florida, are located in geographic areas that heighten our exposure to hurricanes, tropical storms and other severe weather events. Future weather events could cause severe damage to our property and technology and could cause major disruptions to our operations. We carry property damage and business interruption insurance; however, there can be no assurance that such insurance would be adequate to cover any losses we may incur. As such, a hurricane, tropical storm or severe weather event may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have international operations which expose us to risks associated with conducting business in multiple jurisdictions.\nOur international operations are subject to other risks such as the imposition of governmental controls, export license requirements, restrictions on the export of certain technology, political instability, trade restrictions, tariff changes, uncertainty surrounding the implementation and effects of Brexit, difficulties in staffing and managing international operations, changes in the interpretation and enforcement of laws (in particular related to items such as duty and taxation), difficulties in collecting accounts receivable, longer collection periods, the impact of local economic conditions and practices, uncertainties arising from local business practices and cultural considerations, and enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or similar laws of other jurisdictions.\nThe U.S. government has imposed tariffs on certain products imported into the U.S. and the Chinese government has imposed tariffs on certain products imported into China, which have increased the prices of many of the products that the Company purchases from its suppliers. The new tariffs, along with any additional tariffs or trade restrictions that may be implemented by the U.S. or other countries, could result in further increased prices. While the Company intends to pass price increases on to our customers, the effect of tariffs on prices may impact sales and results of operations. There can be no assurance that these and other factors will not have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with the impact of trade discussions between the U.S. and China and related U.S. security risks and export controls. On May 15, 2019, the President of the United States issued an Executive Order that authorized export controls on Chinese entities determined to be a U.S. security threat. At the same time, the U.S. Commerce Dept. placed certain Chinese companies and their subsidiaries on the U.S. Entity List requiring U.S. companies to obtain export licensing approval before providing certain technology. We hold inventory of products impacted by the recent government action and there is uncertainty relating to the disposition of this inventory due to restrictions that would prevent purchasers from updating software on the products in the future. While we continue to take steps to mitigate our exposure to this developing situation, if the sale of these products is delayed or we are unable to return or dispose of our inventory on favorable economic terms, we may incur additional carrying costs for the inventory or otherwise record losses associated with the inventory.\nChanges in tax laws or tax rulings in the jurisdictions in which we operate may materially impact our financial position and results of operations. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has been working on the Base Erosion and Profit Sharing Project, and has issued and will continue to issue, guidelines and proposals that may change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business. Certain countries are evaluating their tax policies and regulations, which could affect international business and may have an adverse effect on our overall tax rate, along with increasing the complexity, burden and cost of tax compliance. For example, on December 22, 2017, the U.S. federal government enacted the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cU.S. Tax Reform\u201d) which significantly revised U.S. corporate income tax law by, among other things, reducing the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and implementing a modified territorial tax system that includes a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Additional changes in the U.S. tax regime or in how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings, including changes in how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, while our labor force in the U.S. is currently non-union, employees of certain other subsidiaries are subject to collective bargaining or similar arrangements. We do business in certain foreign countries where labor disruption is more common than is experienced in the U.S. and some of the freight carriers we use are unionized. A labor strike by a group of our employees, one of our freight carriers, one of our vendors, a general strike by civil service employees or a governmental shutdown could have an adverse effect on our business. Many of the products we sell are manufactured in countries other than the countries in which our logistics centers are located. The inability to receive products into the logistics centers because of government action or labor disputes at critical ports of entry may have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe have incurred substantial indebtedness that may impact our financial position and subject us to financial and operating restrictions, decrease our access to capital, and / or increase our borrowing costs, which may adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nOur business requires substantial capital to operate and to finance accounts receivable and product inventory that are not financed by trade creditors. We have historically relied upon cash generated from operations, bank credit lines, trade credit from vendors, accounts receivable purchase agreements, proceeds from public offerings of our common stock and proceeds from debt offerings to satisfy our capital needs and to finance growth. The incurrence of debt under our Senior Notes and other credit facilities subject us to financial and operating covenants, which may limit our ability to borrow and our flexibility in responding to our business needs.\nAs of January 31, 2020, we had approximately $1.5 billion of total debt. If we are not able to maintain compliance with stated financial covenants or if we breach other covenants in any debt agreement, we could be in default under such agreement. Such a default may allow our creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross acceleration or cross-default provision applies. Our overall leverage and terms of our financing could, among other things:\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or for general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult to satisfy our obligations under the terms of our debt;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us or at all;\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult to obtain trade credit from vendors;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility to plan for and adjust to changing business and market conditions and repurchase shares of our common stock; and\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions.\nChanges in our credit rating or other market factors may increase our interest expense or other costs of capital.\nCertain of our financing instruments involve variable rate debt, thus exposing us to the risk of fluctuations in interest rates. In addition, the interest rate payable on the 3.70% Senior Notes and the 4.95% Senior Notes (each as defined herein) and certain other credit facilities would be subject to adjustment from time to time if our credit rating is downgraded. The U.K.\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve has begun publishing a Secured Overnight Funding Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d), which is intended to replace U.S. dollar LIBOR. Plans for alternative reference rates for other currencies have also been announced. At this time, we cannot predict how markets will respond to these proposed alternative rates or the effect of any changes to LIBOR or the discontinuation of LIBOR. If LIBOR is no longer available or if our lenders have increased costs due to changes in LIBOR, we may experience potential increases in interest rates on our variable rate debt, which could adversely impact our interest expense, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe cannot predict what losses we might incur in litigation matters, regulatory enforcement actions and contingencies that we may be involved with from time to time.\nWe cannot predict what losses we might incur from litigation matters, regulatory enforcement actions and contingencies that we may be involved with from time to time. There are various other claims, lawsuits and pending actions against us. From time to time, we are involved in various legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands and investigations relating to our business, which may include claims with respect to antitrust, mergers and acquisitions and other matters. In the ordinary course of business, we also receive inquiries from and have discussions with government entities regarding the compliance of our contracting and sales practices with laws and regulations. These matters can be time-consuming, divert management\u2019s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. Allegations made in the course of regulatory or legal proceedings may also harm our reputation, regardless of whether there is merit to such claims. Furthermore, because litigation and the outcome of regulatory proceedings are inherently unpredictable, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these proceedings, claims, demands or investigations. We do not expect that the ultimate resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. However, the resolution of certain of these matters could be material to our operating results for any particular period. We can make no assurances that we will ultimately be successful in our defense of any of these matters.\nRisks Related to the Merger\nThe Merger is subject to various closing conditions and other risks which may cause the Merger to be delayed or not completed at all or have other adverse consequences.\nThe Merger is subject to various closing conditions that must be satisfied or waived to complete the Merger. There can be no assurance that these conditions will be satisfied or waived or that the Merger will be completed in a timely manner or at all. Failure to satisfy or obtain waivers of any closing condition may jeopardize or delay the completion of the Merger and result in additional expenditures of money and resources (including the potential payment of termination fees and other costs). In addition, the Merger is contingent upon the receipt of certain regulatory clearances or approvals. There can be no assurance that the conditions to closing will be satisfied or waived or that other events will not intervene to delay or prevent the closing of the Merger. If the Merger is not completed for any reason, the price of our Common Stock may decline to the extent that the current market price reflects an assumption that the Merger will be consummated. Furthermore, if the Merger is not completed for any reason, our ongoing business and financial results would be subject to a number of risks, including negative reactions from analysts, media and financial markets, negative reactions from customers or employees, distraction of management attention, and litigation related to the Merger or the Company\u2019s failure to perform its obligations under the Merger Agreement.\nLegal proceedings instituted against the Company and others relating to the Merger Agreement also could delay or prevent the Merger from becoming effective within the agreed upon timeframe. In addition, we may elect to terminate the Merger Agreement in certain circumstances, and the parties can mutually decide to terminate the Merger Agreement at any time prior to the consummation of the Merger. Further, uncertainty among our employees about their future roles after the completion of the Merger may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel, and the pendency of the Merger may disrupt our business relationships with our existing and\npotential customers, suppliers, vendors, landlords, and other business partners, who may attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than us. The adverse consequence of the pendency of the Merger could be exacerbated by any delays in completion of the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement.\nWhile the Merger Agreement is in effect, we are subject to restrictions on our business activities.\nWhile the Merger Agreement is in effect, we are subject to restrictions on the business activities we may engage in without the prior written consent of an affiliate of the Apollo Funds, including, among other things, restrictions on our ability to acquire other businesses and assets, dispose of our assets, make investments, enter into certain contracts, repurchase or issue securities, pay dividends, make capital expenditures, amend our organizational documents, incur indebtedness and settle litigation. These restrictions could prevent us from pursuing strategic business opportunities, taking actions with respect to our business that we may consider advantageous and responding effectively and/or timely to competitive pressures and industry developments, which may as a result materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 10182, "SIC": 5045, "TIC": "TECD"}
