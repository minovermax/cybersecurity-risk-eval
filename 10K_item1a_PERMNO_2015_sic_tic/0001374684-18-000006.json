{"cik": "1374684", "company": "MULESOFT, INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-02-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risks, together with all of the other information contained in our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making a decision to invest in our Class A common stock. Any of the following risks could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects, and could cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to decline, which would cause you to lose all or part of your investment. Our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe have a history of losses, and as our costs increase, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to achieve and sustain profitability.\nWe have incurred net losses in each period since our inception, including net losses of $80.0 million, $49.6 million, and $65.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. As a result, we had an accumulated deficit of $316.2 million as of December 31, 2017. We expect our operating expenses to increase significantly as we increase our sales and marketing efforts, continue to invest heavily in research and development, and expand our operations and infrastructure, both domestically and internationally. In addition, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant additional legal, accounting, and other expenses related to being a public company. While our revenue has grown in recent years, if our revenue declines or fails to grow at a rate faster than these increases in our operating expenses, we will not be able to achieve and maintain profitability in future periods. As a result, we may continue to generate losses. We cannot assure you that we will achieve profitability in the future or that, if we do become profitable, we will be able to sustain profitability.\nWe have experienced rapid growth in recent periods. If we fail to continue to grow and to manage our growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan, increase our revenue, improve our results of operations, maintain high levels of service, or adequately address competitive challenges.\nWe have recently experienced a period of rapid growth in our business, operations, and employee headcount. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, our revenue was $296.5 million, $187.7 million, and $110.3 million, respectively, representing a 58% and 70% growth rate. We have also significantly increased the size of our customer base from 1,071 and 839 customers as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, to over 1,200 customers as of December 31, 2017. We grew from 841 and 603 employees as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, to 1,188 employees as of December 31, 2017. We expect to continue to expand our operations and employee headcount in the near term. Our success will depend in part on our ability to continue to grow and to manage this growth effectively.\nOur recent growth has placed, and future growth will continue to place, a significant strain on our management, administrative, operational, and financial infrastructure. We will need to continue to improve our operational, financial, and management controls, and our reporting systems and procedures to manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel, which will require significant capital expenditures and allocation of valuable management and employee resources. If we fail to implement these infrastructure improvements effectively, our ability to ensure uninterrupted operation of key business systems and comply with the rules and regulations that are applicable to public reporting companies will be impaired. Further, if we do not effectively manage the growth of our business and operations, the quality of our platform and services could suffer, and we may not be able to adequately address competitive challenges. This could impair our ability to attract new customers, retain existing customers and expand their use of our platform, all of which would adversely affect our brand, overall business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe currently derive substantially all of our revenue and cash flows from Anypoint Platform, and any failure of this platform to satisfy customer demands or to achieve increased market acceptance would adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and growth prospects.\nWe derive substantially all of our revenue and cash flows from subscriptions for, and services related to, Anypoint Platform. Demand for Anypoint Platform is affected by a number of factors beyond our control, including increased market acceptance of our platform by existing customers and potential new customers, the extension of our platform for use cases, the timing of development and release of new products by our competitors and additional capabilities and functionality by us, technological change, and growth or contraction of the market in which we compete. In addition, we cannot assure you that our platform and future enhancements to our platform will be able to address future advances in technology or requirements of existing customers or potential new customers. For example, our platform may not be able to be used to build application networks that can scale with the massive proliferation of applications, data and devices that reside on-premises and in the cloud. If we are unable to continue to meet customer demands or to achieve more widespread market acceptance of our platform, our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects will be adversely affected.\nWe began selling Anypoint Platform in 2014. Due to our limited experience selling the platform, it may be difficult to forecast our future results of operations and subjects us to a number of uncertainties, including the pace and degree of customer adoption of our platform. We have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies operating in new or developing markets. If our assumptions regarding these uncertainties, which we use to plan our business, are incorrect or change in reaction to changes in our markets, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our results of operations and financial condition could differ materially from our expectations and our business could suffer.\nThe market for application networks and our platform is new and unproven.\nWe introduced Anypoint Platform in 2014 to address the developing need to connect applications, data, and devices within and between the organization and its external ecosystems. While we believe that, over time, the concept of an application network will become fundamental to an organization\u2019s core operations, the market for application networks is largely unproven and is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u2022\norganizations may determine that they only need point-to-point products to address their software integration needs;\n\u2022\norganizations may decide that the investments needed to construct an application network are too significant or that such investments are better spent on other strategic initiatives within the organization; and\n\u2022\norganizations may not understand the benefits that can be achieved with an application network.\nMoreover, even if the market for application networks develops, we may not be able to differentiate the benefits of Anypoint Platform from other products that may be developed to address the demand for application networks. Our ability to successfully market and sell Anypoint Platform will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to support our customers as they build application networks that increase the speed at which they operate and innovate;\n\u2022\nour ability to include technologies for the broadening diversity of use cases and respond to the rapid evolution of new technologies;\n\u2022\nour ability to design and engineer our platform for ease-of-use across an organization; and\n\u2022\nour ability to enable customers to successfully adopt and deploy our platform in their organizations.\nThe market for application networks and our platform is still new, and therefore, it is difficult to predict the size and growth rate of this market, whether and how rapidly customers will adopt our platform, whether we will be able to retain such customers and expand their usage of our platform, and the impact of competitive products and services. If the market for application networks and Anypoint Platform does not achieve significant growth or there is a reduction in demand for solutions in our market for any reason, it could result in reduced customer adoption of our platform, decreased customer retention, or weaker customer expansion with respect to the use of our platform, any of which would adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur business and results of operations depend substantially on our customers renewing their subscriptions with us and expanding their use of our platform. Any decline in our customer renewals or failure to convince our customers to broaden their use of our platform would harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nSubscriptions to our platform are term-based and are typically one year in duration. In order for us to maintain or improve our results of operations, it is important that our customers renew their subscriptions with us when the existing subscription term expires. While our customers are not entitled to maintain the applications developed using Anypoint Platform after the termination of a subscription, they have no obligation to renew their subscriptions upon expiration. Based on our relatively limited experience selling and marketing Anypoint Platform, we may not be able to accurately predict customer renewal rates. In addition, the growth of our business depends in part on our customers expanding their use of our platform. We utilize our dollar-based net retention rate to measure our ability to retain customers and expand their use of our platform. Although our dollar-based net retention rate has historically been strong, some of our customers have elected not to renew their subscriptions with us in the past for a variety of reasons, including as a result of changes in their strategic IT priorities. Our dollar-based net retention rate may also decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of other factors, including our customers\u2019 satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our platform, the increase in the dollar value of subscription and support contracts from new customers, the effectiveness of our customer support services, our pricing, the prices of competing products or services, mergers and acquisitions affecting our customer base, global economic conditions, and the other risk factors included herein. As a result, we cannot assure you that customers will renew subscriptions or increase their usage of our platform. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions or renew on less favorable terms, or if we are unable to expand our customers\u2019 use of our platform, our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nIf we were unable to attract new customers in a manner that is cost-effective and assures customer success, we would not be able to grow our business, which would adversely affect our results of operations, and financial condition.\nIn order to grow our business, we must continue to attract new customers in a cost-effective manner and enable such customers to realize the benefits associated with an application network. We may not be able to attract new customers to our platform for a variety of reasons, including as a result of their use of traditional approaches to technology integration, such as\nmanual project-by-project integrations and the use of legacy point-to-point software integration products, their internal timing, budget, or structural constraints that hinder their ability to build application networks, or the pricing of our platform compared to products and services offered by our competitors. After a customer makes a purchasing decision, we often must also help them successfully deploy our platform in their organization, a process that can last several months. Even if we do attract customers, the cost of new customer acquisition or ongoing customer support may prove so high as to prevent us from achieving or sustaining profitability. For example, for 2017 and 2016, total sales and marketing expense represented 62% and 65% of revenue, respectively. We intend to continue to hire additional sales personnel, increase our marketing activities to help educate the market about the benefits of application networks and our platform, grow our domestic and international operations, and build brand awareness. We also intend to continue to cultivate the MuleSoft developer community and our partner ecosystem of SIs and ISVs. If the costs of these sales and marketing efforts increase dramatically, if we do not experience a substantial increase in leverage from our partner ecosystem, or if our sales and marketing efforts do not result in substantial increases in revenue, our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected. In addition, we expect to continue to invest in our professional services organization to accelerate our customers\u2019 ability to adopt our platform and ultimately create and expand the size of their application network over time. We cannot assure you that any of these investments will lead to the cost-effective acquisition of additional customers.\nWe face a number of risks in our strategy to target larger organizations for sales of our platform, and if we do not manage these efforts effectively, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe are increasingly focusing our sales and marketing efforts on larger organizations. As a result, we face a number of risks with respect to this strategy. For example, we expect to incur higher costs and longer sales cycles for larger organizations, and we may be less effective at predicting when we will complete these sales. In this market segment, the decision to invest in our platform may require a greater number of product evaluations and multiple approvals within a potential customer\u2019s organization, which may require us to invest more time educating these potential customers. In addition, larger organizations may demand more features and professional services. As a result, these sales opportunities would likely lengthen our typical sales cycle and may require us to devote greater research and development, sales, support, and professional services resources to individual customers. This could strain our resources and result in increased costs. Moreover, larger customers may demand discounts in pricing, which could lower the amount of revenue we generate from any particular subscription. If an expected transaction is delayed until a subsequent period, or if we are unable to close one or more expected significant transactions with larger customers or potential new customers in a particular period, our results of operations for that period, and for any future periods in which revenue from such transaction would otherwise have been recognized, may be adversely affected. Our investments in marketing and selling to large organizations may not be successful, which could harm our results of operations and our overall ability to grow our customer base.\nInterruptions or performance problems associated with our technology and infrastructure may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur continued growth depends in part on the ability of our existing customers and new customers to access our platform, particularly our cloud-based deployments, at any time and within an acceptable amount of time. We have experienced, and may in the future experience service disruptions, outages and other performance problems due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors or capacity constraints. In some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time. It may become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve our performance as our platform becomes more complex. If our platform is unavailable or if our customers are unable to access features of our platform within a reasonable amount of time or at all, our business would be negatively affected. In addition, our infrastructure does not currently include the real-time mirroring of data. Therefore, in the event of any of the factors described above or other failures, customer data and other important information may be permanently lost.\nWe outsource our cloud infrastructure to Amazon Web Services, or AWS, which hosts our platform. Our customers need to be able to access our platform at any time, without interruption or degradation of performance. AWS runs its own platform that we access, and we are, therefore, vulnerable to service interruptions at AWS. We have experienced, and expect that in the future we may experience interruptions, delays and outages in service and availability from time to time due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, website hosting disruptions and capacity constraints. Capacity constraints could be due to a number of potential causes including technical failures, natural disasters, fraud or security attacks. In addition, if our security, or that of AWS, is compromised, and our platform is unavailable or our customers are unable to use our platform within a reasonable amount of time or at all, then our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. In some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within a period of time acceptable to our customers. It may become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve our platform performance, especially during peak usage times, as the features of our platform become more complex and the usage of our platform increases. Any of the above circumstances or events may harm our reputation, cause customers to stop using our platform,\nimpair our ability to increase revenue from existing customers, impair our ability to grow our customer base, subject us to financial penalties and liabilities under our service level agreements and otherwise harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nTo the extent that we do not effectively anticipate capacity demands, upgrade our systems as needed, and continually develop our technology and network architecture to accommodate actual and anticipated changes in technology, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. Moreover, our customer agreements include warranties and service level agreements that obligate us to provide future credits for customers of our cloud offerings in the event of a significant disruption in our platform. Any unscheduled downtime that exceeds such service level commitments could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, business, and reputation, which in turn could harm our ability to acquire new customers and expand relationships with existing customers.\nIncorrect or improper implementation or use of our platform could result in customer dissatisfaction and negatively affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and growth prospects.\nOur platform is deployed in a wide variety of technology environments, both on-premises and in the cloud. Increasingly, our platform has been deployed in large scale, complex technology environments, and we believe our future success will depend on our ability to increase sales of our platform for use in such deployments. We must often assist our customers in achieving successful implementations of our platform, which we do through our professional services organization. The time required to implement our platform can range from three months for smaller deployments to six months or more for larger deployments. If our customers are unable to implement our platform successfully, or unable to do so in a timely manner, customer perceptions of our platform may be harmed, our reputation and brand may suffer, and customers may choose to cease usage of our platform or not to expand their use of our platform. Our customers and third-party partners may need training in the proper use of and the variety of benefits that can be derived from our platform to maximize its benefits. If our platform is not effectively implemented or used correctly or as intended, or if we fail to adequately train customers on how to efficiently and effectively use our platform, our customers may not be able to build application networks or otherwise achieve satisfactory outcomes. This could result in negative publicity and legal claims against us, which may cause us to generate fewer sales to new customers and reductions in renewals or expansions of the use of our platform with existing customers, any of which would harm our business and results of operations.\nIf our security measures are breached or unauthorized access to private or proprietary data is otherwise obtained, our platform may be perceived as not being secure, customers may reduce the use of or stop using our platform, and we may incur significant liabilities.\nBecause our platform allows customers to store and transmit data, there exists an inherent risk that an unauthorized third party could conduct a security breach, resulting in the loss of this data, which could lead to litigation, indemnity obligations, and other liability. While we have taken steps to protect the confidential information to which we have access, we do not have the ability to monitor or review the content that our customers store or transmit through our platform. Therefore, if customers use our software for the transmission or storage of personally identifiable information and our security measures are breached as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, our reputation could be damaged, our business may suffer, and we could incur significant liability. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any or all of these issues could negatively impact our ability to attract new customers and increase engagement by existing customers, cause existing customers to elect not to renew their subscriptions, or subject us to third-party lawsuits, regulatory fines or other action or liability, thereby adversely affecting our financial results.\nIf we fail to adapt and respond effectively to rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, changing regulations and changing customer needs, requirements or preferences, our products may become less competitive.\nThe market in which we compete is relatively new and subject to rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and changing regulations, as well as changing customer needs, requirements and preferences. The success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to adapt and respond effectively to these changes on a timely basis. If we were unable to enhance our platform or develop new solutions that keep pace with rapid technological and industry change, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected. If new technologies emerge that are able to deliver competitive products and services at lower prices, more efficiently, more conveniently or more securely, such technologies could adversely impact our ability to compete effectively. For example, Anypoint Platform was architected to connect and orchestrate applications, data and devices through the use of APIs. If new technologies emerge that displace the use of APIs, we may not be able to adapt our platform to such new technologies on a timely basis.\nOur success also depends on the interoperability of our platform with third-party applications, data and devices that we have not developed and do not control. Any changes in such applications, data or devices that degrade the functionality of our platform or give preferential treatment to competitive software could adversely affect the adoption and usage of our platform. We may not be successful in adapting our platform to operate effectively with these applications, data or devices. If it is difficult for our customers to access and use our platform, or if our platform cannot connect a broadening range of applications, data and devices, then our customer growth and retention may be harmed, and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur future quarterly results may fluctuate significantly, and if we fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors, our stock price and the value of your investment could decline substantially.\nOur results of operations, including our revenue, operating expenses and cash flows have fluctuated from quarter to quarter in the past and may continue to fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, may be difficult to predict and may or may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business. Some of the factors that may cause our results of operations to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include:\n\u2022\nthe mix of revenue and associated costs attributable to subscriptions and support and professional services, which may impact our gross margins and operating income;\n\u2022\nour ability to attract new customers;\n\u2022\nour ability to retain customers and expand their usage of our platform, particularly for our largest customers;\n\u2022\ndelays in closing sales, including the timing of renewals, which may result in revenue being pushed into the next quarter, particularly because a large portion of our sales occur toward the end of each quarter;\n\u2022\nthe timing of revenue recognition;\n\u2022\nthe mix of revenue attributable to larger transactions as opposed to smaller transactions;\n\u2022\nchanges in customers\u2019 budgets and in the timing of their purchasing decisions;\n\u2022\npotential customers opting for alternative products, including developing their own in-house solutions;\n\u2022\nour ability to control costs, including our operating expenses;\n\u2022\nthe timing and success of new products, features and services by us and our competitors or any other change in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including consolidation among competitors, customers or strategic partners;\n\u2022\nsignificant security breaches of, technical difficulties with, or interruptions to, the delivery and use of our platform;\n\u2022\nthe collectability of receivables from customers and resellers, which may be hindered or delayed if these customers or resellers experience financial distress;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions, both domestically and internationally, as well as economic conditions specifically affecting industries in which our customers participate;\n\u2022\nsales tax and other tax determinations by authorities in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business;\n\u2022\nthe impact of new accounting pronouncements; and\n\u2022\nfluctuations in stock-based compensation expense.\nThe occurrence of one or more of the foregoing and other factors may cause our results of operations to vary significantly. We also intend to continue to invest significantly to grow our business in the near future rather than optimizing for profitability or cash flows. Accordingly, our results of operations in any one quarter may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicative of future performance. Additionally, if our quarterly results of operations fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts who follow our stock, the price of our Class A common stock could decline substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors.\nWe believe that we are the pioneer in the market for application networks because we provide the only complete offering for building application networks. However, there are many other companies addressing various aspects of this market. As a result, the competitive landscape is fragmented, intense and characterized by rapid changes in technology, customer requirements, and industry standards and by frequent new product introductions and improvements. We are likely to face continued challenges from current competitors, which include:\n\u2022\nmanual integration efforts, which are either conducted in-house or through custom integration services providers;\n\u2022\nlegacy integration software vendors such as IBM, Oracle, and TIBCO; and\n\u2022\nsmaller specialized companies such as Apigee (owned by Alphabet) and Dell Boomi, which are focused on various niches in integration and API management.\nMany of our principal competitors have substantially longer operating histories, greater financial, technical, marketing or other resources, stronger brand and customer recognition, larger intellectual property portfolios and broader global distribution and presence. Our competitors may be able to offer products or functionality similar to ours at a more attractive price than we can by integrating or bundling such products with their other product offerings. Acquisitions and consolidation in our industry may provide our competitors even more resources or may increase the likelihood of our competitors offering bundled or integrated products with which we cannot effectively compete. In addition, we face potential competition from participants in adjacent markets that may enter our markets by leveraging related technologies and partnering with or acquiring other companies, or providing alternative approaches to provide similar results, particularly as organizations are increasingly choosing to deploy applications on cloud platforms such as those offered by AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. New innovative start-ups and existing large companies that are making significant investments in research and development could also launch new products and services, delivered either on-premises or in the cloud, that we do not offer and that could gain market acceptance quickly. If we were unable to anticipate or react to these competitive challenges, our competitive position would weaken, which would adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nReal or perceived errors, failures or bugs in our software could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and growth prospects.\nOur platform is complex, and therefore, undetected errors, failures or bugs may occur. Our platform may be used in IT environments with different operating systems, system management software, applications, devices, databases and equipment and networking configurations, which may cause errors or failures of our platform or other aspects of the IT environment into which it is deployed. Despite testing by us, errors, failures or bugs may not be found until our platform is used by our customers. Real or perceived errors, failures or bugs in our products could result in negative publicity, loss of or delay in market acceptance of our platform, weakening of our competitive position, claims by customers for losses sustained by them or failure to meet the stated service level commitments in our customer agreements. In such an event, we may be required, or may choose, for customer relations or other reasons, to expend significant additional resources in order to help correct the problem. We have experienced from time to time errors, failures and bugs in our platform that have resulted in customer downtime. While we were able to remedy these situations, we cannot assure you that we will be able to mitigate future errors, failures or bugs in a quick or cost-effective manner. Any errors, failures or bugs in our platform could impair our ability to attract new customers, retain existing customers or expand their use of our platform, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur sales cycle is long and unpredictable, and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense.\nThe timing of our sales and related revenue recognition is difficult to predict because of the length and unpredictability of the sales cycle for our platform before a sale. We are often required to spend significant time and resources to better educate and familiarize potential customers with the value proposition of our platform. Customers often view the subscription to our platform as a strategic decision and significant investment and, as a result, frequently require considerable time to evaluate, test and qualify our platform prior to entering into or expanding a subscription. During the sales cycle, we expend significant time and money on sales and marketing and contract negotiation activities, which may not result in a sale. Additional factors that may influence the length and variability of our sales cycle include:\n\u2022\nthe discretionary nature of purchasing and budget cycles and decisions;\n\u2022\nlengthy purchasing approval processes;\n\u2022\nthe evaluation of competing products during the purchasing process;\n\u2022\nannouncements or planned introductions of new products, features or functionality by us or our competitors; and\n\u2022\nevolving functionality demands.\nAs we have focused our business on selling into larger customer accounts, we have experienced an increase in our average sales cycle from two to three quarters. As a result, it is difficult to predict whether and when a sale will be completed, and when revenue from a sale will be recognized. If our sales cycles continue to lengthen, our revenue could be lower than expected, which would have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe recognize a majority of our revenue over the term of our customer contracts. Consequently, increases or decreases in new sales may not be immediately reflected in our results of operations and may be difficult to discern.\nWe recognize subscription revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscriptions and a substantial majority of our revenue is derived from subscriptions that have terms of at least one year. As a result, a portion of the revenue we report in each quarter is derived from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to subscriptions entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any single quarter may have a small impact on the revenue that we recognize for that quarter. However, such a decline will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the\neffect of significant downturns in sales and potential changes in our pricing policies or rate of customer expansion or retention, may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. In addition, a significant majority of our costs are expensed as incurred, while revenue is recognized over the life of the subscription agreement. As a result, growth in the number of customers could continue to result in our recognition of higher costs and lower revenue in the earlier periods of our subscription agreements. Finally, our subscription-based revenue model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers and significant increases in the size of subscriptions with existing customers must be recognized over the applicable subscription term.\nIf we do not effectively expand our sales and marketing organization, we may be unable to add new customers or increase sales to our existing customers.\nIncreasing our customer base and achieving broader market acceptance of our platform will depend, to a significant extent, on our ability to effectively expand our sales and marketing operations and activities. We are substantially dependent on our direct sales force and our online marketing efforts to obtain new customers. We plan to continue to expand our sales and marketing organization both domestically and internationally. We believe that there is significant competition for experienced sales professionals with the sales skills and technical knowledge that we require, particularly as we continue to target larger organizations. Our ability to achieve significant revenue growth in the future will depend, in part, on our success in recruiting, training and retaining a sufficient number of experienced sales professionals. New hires require significant training and time before they achieve full productivity, particularly in new sales segments and territories. Our recent hires and planned hires may not become as productive as quickly as we expect, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the future in the markets where we do business. Because of our limited operating history, we cannot predict whether, or to what extent, our sales will increase as we expand our sales and marketing organization or how long it will take for sales personnel to become productive. Our business and results of operations will be harmed if the expansion of our sales and marketing organization does not generate a significant increase in revenue.\nWe depend on highly skilled personnel to grow and operate our business, and if we are unable to hire, retain, train and motivate our personnel, we may not be able to effectively grow our business and improve our results of operations.\nWe depend on highly skilled personnel, including our senior management, to grow and operate our business. Our future success will depend upon our continued ability to identify and hire skilled personnel, including senior management, engineers, product managers and sales and marketing personnel, which will require significant time, expense and attention. We have aggressive hiring objectives across the organization, which we may not be able to achieve. In addition to hiring new employees, we must continue to focus on training, motivating, and retaining our best employees, substantially all of whom are at-will employees, which means they may terminate their employment relationship with us at any time. Many of our employees may be able to receive significant proceeds from sales of our Class A common stock in the public markets, which may reduce their motivation to continue to work for us. Conversely, employees may be more likely to leave us if the exercise prices of the stock options that they hold are significantly above the market price of our Class A common stock. Competition for highly skilled personnel is intense, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area, where our headquarters are located. We may need to invest significant amounts of cash and equity to attract and retain new employees, and we may never realize returns on these investments. If we are not able to fulfill our hiring objectives and retain employees, our ability to achieve our strategic objectives would be adversely impacted, and our business and results of operations would be harmed.\nOur corporate culture has contributed to our success, and if we cannot maintain this culture as we grow, we could lose the innovation, creativity and teamwork fostered by our culture, which could harm our business.\nWe believe that our culture has been and will continue to be a key contributor to our success. Since December 31, 2015, we have increased the size of our workforce by over 500 employees, and we expect to continue to hire aggressively as we expand. If we do not continue to maintain our corporate culture as we grow, we may be unable to foster the innovation, creativity, and teamwork we believe we need to support our growth. Moreover, many of our employees may be able to receive significant proceeds from sales of our Class A common stock in the public markets, which could lead to disparities of wealth among our employees that adversely affects relations among employees and our culture in general.\nIf we were not able to introduce new features, solutions or services successfully and to make enhancements to our platform or services, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to attract new customers and increase revenue from existing customers depends in large part on our ability to enhance and improve our platform and to introduce new features, solutions, and services. To grow our business and remain competitive, we must enhance our platform and develop features and solutions that reflect the constantly evolving nature of technology and our customers\u2019 needs. The success of these and any other enhancements or developments depend on several factors,\nincluding timely introduction and completion, sufficient demand and cost effectiveness. In addition, because our platform is designed to operate with a variety of systems, applications, data and devices, we will need to continuously modify and enhance our platform to keep pace with changes in such systems. We may not be successful in developing these modifications and enhancements. Furthermore, the addition of features and solutions to our platform will increase our research and development expenses. Any new features or solutions that we develop may not be introduced in a timely or cost-effective manner or may not achieve the market acceptance necessary to generate sufficient revenue to justify the related expenses. It is difficult to predict customer adoption of new features or solutions. Such uncertainty limits our ability to forecast our future results of operations and subjects us to a number of challenges, including our ability to plan for and model future growth. If we cannot address such uncertainties successfully and are unable to successfully develop new features or solutions, enhance our platform or otherwise overcome technological challenges and competing technologies, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. We also offer professional services for the implementation of, and training on, our platform and must continually adapt to assist our customers in deploying our platform and building an application network in accordance with their specific IT strategy. If we cannot introduce new services or enhance our existing services to keep pace with changes in our customers\u2019 deployment strategies, we may not be able to attract new customers, retain existing customers and expand their use of our platform, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our revenue from professional services, which carry a lower gross margin than our subscription and support revenue.\nWe generally offer professional services associated with implementing our platform and training customers on the use of our platform, and our professional services carry a significantly lower gross margin than subscriptions for our platform. We price our professional services to be attractive to customers because we believe that our professional services help ensure customer success on our platform, which assists us in retaining customers and expanding our relationships with them. Further, we generally recognize revenue from professional services as such services are rendered. Costs associated with maintaining a professional services organization are fixed while professional services revenue is dependent on the amount of work actually billed to customers in a period, the combination of which may result in variability in our gross profit. In addition, the timing of the recognition of professional services revenue is dependent on several factors outside our control. If a customer deploys our platform and utilizes our services more slowly than we expect, we may not be able to recognize the related revenue as quickly as we anticipated, which may adversely affect our gross profit and other results of operations. We also work with SIs to provide our customers with professional services associated with implementing our platform, and we plan to continue to expand these partner relationships to supplement our own resources. If we are not able to adequately grow these channel partner relationships, we will continue to directly provide a significant majority of these services to our customers.\nAny failure to offer high-quality customer support may adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our financial results.\nWe typically bundle customer support with subscriptions for our platform. In deploying and using our platform, our customers typically require the assistance of our support teams to resolve complex technical and operational issues. We may be unable to modify the nature, scope and delivery of our customer support to compete with changes in product support services provided by our competitors. Increased customer demand for support, without corresponding revenue, could increase costs and adversely affect our results of operations. We may also be unable to respond quickly enough to accommodate short-term increases in customer demand for support. Our sales are highly dependent on our reputation and on positive recommendations from our existing customers. Any failure to maintain high-quality customer support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality product support, could adversely affect our reputation, and our ability to sell subscriptions to our platform to existing customers and new customers.\nFuture changes in market conditions or customer demand could require changes to our prices or pricing model, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe price subscriptions to our platform based on the amount of computing capacity on which our customers run our software, as well as the tier of support services, and subscriptions to our platform are typically one year in duration. We have limited experience with respect to determining the optimal prices and pricing model for our platform and services. As the market for our platform matures, or as new competitors introduce new products or services that compete with ours, we may be unable to attract new customers at the same price or based on the same pricing models as we have used historically. For example, from time to time, customers request pricing that dynamically scales up or down based on actual usage, which is different than our 12-month capacity-based pricing. If this customer demand becomes more prevalent, we may be forced to adjust our pricing model. Any future changes in our pricing model could result in decreased revenue or interfere with the predictability of our business. Moreover, larger organizations, which are a primary focus of our sales efforts, may demand substantial price concessions. As a result, in the\nfuture we may be required to reduce our prices, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe believe that maintaining and enhancing our reputation as a pioneer and leader in the market for application networks is critical to our relationship with our existing customers and partners and our ability to attract new customers and partners. The successful promotion of our brand attributes will depend on a number of factors, including our marketing efforts, our ability to continue to develop high-quality features and solutions for our platform and our ability to successfully differentiate our platform from competitive products and services. Our brand promotion activities may not be successful or yield increased revenue. In addition, independent industry analysts often provide reviews of our platform, as well as products and services of our competitors, and perception of our platform in the marketplace may be significantly influenced by these reviews. If these reviews are negative, or less positive as compared to those of our competitors\u2019 products and services, our brand may be adversely affected. Additionally, the performance of our channel partners may affect our brand and reputation if customers do not have a positive experience with our partners\u2019 services. The promotion of our brand requires us to make substantial expenditures, and we anticipate that the expenditures will increase as our market becomes more competitive, as we expand into new markets, and as more sales are generated through our channel partners. To the extent that these activities yield increased revenue, this revenue may not offset the increased expenses we incur. If we do not successfully maintain and enhance our brand, our business may not grow, we may have reduced pricing power relative to competitors, and we could lose customers or fail to attract potential customers, all of which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business and growth depend in part on the success of our relationships with our channel partners.\nIn addition to our direct sales force, we use SIs and VARs. We derive a significant portion of our revenue from sales through our channel network, particularly internationally. We expect that sales through channel partners will continue to grow for the foreseeable future.\nOur agreements with our channel partners are generally non-exclusive, meaning our channel partners may offer customers the products of several different companies, including products that compete with our platform. If our channel partners do not effectively market and sell subscriptions to our platform, choose to use greater efforts to market and sell their own products or those of our competitors, or fail to meet the needs of our customers, our ability to grow our business and sell subscriptions to our platform may be adversely affected. Our channel partners may cease marketing our platform with limited or no notice and with little or no penalty. The loss of a substantial number of our channel partners, our possible inability to replace them, or the failure to recruit additional channel partners could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend in part on our ecosystem of SIs and developers to create solutions that will work in conjunction with our platform.\nWe depend in part on our partner ecosystem of SIs and developers to create solutions that will work in conjunction with our platform. This presents certain risks to our business, including:\n\u2022\nwe cannot provide any assurance that these solutions meet the same quality standards that we apply to our own development efforts, and to the extent that they contain bugs or defects, they may create disruptions in our customers\u2019 use of our services or negatively affect our brand;\n\u2022\nwe do not typically provide technical support for solutions developed by our partner ecosystem, and customers may be left without support and potentially cease using our services if these SIs and developers do not provide adequate support for those solutions; and\n\u2022\nthese SIs and developers may not possess the appropriate intellectual property rights to develop and share their solutions.\nMany of these risks are not within our control to prevent, and our brand may be damaged if these solutions do not perform to our customers\u2019 satisfaction and that dissatisfaction is attributed to us, which would adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur corporate structure and intercompany arrangements are subject to the tax laws of various jurisdictions, and we could be obligated to pay additional taxes, which would harm our results of operations.\nBased on our current corporate structure, we may be subject to taxation in several jurisdictions around the world with increasingly complex tax laws, the application of which can be uncertain. The amount of taxes we pay in these jurisdictions could increase substantially as a result of changes in the applicable tax principles, including increased tax rates, new tax laws or revised\ninterpretations of existing tax laws and precedents. In addition, the authorities in these jurisdictions could challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, including our transfer pricing. The relevant taxing authorities may determine that the manner in which we operate our business does not achieve the intended tax consequences. If such a disagreement were to occur, and our position were not sustained, we could be required to pay additional taxes, and interest and penalties. Such authorities could claim that various withholding requirements apply to us or our subsidiaries or assert that benefits of tax treaties are not available to us or our subsidiaries. Any increase in the amount of taxes we pay or that are imposed on us could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our business and results of operations.\nChanges in U.S. tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations or financial conditions.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (\"the Act\") was signed into law, which enacts significant changes to U.S. tax and related laws. Some of the provisions of the new tax law affecting corporations include, but are not limited to a reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, limiting the interest expense deduction, expensing of cost of acquired qualified property and elimination of the domestic production activities deduction. In addition, changes have been made regarding the taxation of undistributed foreign earnings. We have analyzed the potential impacts of the Act and due to the federal rate reduction, we have recorded a reduction in our federal deferred tax assets of $29.4 million which was offset by a change in our valuation allowance; both changes are reflected in our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. Going forward, we will consider the impact of these changes as we evaluate our future intentions regarding the reinvestment of our undistributed foreign earnings.\nWe could incur substantial costs in protecting or defending our intellectual property rights, and any failure to protect our intellectual property rights could reduce the value of our platform and brand.\nOur success and ability to compete depend in part upon our intellectual property rights. We currently have one issued patent and three patent applications, which may not result in issued patents. We primarily rely on copyright, trademark laws, trade secret protection and confidentiality or other contractual arrangements with our employees, customers, partners and others to protect our intellectual property rights. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate. In order to protect our intellectual property rights, we may be required to spend significant resources to set-up, monitor and enforce such rights. Litigation brought to enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management and could be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights, which may result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and effective intellectual property protection and mechanisms may not be available in those jurisdictions. We may need to expend additional resources to defend our intellectual property in these countries, and our inability to do so could impair our business or adversely affect our international expansion. Even if we are able to secure our intellectual property rights, there can be no assurances that such rights will provide us with competitive advantages or distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology.\nWe may be subject to intellectual property rights claims by third parties, which may be costly to defend, could require us to pay significant damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies.\nCompanies in the software and technology industries, including some of our current and potential competitors, own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have in the past and may in the future be subject to notices that claim we have misappropriated, misused or infringed the intellectual property rights of our competitors or other third parties, including patent holding companies whose sole business is to assert such claims. To the extent we increase our visibility in the market, we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims. Additionally, we do not have a significant patent portfolio, which could prevent us from deterring patent infringement claims through our own patent portfolio, and our competitors and others may now and in the future have significantly larger and more mature patent portfolios than we have.\nAny intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be very time-consuming and expensive and could divert our management\u2019s attention and other resources. These claims could also subject us to significant liability for damages, potentially including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed patents or copyrights. These claims could also result in our having to stop using technology found to be in violation of a third party\u2019s rights. We might be required to seek a license for the intellectual property, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. Even if a license is available, we could be required to pay significant royalties, which would increase our operating expenses. As a result, we may be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort and expense. If we cannot license or develop technology for any\naspect of our business that may ultimately be determined to infringe on the intellectual property rights of another party, we could be forced to limit or stop sales of subscriptions to our platform and may be unable to compete effectively. Any of these results would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSome of our technology incorporates \u201copen source\u201d software, and we license some of our software through open source projects, which could negatively affect our ability to sell our platform and subject us to possible litigation.\nSome aspects of our platform are built using open source software, and we intend to continue to use open source software in the future. From time to time, we contribute software source code to open source projects under open source licenses or release internal software projects under open source licenses, and anticipate doing so in the future. The terms of certain open source licenses to which we are subject have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and there is a risk that open source software licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to monetize our platform. Additionally, we may from time to time face claims from third parties claiming ownership of, or demanding release of, the open source software or derivative works that we developed using such software, which could include our proprietary source code, or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. These claims could result in litigation and could require us to make our software source code freely available, purchase a costly license or cease offering the implicated services unless and until we can re-engineer them to avoid infringement. This re-engineering process could require significant additional research and development resources, and we may not be able to complete it successfully. In addition to risks related to license requirements, use of certain open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of software. Additionally, because any software source code we contribute to open source projects is publicly available, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights with respect to such software source code may be limited or lost entirely, and we may be unable to prevent our competitors or others from using such contributed software source code. Any of these risks could be difficult to eliminate or manage, and if not addressed, could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe use third-party licensed software in or with our platform, and the inability to maintain these licenses or errors in the software we license could result in increased costs or reduced service levels, which would adversely affect our business.\nOur platform incorporates certain third-party software obtained under licenses from other companies. We anticipate that we will continue to rely on such third-party software and development tools in the future. Such third-party companies may discontinue their products, go out of business or otherwise cease to make support available for such third-party software. Although we believe that there are commercially reasonable alternatives to the third-party software we currently license, this may not always be the case, or it may be difficult or costly to replace. In addition, integration of the software used in our platform with new third-party software may require significant work and substantial investment of our time and resources. Also, to the extent that our platform depends upon the successful operation of third-party software in conjunction with our software, any undetected errors or defects in such third-party software could prevent the deployment or impair the functionality of our platform, delay new feature introductions, result in a failure of our platform and injure our reputation. Our use of additional or alternative third-party software would require us to enter into license agreements with third parties. In the event that we are not able to maintain our licenses to third-party software, or cannot obtain licenses to new software on commercially reasonable terms as needed to enhance our platform, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIndemnity provisions in various agreements potentially expose us to substantial liability for intellectual property infringement and other losses.\nOur agreements with customers and other third parties may include indemnification provisions under which we agree to indemnify them for losses suffered or incurred as a result of claims of intellectual property infringement, damages caused by us to property or persons, or other liabilities relating to or arising from our platform, services or other contractual obligations. Some of these indemnity agreements provide for uncapped liability for which we would be responsible, and some indemnity provisions survive termination or expiration of the applicable agreement. Large indemnity payments could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Although we normally contractually limit our liability with respect to such obligations, we may still incur substantial liability related to them. Any dispute with a customer with respect to such obligations could have adverse effects on our relationship with that customer and other existing customers and new customers and harm our business and results of operations.\nOur international sales and international operations subject us to additional risks that can adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nFor both 2017 and 2016, we derived approximately 38% of our revenue from customers located outside the United States. We are continuing to expand our international operations as part of our growth strategy. We currently have a significant\nportion of our research and development personnel in Argentina and have a significant portion of our sales personnel and customer support operations in Europe, Asia, Australia and South America. However, our sales organization outside the United States is smaller than our sales organization in the United States, and we rely more on resellers for non-U.S. sales. Our ability to convince customers to adopt our platform and to expand usage of our platform often requires our direct engagement with customers. To the extent we are unable to engage with non-U.S. customers, we may struggle to grow sales in international markets.\nOur international operations subject us to a variety of risks and challenges, including:\n\u2022\npolitical and economic uncertainty in the locations in which we operate, particularly in Argentina, where we have a development center, including the potential for significant inflation, labor unrest and currency devaluation;\n\u2022\nincreased management, travel, infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with having operations in multiple jurisdictions;\n\u2022\ngreater challenges in hiring, training, motivating, and retaining high-quality personnel;\n\u2022\nincreased difficulties in maintaining our unique corporate culture as we continue to expand globally;\n\u2022\nreliance on channel partners;\n\u2022\nlonger sales cycle and more time required to educate customers on the benefits of our platform outside of the United States;\n\u2022\nmore challenges in enabling our sales force to reach larger organizations outside of the United States;\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable, especially in emerging markets;\n\u2022\nincreased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n\u2022\ncompliance with U.S. laws and regulations for foreign operations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act, import and export control laws, tariffs, trade barriers, economic sanctions and other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to sell subscriptions to our software in certain foreign markets, and the risks and costs of non-compliance;\n\u2022\nheightened risks of unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies and of improper or fraudulent sales arrangements that may impact results of operations and result in restatements of our consolidated financial statements and irregularities in our consolidated financial statements;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates, particularly in Argentina, and the related effect on our results of operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in repatriating or transferring funds from or converting currencies in certain countries;\n\u2022\nthe need for localized software and licensing programs;\n\u2022\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries and practical difficulties of enforcing intellectual property and contract rights abroad;\n\u2022\ncompliance with the laws of numerous foreign taxing jurisdictions and overlapping of different tax regimes including withholding obligations; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties associated with delivering support, training and documentation in languages other than English.\nAny of the above risks could adversely affect our international operations, reduce our revenue from customers outside of the United States or increase our operating costs, each of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects. In addition, compliance with laws and regulations applicable to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. We may be unable to keep current with changes in foreign government requirements and laws as they change from time to time. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could have adverse effects on our business. In many foreign countries it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or U.S. regulations applicable to us. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and policies, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors, channel partners and agents will comply with these laws and policies. Violations of laws or key control policies by our employees, contractors, channel partners or agents could result in delays in revenue recognition, financial reporting misstatements, fines, penalties or the prohibition of the importation or exportation of our software and services and could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nA significant number of our research and development employees are located in Argentina and any favorable or unfavorable developments in Argentina could have an impact on our results of operations.\nA significant number of our research and development employees are located in Argentina, and therefore, a portion of our operating expenses are denominated in Argentine pesos. As of December 31, 2017, we had a total of 225 employees located in Argentina, of which 159 were engaged in research and development activities. If the peso strengthens against the U.S. dollar, it could have a negative impact on our results of operations as it would increase our operating expenses. Our business activities in Argentina also subject us to risks associated with changes in and interpretations of Argentine law, including laws related to employment, the protection and ownership of intellectual property and U.S. ownership of Argentine operations. Furthermore, if\nwe had to scale down or close our Argentine operations, there would be significant time and cost required to relocate those operations elsewhere, which could have an adverse impact on our overall cost structure.\nThe Argentine government has historically exercised significant influence over the country\u2019s economy. Additionally, the country\u2019s legal and regulatory frameworks have at times suffered radical changes, due to political influence and significant political uncertainties. In the past, government policies in Argentina included expropriation, nationalization, forced renegotiation or modification of existing contracts, suspension of the enforcement of creditors\u2019 rights, new taxation policies, including royalty and tax increases and retroactive tax claims, and changes in laws and policies affecting foreign trade and investment. Such policies could destabilize the country and adversely affect our business and operating expenses.\nIn addition, Argentina has experienced labor unrest over wages and benefits paid to workers. In the past, the Argentine government has passed laws, regulations, and decrees requiring companies in the private sector to maintain minimum wage levels and provide specified benefits to employees and may do so again in the future. Employers have also experienced significant pressure from their employees and labor organizations to increase wages and to provide additional employee benefits. Any disruptions, labor unrest, or increased personnel-related expenses in Argentina could have a material and adverse effect on our business and operating expenses.\nIf currency exchange rates fluctuate substantially in the future, our financial results, which are reported in U.S. dollars, could be adversely affected.\nAs we continue to expand our international operations, we become more exposed to the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Our sales contracts are denominated primarily in U.S. dollars, and therefore the majority of our revenue is not subject to foreign currency risk. However, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar could increase the real cost of our platform and services to our customers outside of the United States, adversely affecting our business, results of operations and financial condition. We incur expenses for employee compensation and other operating expenses at our non-U.S. locations in the local currency. Fluctuations in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies, such as the Argentine peso, could result in the dollar equivalent of such expenses being higher. This could have a negative impact on our reported results of operations. To date, we have not engaged in any hedging strategies, and any such strategies, such as forward contracts, options and foreign exchange swaps related to transaction exposures that we may implement in the future to mitigate this risk may not eliminate our exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations. Moreover, the use of hedging instruments may introduce additional risks if we are unable to structure effective hedges with such instruments.\nUnfavorable conditions in our industry or the global economy or reductions in information technology spending could limit our ability to grow our business and negatively affect our results of operations.\nOur results of operations may vary based on the impact of changes in our industry or the global economy on us or our customers. The revenue growth and potential profitability of our business depend on demand for integration software and services generally and for our platform in particular. Current or future economic uncertainties or downturns could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Negative conditions in the general economy both in the United States and abroad, including conditions resulting from changes in gross domestic product growth, financial and credit market fluctuations, political turmoil, natural catastrophes, warfare and terrorist attacks on the United States, Europe, the Asia Pacific region or elsewhere, could cause a decrease in business investments, including spending on information technology, and negatively affect the growth of our business. To the extent our platform is perceived by customers and potential customers as discretionary, our revenue may be disproportionately affected by delays or reductions in general information technology spending. Also, customers may choose to develop in-house software as an alternative to using our platform. Moreover, competitors may respond to market conditions by lowering prices and attempting to lure away our customers. In addition, the increased pace of consolidation in certain industries may result in reduced overall spending on our platform. We cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic slowdown, instability or recovery, generally or within any particular industry. If the economic conditions of the general economy or markets in which we operate do not improve, or worsen from present levels, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets due to licensing requirements and subject us to liability if we are not in compliance with applicable laws.\nOur platform is subject to export controls, including the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Export Administration Regulations and various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Controls. The U.S. export control laws and U.S. economic sanctions laws include prohibitions on the sale or supply of certain products and services to U.S. embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments, persons and entities and also require authorization for the export of encryption items. In addition, various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology,\nincluding through import permitting and licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our platform or could limit our customers\u2019 ability to implement our platform in those countries. Although we take precautions to prevent our platform from being provided or deployed in violation of such laws, our platform may have been in the past, and could in the future be, provided inadvertently in violation of such laws, despite the precautions we take. For example, in September 2016, we filed a voluntary self-disclosure regarding our past failure to seek and receive an export license prior to distribution of encrypted software. In response to this voluntary self-disclosure, we received a written warning from the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security. If we fail to comply with these laws, we and our employees could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of export privileges, monetary penalties, and, in extreme cases, imprisonment of responsible employees for knowing and willful violations of these laws. We may also be adversely affected through penalties, reputational harm, loss of access to certain markets, or otherwise.\nChanges in our platform, or changes in export, sanctions and import laws, may delay the introduction and sale of subscriptions to our platform in international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our platform or, in some cases, prevent the provision of our platform to certain countries, governments, persons or entities altogether. Any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related laws, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our platform, or in our decreased ability to export or sell subscriptions to our platform to existing customers or potential new customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our platform or limitation on our ability to export or sell subscriptions to our platform could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure to comply with anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and anti-money laundering laws could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nWe are subject to the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-corruption, anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in various jurisdictions both domestic and abroad. We leverage third parties, including channel partners, to sell subscriptions to our platform and conduct our business abroad. We and our third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party business partners and intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, channel partners, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. While we have policies and procedures to address compliance with such laws, we cannot assure you that all of our employees and agents will not take actions in violation of our policies and applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. Any violation of the FCPA or other applicable anti-bribery, anti-corruption laws, and anti-money laundering laws could result in whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions, or suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracts, all of which may have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, operating results and prospects.\nIf we were not able to satisfy data protection, security, privacy and other government-and industry-specific requirements, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be harmed.\nPersonal privacy has become a significant issue in the United States and in many other countries where we offer our platform. The regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. Many federal, state and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations regarding the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of personal information. In the United States, these include, among others, rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the Federal Trade Commission, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 and state breach notification laws. Internationally, many of the jurisdictions in which we operate have established their own data security, data protection, and privacy legal frameworks with which we or our customers must comply. These privacy, data protection and information security laws and regulations may result in ever-increasing regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions. Additionally, new laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, and information security continue to be proposed and enacted. For example, the European Union has adopted a General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), to supersede the Data Protection Directive. This regulation, which will take full effect on May 25, 2018, will cause EU data protection requirements to be more stringent and provide for greater penalties. Noncompliance with the GDPR can trigger fines of up to \u20ac20 million or 4% of global annual revenue, whichever is higher.\nThe privacy, data protection, and information security laws and regulations we must comply with also are subject to change. For example, in June 2016, United Kingdom voters approved an exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit,\u201d which could also lead to further legislative and regulatory changes. In March 2017, the United Kingdom began the process to leave the EU by April 2019. A Data Protection Bill has been introduced to the United Kingdom\u2019s House of Lords that proposes to substantially implement the GDPR. Nevertheless, the Data Protection Bill must complete the legislative process, so it remains unclear what modifications will be made to the final legislation. Additionally, an October 2015 ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union invalidated the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework as a method of compliance with European\nrestrictions regarding the transfer of personal data outside of the European Economic Area, or EEA. Additionally, U.S. and EU authorities reached a political agreement in February 2016 regarding a new means for legitimizing personal data transfers from the EEA to the U.S., the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, and we have joined the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and a related program, the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. The EU-U.S. Privacy Shield is subject to legal challenge, however, and it or the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield may be modified or invalidated. We may be unsuccessful in maintaining legitimate means for our transfer and receipt of personal data from the EEA or Switzerland. We may experience reluctance or refusal by current or prospective European customers to use our products, and we may find it necessary or desirable to make further changes to our handling of personal data of European residents.\nIn addition to government regulation, privacy advocates and industry groups may propose new and different self-regulatory obligations or industry standards that may legally or contractually apply to us. The interpretation and application of privacy, data protection, and information security laws, regulations, and other obligations are uncertain and subject to change, and it is possible that current or future laws, regulations, and other obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing or future practices or the features of our software. If so, in addition to the possibility of regulatory investigations, fines, lawsuits and other claims, we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our software or our practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Additionally, any inability to adequately address privacy, data protection, or information security concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable privacy, data protection, or information security laws, regulations and policies, could result in additional cost and liability to us, damage our reputation, inhibit sales and adversely affect our business, results of operation, and financial condition.\nFurthermore, the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, the laws, regulations and policies that are applicable to the businesses of our customers may limit the use and adoption of, and reduce the overall demand for, our software. Privacy, data protection, and information security concerns, whether valid or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our platform particularly in certain industries and foreign countries.\nThe nature of our business requires the application of complex revenue and expense recognition rules and the current legislative and regulatory environment affecting GAAP is uncertain. Significant changes in current principles could affect our consolidated financial statements going forward and changes in financial accounting standards or practices may cause adverse, unexpected financial reporting fluctuations and harm our results of operations.\nThe accounting rules and regulations that we must comply with are complex and subject to interpretation by the FASB, the SEC, and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. In addition, many companies\u2019 accounting disclosures are being subjected to heightened scrutiny by regulators and the public. Further, the accounting rules and regulations are continually changing in ways that could impact our financial statements. For example, in May 2014, FASB issued new accounting guidance on revenue recognition, Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), that became effective for us on January 1, 2018. The standard permits the use of either a retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. In addition, we have also considered the impact of the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 340-40, Other Assets and Deferred Costs; Contracts with Customers, under ASU 2014-09.\nWe will apply the standard retrospectively to each prior period presented. The application of this new guidance could have an adverse effect on our net income or loss. In Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we disclose quantitative ranges as estimates of the expected effects of our adoption of ASU 2014-09. Changes to accounting principles or our accounting policies on our financial statements going forward are difficult to predict and could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of the change. In addition, were we to change our critical accounting estimates, including the timing of recognition of license revenue and other revenue sources, our results of operations could be significantly impacted.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the rules and regulations of the applicable listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. We expect that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming and costly, and place significant strain on our personnel, systems and resources.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we will file with the SEC is recorded,\nprocessed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and financial officers. We are also continuing to improve our internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources, including accounting-related costs and significant management oversight.\nOur current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. Further, weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we will eventually be required to include in our periodic reports that will be filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our Class A common stock. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the New York Stock Exchange. We are not currently required to comply with the SEC rules that implement Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and are therefore not required to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for that purpose. As a public company, we may be required to provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting commencing with our second annual report on Form 10-K.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm is not required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control over financial reporting is documented, designed or operating. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations and could cause a decline in the price of our Class A common stock.\nOur business depends, in part, on sales to the public sector, and significant changes in the contracting or fiscal policies of the public sector could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe derive a portion of our revenue from sales of subscriptions to our platform and related services to federal, state, local and foreign governments, and we believe that the success and growth of our business will continue to depend in part on our successful procurement of government contracts. Factors that could impede our ability to maintain or increase the amount of revenue derived from government contracts, include:\n\u2022\nchanges in fiscal or contracting policies;\n\u2022\ndecreases in available government funding;\n\u2022\nchanges in government programs or applicable requirements;\n\u2022\nthe adoption of new laws or regulations or changes to existing laws or regulations; and\n\u2022\npotential delays or changes in the government appropriations or other funding authorization processes.\nThe occurrence of any of the foregoing could cause governments and governmental agencies to delay or refrain from purchasing subscriptions to our platform and related services in the future or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCertain of our results of operations and financial metrics may be difficult to predict as a result of seasonality.\nAlthough we have not historically experienced significant seasonality with respect to our revenue throughout the year, we have seen seasonality in our sales cycle as a large percentage of our customers make their purchases late in the fourth quarter of a given year and pay us in the first quarter of the subsequent year. We may be affected by seasonal trends in the future, particularly as our business matures. Such seasonality may result from a number of factors, including a slowdown in our customers\u2019 procurement process during certain times of the year, both domestically and internationally, and customers choosing to spend remaining budgets shortly before the end of their fiscal years. These effects may become more pronounced as we target larger organizations, and their larger budgets for sales of our platform. Additionally, this seasonality may be reflected to a much lesser extent, and sometimes may not be immediately apparent, in our revenue, due to the fact that we recognize subscription revenue over the term of the applicable subscription agreement. To the extent we experience this seasonality, it may cause fluctuations in our results of operations and financial metrics, and make forecasting our future results of operations and financial metrics more difficult.\nWe may require additional capital to support our operations or the growth of our business, and we cannot be certain that this capital will be available on reasonable terms when required, or at all.\nWe have funded our operations since inception primarily through equity financings and payments by our customers for use of our platform and services. We cannot be certain when or if our operations will generate sufficient cash to fund our ongoing operations or the growth of our business.\nIn the future, we may require additional capital to support such activities or to respond to other business opportunities, challenges, acquisitions, or unforeseen circumstances. Our ability to obtain additional financing, if and when required, will depend on investor and lender demand, our operating performance, the condition of the capital markets and other factors. We cannot be certain that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. If we raise additional funds through future issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock. Any debt financing that we may secure in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. If we were unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired.\nTaxing authorities may successfully assert that we should have collected or in the future should collect sales and use, value added or similar taxes, and we could be subject to liability with respect to past or future sales, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe do not collect sales and use, value added and similar taxes in all jurisdictions in which we have sales, based on our belief that such taxes are not applicable. Sales and use, value added and similar tax laws and rates vary greatly by jurisdiction. Certain jurisdictions in which we do not collect such taxes may assert that such taxes are applicable, which could result in tax assessments, penalties and interest, and we may be required to collect such taxes in the future. Such tax assessments, penalties and interest or future requirements may adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, the application of federal, state, local and international tax laws to solutions provided digitally are continuously evolving. Income, sales, use or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be enacted or amended at any time, possibly with retroactive effect, which could increase our taxes and ultimately result in a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows.\nOur ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, for federal, California and other state income tax purposes of approximately $231.8 million, $63.1 million and $88.8 million, respectively, which may be available to offset tax income in the future. In general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOLs to offset future taxable income. We have undergone ownership changes in the past, which has resulted in some limitations on our ability to utilize our NOLs, and if we undergo an ownership change, our ability to utilize NOLs could be further limited by Section 382 of the Code. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code. Furthermore, our ability to utilize NOLs of companies that we have acquired or may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations. There is also a risk that due to regulatory changes, such as suspensions on the use of NOLs or other unforeseen reasons, our existing NOLs could expire or otherwise be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities, including for state tax purposes. For these reasons, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of the NOLs reflected on our balance sheet, even if we attain profitability.\nWe may acquire or invest in companies, which may divert our management\u2019s attention and result in additional dilution to our stockholders. We may be unable to integrate acquired businesses and technologies successfully or achieve the expected benefits of such acquisitions.\nOur success will depend, in part, on our ability to expand our platform and services and grow our business in response to changing technologies, customer demands and competitive pressures. In some circumstances, we may choose to do so through the acquisition of complementary businesses and technologies rather than through internal development. The identification of suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult, time-consuming and costly, and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisitions. The risks we face in connection with acquisitions include:\n\u2022\nan acquisition may negatively affect our results of operations because it may require us to incur charges or assume substantial debt or other liabilities, may cause adverse tax consequences or unfavorable accounting treatment, may\nexpose us to claims and disputes by stockholders and third parties, including intellectual property claims and disputes, or may not generate sufficient financial return to offset additional costs and expenses related to the acquisition;\n\u2022\nwe may encounter difficulties or unforeseen expenditures in integrating the business, technologies, products, personnel or operations of any company that we acquire, particularly if key personnel of the acquired company decide not to work for us;\n\u2022\nan acquisition may disrupt our ongoing business, divert resources, increase our expenses and distract our management;\n\u2022\nan acquisition may result in a delay or reduction of customer purchases for both us and the company acquired due to customer uncertainty about continuity and effectiveness of service from either company;\n\u2022\nwe may encounter difficulties in, or may be unable to, successfully sell any acquired products;\n\u2022\nour use of cash to pay for acquisitions would limit other potential uses for our cash;\n\u2022\nif we incur debt to fund any acquisitions, such debt may subject us to material restrictions on our ability to conduct our business financial maintenance covenants; and\n\u2022\nif we issue a significant amount of equity securities in connection with future acquisitions, existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease.\nThe occurrence of any of these risks could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend and rely upon SaaS technologies from third parties to operate our business, and interruptions or performance problems with these technologies may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe rely on hosted SaaS applications from third parties in order to operate critical functions of our business, including enterprise resource planning, order management, billing, cybersecurity, project management, and accounting and reporting all financial activity. If these services become unavailable due to extended outages, interruptions or because they are no longer available on commercially reasonable terms, our expenses could increase, our ability to manage finances could be interrupted and our processes for managing sales of our platform and supporting our customers could be impaired until equivalent services, if available, are identified, obtained and implemented, all of which could adversely affect our business.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and our election to comply with the reduced disclosure requirements as a public company may make our Class A common stock less attractive to investors.\nFor so long as we remain an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d including not being required to comply with the independent auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until the earliest of (i) December 31, 2022 (ii) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenue is $1.07 billion or more, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous rolling three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt securities or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as defined in the Exchange Act. We cannot predict if investors will find our Class A common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our Class A common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our Class A common stock, and our stock price may be more volatile and may decline.\nIn addition, the JOBS Act also provides that an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. However, we have chosen to \u201copt out\u201d of such extended transition period, and as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.\nOur business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fire, floods and other natural catastrophic events, and to interruption by man-made problems such as power disruptions, computer viruses, data security breaches or terrorism.\nOur corporate headquarters are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity. A significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire or a flood, occurring at our headquarters, at one of our other facilities or where a business partner is located could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, if a natural disaster or man-made problem were to affect data centers used by AWS, this could adversely affect the ability of our customers to use our platform. In addition, natural disasters and acts of terrorism could cause disruptions in our or our customers\u2019 businesses, national economies or the world economy as a whole. We also rely on our network and third-party infrastructure and enterprise applications and internal technology systems for our engineering, sales and marketing and operations activities. Although we maintain incident management and disaster response plans, in the event of a major disruption caused by a natural disaster or man-made problem, we may be unable to continue our operations and may endure system interruptions, reputational harm, delays in our development activities, lengthy interruptions in service, breaches of data security and loss of critical data, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, computer malware, viruses and computer hacking, fraudulent use attempts and phishing attacks have become more prevalent in our industry, have occurred on our platform in the past and may occur on our platform in the future. Though it is difficult to determine what, if any, harm may directly result from any specific interruption or attack, any failure to maintain performance, reliability, security and availability of our platform and technical infrastructure to the satisfaction of our users may harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nThe dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with those stockholders who held our capital stock prior to the completion of our initial public offering, including our executive officers, employees and directors and their affiliates, which limits your ability to influence the outcome of important transactions, including a change in control.\nOur Class B common stock has 10 votes per share, and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. As of December 31, 2017, outstanding shares of Class B common stock represented approximately 84.7% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock, and outstanding shares of Class B common stock held by our directors, executive officers, and each of our stockholders who beneficially owns greater than 10% of our outstanding capital stock, and their affiliates, represented approximately 77.3% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Because of the 10-to-1 voting ratio between our Class B common stock and Class A common stock, the holders of our Class B common stock will collectively continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our capital stock and therefore will be able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval even when the shares of Class B common stock represent a small minority of all outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock. These holders of our Class B common stock may also have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. This concentrated control may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of our company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their capital stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nFuture transfers by holders of our Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting into shares of our Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for tax or estate planning purposes. The conversion of shares of our Class B common stock into shares of our Class A common stock will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long term. If, for example, Messrs. Schott and Mason retain a significant portion of their holdings of our Class B common stock for an extended period of time, they could control a significant portion of the voting power of our capital stock for the foreseeable future. As a board member, Mr. Schott owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders. As stockholders, Messrs. Schott and Mason are entitled to vote their shares in their own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock could be volatile, which could cause the value of your investment to decline.\nTechnology stocks have historically experienced high levels of volatility. The trading price of our Class A common stock has fluctuated since our initial public offering and may fluctuate substantially in the future depending on many factors, some of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our Class A common stock include the following:\n\u2022\nannouncements of new products or technologies, commercial relationships, acquisitions or other events by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in how customers perceive the benefits of our platform;\n\u2022\ndepartures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the trading volume of our shares or the size of our public float;\n\u2022\nsales of large blocks of our Class A common stock;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes or fluctuations in our results of operations;\n\u2022\nwhether our results of operations meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors;\n\u2022\nchanges in actual or future expectations of investors or securities analysts;\n\u2022\nlitigation involving us, our industry, or both;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments in the United States, foreign countries or both;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and trends;\n\u2022\nmajor catastrophic events in our domestic and foreign markets; and\n\u2022\n\u201cflash crashes,\u201d \u201cfreeze flashes\u201d or other glitches that disrupt trading on the securities exchange on which we are listed.\nIn addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, results of operations or financial condition. The trading price of our Class A common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us. In the past, following periods of volatility in the trading price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. If our stock price is volatile, we may become the target of securities litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources from our business. This could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf securities analysts or industry analysts were to downgrade our stock, publish negative research or reports or fail to publish reports about our business, our competitive position could suffer, and our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock will, to some extent, depend on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us should downgrade our stock or publish negative research or reports, cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports about our business, our competitive position could suffer, and our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nSales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock in the public markets, or the perception that such sales could occur, could reduce the price that our Class A common stock might otherwise attain.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock in the public market in the near future, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock and may make it more difficult for you to sell your Class A common stock at a time and price that you deem appropriate. As of December 31, 2017, we had 131,337,767 shares of capital stock outstanding, all of which are freely tradable, unless such shares are held by \u201caffiliates,\u201d as that term is defined in Rule 144 of the Securities Act.\nAs of December 31, 2017, a significant portion of our outstanding capital stock have rights, subject to certain conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering the sale of their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders. We have also registered the offer and sale of all shares of capital stock that we may issue under our equity compensation plans. As a result, subject to the satisfaction of applicable vesting periods, the shares of our capital stock issued upon exercise or settlement of outstanding equity awards under our equity compensation plans will be available for immediate resale in the United States in the open market.\nOur issuance of additional capital stock in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, our stock incentive plans or otherwise will dilute all other stockholders.\nWe expect to issue additional capital stock in the future that will result in dilution to all other stockholders. We expect to grant equity awards to employees, directors and consultants under our stock incentive plans. We may also raise capital through equity financings in the future. As part of our business strategy, we may acquire or make investments in complementary companies, products or technologies and issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition or investment. Any such issuances of additional\ncapital stock may cause stockholders to experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the per share value of our Class A common stock to decline.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our Class A common stock and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our Class A common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any dividends on our capital stock. We intend to retain any earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, you may only receive a return on your investment in our Class A common stock if the market price of our Class A common stock increases.\nDelaware law and our corporate charter and bylaws contain anti-takeover provisions that could delay or discourage takeover attempts that stockholders may consider favorable.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company. These provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to elect directors who are not nominated by the current members of our board of directors or take other corporate actions, including effecting changes in our management. These provisions include:\n\u2022\na classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which could delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n\u2022\nthe exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022\na prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by our board of directors, the chairperson of our board of directors, our Chief Executive Officer or our President (in the absence of a Chief Executive Officer), which could delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\n\u2022\nthe requirement for the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of the voting stock, voting together as a single class, to amend the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to the management of our business (including our classified board structure) or certain provisions of our amended and restated bylaws, which may inhibit the ability of an acquirer to effect such amendments to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to amend the bylaws, which may allow our board of directors to take additional actions to prevent an unsolicited takeover and inhibit the ability of an acquirer to amend the bylaws to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures with which stockholders must comply to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us; and\n\u2022\nthe authorization of two classes of common stock, as discussed above.\nIn addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a specified period of time.", "PERMNO": 16614, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "MULE"}
