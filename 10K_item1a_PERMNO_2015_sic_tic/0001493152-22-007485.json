RISK FACTORS\nWe are subject to various risks that may materially harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. An investment in our common stock is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. In evaluating an investment in our common stock, you should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the other information included in this Form 10-K, including the consolidated financial statements and related notes.\nYou should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties facing our business. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. If any of the events described in the following risk factors actually occurs, or if additional risks and uncertainties later materialize, that are not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial, then our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment in our shares. The risks discussed below include forward-looking statements, and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as employment relations, general economic conditions and geopolitical events. Further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may in the future materially and adversely affect our business, operations, liquidity and stock price.\nRisk Factor Summary\nBelow is a summary of the principal factors that make an investment in our common stock speculative or risky. This summary does not address all of the risks that we face. Additional discussion of the risks summarized in this risk factor summary, and other risks that we face, can be found below under the heading \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and should be carefully considered, together with other information in this Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC, before making an investment decision regarding our common stock.\nRisks Associated With Our Business:\n\u25cf We have operated at a loss and will likely continue to operate at a loss for the foreseeable future.\n\u25cf Because we have no source of significant recurring revenue, we must depend on capital raising to sustain our operations, and our ability to raise capital may be severely limited.\n\u25cf If Orphazyme fails to successfully develop and commercialize arimoclomol, our business prospects will be materially adversely affected.\n\u25cf If ImmunityBio fails to successfully develop aldoxorubicin or our exclusive licensing arrangement with ImmunityBio is otherwise unsuccessful, our business prospects will be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Associated With Drug Discovery and Development:\n\u25cf If the projected development goals for our product candidates are not achieved in the expected time frames, the commercialization of our products may be delayed and our business prospects may suffer. Our financial projections also may prove to be materially inaccurate.\n\u25cf The regulatory approval process is lengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable, and if our products or those we have sold or licensed are not successfully developed and approved by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, we may be forced to reduce or curtail our operations.\n\u25cf Clinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results.\n\u25cf We may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights, which could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively.\n\u25cf If our product candidates infringe the rights of others, we could be subject to expensive litigation or be required to obtain licenses from others to develop or market them.\n\u25cf The results of pre-clinical studies or early clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, and our ultra-high potency albumin-binding drug conjugates may not have favorable results in later clinical trials or receive regulatory approval.\n\u25cf Any products that we develop or are sold or licensed may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations or third-party coverage and reimbursement policies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\u25cf Healthcare legislative reform measures could hinder or prevent the commercial success of our products and product candidates.\n\u25cf We may also be subject to healthcare laws, regulation and enforcement and our failure to comply with those laws could adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition.\n\u25cf We will be required to pay substantial milestone and other payments relating to the commercialization of our products.\n\u25cf The COVID-19 pandemic could adversely impact our business and prospects, including active and planned clinical trials by ImmunityBio and Orphazyme.\n\u25cf In the event of a dispute regarding our international drug development, it may be necessary for us to resolve the dispute in the foreign country of dispute, where we would be faced with unfamiliar laws and procedures.\n\u25cf Drug discovery is a complex, time-consuming and expensive process, and we may not succeed in creating new product candidates.\n\u25cf We have a limited operating history in drug discovery, which is inherently risky, and we may not succeed in addressing these risks.\nGeneral Risk Factors:\n\u25cf We are subject to intense competition, and we may not compete successfully.\n\u25cf We are subject to potential liabilities from clinical testing and future product liability claims.\n\u25cf We may be unable to successfully acquire additional technologies or products. If we require additional technologies or products, our product development plans may change and the ownership interests of our shareholders could be diluted.\n\u25cf The impact and results of our exploration of any strategic alternatives are uncertain and may not be successful.\n\u25cf We rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology, including any cybersecurity incidents, could harm our ability to operate our business effectively.\n\u25cf Our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster.\n\u25cf You may experience future dilution as a result of future equity offerings or other equity issuances.\n\u25cf Our outstanding options and warrants and the availability for resale of the underlying shares may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\n\u25cf We cannot assure investors that our internal controls will prevent future material weaknesses.\n\u25cf We could be subject to legal actions that could adversely affect our financial condition.\n\u25cf Our anti-takeover measures may make it more difficult to change our management, or may discourage others from acquiring us, and thereby adversely affect stockholder value.\n\u25cf Our restated by-laws, as amended, designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.\n\u25cf We may issue preferred stock in the future, and the terms of the preferred stock may reduce the value of our common stock.\n\u25cf We do not expect to pay any cash dividends on our common stock.\nRisks Associated With Our Business\nWe have operated at a loss and will likely continue to operate at a loss for the foreseeable future.\nWe have operated at a loss due to our ongoing expenditures for research and development of our product candidates and for general and administrative purposes, and lack of significant recurring revenues. We incurred a net loss of $13.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and had an accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2021 of $483.9 million. We are likely to continue to incur losses unless and until we are able to earn milestones and royalties from our existing licensing and sale agreements and/or conclude a successful strategic partnership or financing for our LADR\u2122 technology. These losses, among other things, have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our product development efforts, we are unable to predict when we may become profitable, if at all. If we do not become profitable or are unable to maintain future profitability, the market value of our common stock will be adversely affected. These factors individually and collectively raise a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph in its report as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 expressing substantial doubt in our ability to continue as a going concern based on our recurring and continuing losses from operations and our need for additional funding to continue operations. Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this going concern uncertainty and have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue to operate as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, we may be forced to liquidate our assets which would have an adverse impact on our business and developmental activities. In such a scenario, the values we receive for our assets in liquidation or dissolution could be significantly lower than the values reflected in our financial statements. The reaction of investors to the inclusion of a going concern statement by our independent registered public accounting firm and our potential inability to continue as a going concern may materially adversely affect our stock price and our ability to raise new capital or to enter into strategic alliances.\nBecause we have no source of significant recurring revenue, we must depend on capital raising to sustain our operations, and our ability to raise capital may be severely limited.\nDeveloping products and conducting clinical trials require substantial amounts of capital. In July 2021, we were able raise some capital through the sale of common stock registered under our \u201cshelf\u201d registration on Form S-3, as well as through the related private placement of certain warrants and the preferred investment option. We will likely need to raise additional capital to fund our general and administrative expenses and, if we determine to develop products based on Centurion\u2019s LADR\u2122 technology platform, we will need to raise additional capital to fund development of product candidates, prepare, file, prosecute, maintain, enforce and defend patent and other proprietary rights, and develop and implement sales, marketing and distribution capabilities. However, we have no available authorized common shares to issue, making capital raising significantly more challenging.\nAt December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $6.8 million. Management believes that our current resources will be sufficient to fund our operations through December 31, 2022. This estimate is based, in part, upon our currently projected expenditures for 2022 and the first three months of 2023 of approximately $6.5 million (unaudited) to fund our operating activities. These projected expenditures are also based upon numerous other assumptions and subject to many uncertainties, and actual expenditures may be significantly different from these projections. We will ultimately be required to obtain additional funding in order to execute our long-term business plans, although we do not currently have commitments from any third parties to provide us with long term debt or capital. We cannot assure that additional funding will be available on favorable terms, or at all. If we fail to obtain additional funding when needed, we may not be able to execute our business plans and our business may suffer, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, dilution to stockholders may result and new investors could have rights superior to current equity holders. In addition, debt financing, if available, may include restrictive covenants. If adequate funds are not available to us, we may have to liquidate some or all of our assets or delay or reduce the scope of or eliminate some portion or all of our development programs. We also may have to license to other companies our product candidates or technologies that we would prefer to develop and commercialize ourselves.\nOn March 15, 2022, CytRx Corporation (the \u201cCompany\u201d) held a special meeting of stockholders (the \u201cSpecial Meeting\u201d), which was originally opened and subsequently adjourned on September 23, 2021, at which meeting the Company\u2019s stockholders, by an affirmative vote of the majority of the Company\u2019s outstanding shares of capital stock, approved the amendment to the Company\u2019s Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the \u201cCertificate of Incorporation\u201d) to effect an increase in the number of shares of authorized common stock, par value $0.001 per share, from 41,666,666 shares to 62,393,940 shares, and to make a corresponding change to the number of authorized shares of capital stock in order to comply with the Company\u2019s contractual obligations under a securities purchase agreement entered into on July 13, 2021 (the \u201cAuthorized Share Increase Amendment\u201d). The number of shares of authorized preferred stock of the Company remains unchanged.\nOn March 15, 2022, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the\u201dCertificate of Amendment\u201d) with the Secretary of State of Delaware to effect the Authorized Share Increase Amendment.\nAs of March 23, 2022, we have no additional shares of common stock that are authorized and unissued. We would need approval of our stockholders to increase our authorized shares of our common stock in order to raise additional capital in excess of this amount of shares.\nIf Orphazyme fails to successfully develop and commercialize arimoclomol, our business prospects will be materially adversely affected.\nIn 2011, CytRx sold the rights to arimoclomol and iroxanadine, based on molecular chaperone regulation technology, to Orphazyme in exchange for a one-time, upfront payment and the right to receive up to a total of $120 million in milestone payments upon the achievement of certain pre-specified regulatory and business milestones, as well as single- and double-digit royalty payments based on a specified percentage of any net sales of products derived from arimoclomol. Orphazyme announced in March and May of 2021 that pivotal phase 3 clinical trials assessing the safety and efficacy of arimoclomol in treating ALS and IBM, respectively, did not meet their primary or secondary endpoints and that it has ceased development of, and its pursuit of regulatory approvals for, arimoclomol for such indications. As a result, the maximum amount that we are eligible to receive in future milestone payments under the agreement with Orphazyme is now approximately $100 million. There can be no assurance that said amount or any portion thereof will be realized, as such realization is contingent upon certain regulatory approvals of arimoclomol for indications other than the prevention or treatment of ALS or stroke and other contingencies over which we have no control. Orphazyme is testing arimoclomol in NPC and Gaucher disease. On June 18, 2021, Orphazyme announced it received a CRL from the FDA, identifying certain deficiencies in the NDA that precluded its approval. In particular, Orphazyme announced that the CRL was issued based on the need for additional confirmatory evidence, as well as additional qualitative and quantitative evidence to further substantiate the validity of the 5-domain NPC Clinical Severity Scale (\u201cNPCCSS\u201d), specifically the swallow domain, in the context of a lack of significant findings when using the FDA\u2019s preferred and recommended statistical approach. In late October 2021, Orphazyme announced it held a Type A meeting with the FDA where the FDA recommended that Orphazyme submit additional data, information and analyses to address certain topics in the CRL and engage in further interactions with the FDA to identify a pathway to resubmission. The FDA concurred with Orphazyme\u2019s proposal to remove the cognition domain from the NPCCSS endpoint, with the result that the primary endpoint is permitted to be recalculated using the 4- domain NPCCSS, subject to the submission of additional requested information which Orphazyme intends to provide. The FDA also affirmed that it would require additional in vivo or pharmacodynamic (PD)/pharmacokinetic (PK) data. Orphazyme is planning to request a Type C Meeting with the FDA in the second quarter of 2022 to discuss its progress in redressing the deficiencies identified in the CRL and plans for resubmission. Subject to FDA\u2019s feedback in the Type C meeting and any other pertinent discussions with the regulatory body, Orphazyme plans to resubmit the NDA for arimoclomol in the second half of 2022. However, there are a number of uncertainties inherent in clinical investigation that may hinder Orphazyme\u2019s plans for generating additional data, meeting with FDA, and/or resubmitting the NDA. And, even if Orphazyme properly implements FDA\u2019s feedback and resubmits the NDA with the additional confirmatory evidence and qualitative and quantitative data that FDA requested, there is no guarantee that FDA will approve the resubmitted version of the NDA.\nOrphazyme has also submitted a MAA with the EMA. In February 2022, Orphazyme announced that they were notified by the CHMP of a negative trend vote on the MAA for arimoclomol in NPC following an oral explanation. The trend vote indicates that the CHMP\u2019s current orientation is to not approve arimoclomol when it convenes by the end of March 2022. Orphazyme considers it unlikely that this position will change before the formal vote is undertaken in March 2022. They will assess their strategic options and provide an update to the market at the applicable time\nThe potential revenue from our arrangement with Orphazyme is based on contingent payments, which will depend upon Orphazyme\u2019s ability to achieve regulatory approvals and successfully market and sell products derived from arimoclomol. Our ability to realize the maximum amount of aggregate milestone payments initially set forth in our agreement with Orphazyme has been reduced by approximately $20 million due to Orphazyme\u2019s unsuccessful pivotal studies of arimoclomol for ALS and IBM and subsequent decision to cease arimoclomol\u2019s development with regard such indications. While Orphazyme has progressed further in connection with its development of arimoclomol for NPC (than for ALS or IBM), its efforts to obtain the FDA and EMA approvals needed to lawfully market arimoclomol for NPC in the United States and the EU, respectively, have been unsuccessful thus far and may never succeed. We will not be involved in this process and will depend entirely on Orphazyme, which may fail to develop or effectively commercialize products derived from arimoclomol for many reasons, including if they:\n\u25cf decide not to devote the necessary resources due to internal constraints, such as limited personnel with the requisite scientific expertise, limited cash resources or specialized equipment limitations, or the belief that other drug development programs may have a higher likelihood of obtaining regulatory approval or may potentially generate a greater return on investment;\n\u25cf do not have sufficient resources necessary to carry arimoclomol through clinical development, regulatory approval and commercialization;\n\u25cf cannot obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for arimoclomol; or\n\u25cf decide to pursue a competitive drug candidate.\nIf Orphazyme does not obtain the regulatory approvals for arimoclomol that are necessary to trigger the corresponding milestone payments to us under our agreement, or if their research and development or commercialization efforts are, otherwise, unsuccessful, we will not realize the anticipated commercial benefits of the arrangement and our business prospects will be materially and adversely affected.\nIf ImmunityBio fails to successfully develop aldoxorubicin or our exclusive licensing arrangement with ImmunityBio is otherwise unsuccessful, our business prospects will be materially and adversely affected.\nIn July 2017, we entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with ImmunityBio to complete the clinical development of and commercialization of aldoxorubicin. Under this agreement, ImmunityBio has committed to provide substantial funding, as well as significant capabilities in clinical development, regulatory affairs, marketing and sales.\nIf, for any reason, ImmunityBio does not devote sufficient time and resources to the development and commercialization of aldoxorubicin, we will not realize the potential commercial benefits of the arrangement, and our results of operations will be adversely affected. In addition, if ImmunityBio were to breach or terminate its arrangement with us, the development and commercialization of aldoxorubicin could be delayed, curtailed or terminated, and we may not have sufficient financial resources or capabilities to continue development and commercialization of aldoxorubicin on our own.\nUnder our agreement with ImmunityBio, they may opt out of a project by giving us twelve months\u2019 prior written notice. If ImmunityBio were to exercise its right to opt out of a program or to terminate the licensing agreement, the development and commercialization of aldoxorubicin would be adversely affected, our potential for generating revenue from this program would be adversely affected and attracting new partners would be made more difficult.\nMuch of the potential revenue from our existing and future arrangement with ImmunityBio will consist of contingent payments, such as payments for achieving development and commercialization milestones and single- and double-digit royalties payable on commercial sales of successfully developed aldoxorubicin. The milestone, royalty and other revenue that we may receive under this arrangement will depend upon our, and ImmunityBio\u2019s ability to successfully develop, introduce, market, commercialize and sell aldoxorubicin. We will not be directly involved in this process and will depend entirely on ImmunityBio, which may fail to develop or effectively commercialize aldoxorubicin for many reasons including if they:\n\u25cf decide not to devote the necessary resources due to internal constraints, such as limited personnel with the requisite scientific expertise, limited cash resources or specialized equipment limitations, or the belief that other drug development programs may have a higher likelihood of obtaining regulatory approval or may potentially generate a greater return on investment;\n\u25cf do not have sufficient resources necessary to carry aldoxorubicin through clinical development, regulatory approval and commercialization;\n\u25cf cannot obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for aldoxorubicin; or\n\u25cf decide to pursue a competitive drug candidate.\nIf ImmunityBio fails to develop or effectively commercialize aldoxorubicin or for any of the other reasons described above, we may not be able to develop and commercialize that drug independently or replace ImmunityBio with another suitable partner in a reasonable period of time and on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nRisks Associated With Drug Discovery and Development\nIf the projected development goals for our product candidates are not achieved in the expected time frames, the commercialization of our products may be delayed and our business prospects may suffer. Our financial projections also may prove to be materially inaccurate.\nFrom time to time, we estimate the timing of the accomplishment of various scientific, clinical, regulatory and other product development goals, which we sometimes refer to as milestones. These milestones may include the commencement or completion of scientific studies and clinical trials and the submission of regulatory filings.\nWe also may disclose projected expenditures or other forecasts for future periods. These and other financial projections are based on management\u2019s current expectations and do not contain any margin of error or cushion for any specific uncertainties, or for the uncertainties inherent in all financial forecasting.\nThe actual timing of milestones and actual expenditures or other financial results can vary dramatically compared to our estimates, in some cases for reasons beyond our control or the control of companies that have licensed or purchased our product candidates. If these milestones or financial projections are not met, the development and commercialization of our product candidates may be delayed and our business prospects may suffer. The assumptions management has used to produce these projections may significantly change or prove to be inaccurate. Accordingly, you should not unduly rely on any of these financial projections.\nThe regulatory approval process is lengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable, and if our products or those we have sold or licensed are not successfully developed and approved by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, we may be forced to reduce or curtail our operations.\nAll of our product candidates in development or those licensed or sold must be approved by the FDA or corresponding foreign governmental agencies before they can be marketed. The process for obtaining FDA and foreign government approvals is both time-consuming and costly, with no certainty of a successful outcome. This process typically includes the conduct of extensive pre-clinical and clinical testing, including post-approval testing, which may take longer or cost more than we or our licensees, if any, anticipate, and may prove unsuccessful due to numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. In addition, approval policies, regulations, or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate\u2019s clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions. None of our product candidates in development or licensed or sold to third parties have received regulatory approval.\nNumerous factors could affect the timing, cost or outcome of product development efforts, including the following:\n\u25cf difficulty in enrolling patients in conformity with required protocols or projected timelines;\n\u25cf requirements for clinical trial design imposed by the FDA;\n\u25cf unexpected adverse reactions by patients in trials;\n\u25cf difficulty in obtaining clinical supplies of the product;\n\u25cf changes in or our inability to comply with FDA or foreign governmental product testing, manufacturing or marketing requirements;\n\u25cf regulatory inspections of clinical trials or manufacturing facilities, which may, among other things, require us or our manufacturers or licensees to undertake corrective action or suspend or terminate the affected clinical trials if investigators find them not to be in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf inability to generate statistically significant data confirming the safety and efficacy of the product being tested;\n\u25cf modification of the product during testing; and\n\u25cf reallocation of our limited financial and other resources to other clinical programs.\nIt is possible that none of the product candidates we develop or have sold or licensed will obtain the regulatory approvals necessary for us to begin selling them or making us eligible to receive milestone or royalty payments. The time required to obtain FDA and foreign governmental approvals is unpredictable, but often can take years following the commencement of clinical trials, depending upon the complexity of the product candidate. Any analysis performed on data from clinical activities is subject to confirmation and interpretation by regulatory authorities, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. In addition, even if regulatory approval was obtained, regulatory authorities may approve any product candidates for fewer or more limited indications than requested, may not approve the intended price for such products, may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials, or may approve a product candidate with a label that does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of that product candidate. Any of the foregoing scenarios could materially harm the commercial prospects for the product candidates that we develop, have sold or licensed.\nFurthermore, even if regulatory approvals are obtained, the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, import, export, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping for the product will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration, as well as continued compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, and good clinical practices, or cGCPs, for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:\n\u25cf restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, withdrawal of the product from the market, or voluntary or mandatory product recalls;\n\u25cf fines, warning letters or holds on clinical trials;\n\u25cf refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us or our strategic partners, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;\n\u25cf product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; and\n\u25cf injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nThe FDA\u2019s policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business. We will also be subject to periodic inspections and the potential for mandatory post- approval clinical trials required by the FDA and other U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities. Any delay or failure in obtaining required approvals or to comply with post-approval regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue from the particular product candidate. The failure to comply with any post-approval regulatory requirements also could result in the rescission of the related regulatory approvals or the suspension of sales of the offending product.\nClinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results.\nClinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. The results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials of our product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials. For example, aldoxorubicin has shown encouraging preliminary clinical results in our Phase 2b clinical trial as a treatment for STS. These conclusions may not be reproduced in future clinical trial results. For instance, the Phase 3 pivotal clinical trial testing aldoxorubicin as a treatment for STS narrowly missed statistical significance although it demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS over investigator\u2019s choice in 312 patients treated in North America and Australia. Accordingly, our development partner may ultimately be unable to provide the FDA and/or other U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities with satisfactory data on clinical safety and efficacy sufficient to obtain approval from the FDA of aldoxorubicin for any indication.\nFurther delays may occur in clinical trials of product candidates. We do not know whether ongoing clinical trials will be completed on schedule or at all, or whether planned clinical trials will begin on time, need to be redesigned, enroll patients on time or be completed on schedule, if at all. Clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including delays related to:\n\u25cf obtaining regulatory approval to commence a trial;\n\u25cf reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and clinical trial sites;\n\u25cf obtaining institutional review board approval at each clinical trial site;\n\u25cf recruiting suitable patients to participate in a trial;\n\u25cf having patients complete a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u25cf clinical trial sites deviating from trial protocol or dropping out of a trial;\n\u25cf adding new clinical trial sites; or\n\u25cf manufacturing sufficient quantities of product candidate for use in clinical trials.\nWe may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights, which could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively.\nWe will be able to protect our technologies from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that we have rights to valid and enforceable patents or other proprietary rights that cover them. Although we have rights to patents and patent applications directed to our product candidates, these patents and applications may not prevent third parties from developing or commercializing similar or identical technologies. In addition, our patents may be held to be invalid if challenged by third parties, and our patent applications may not result in the issuance of patents.\nThe patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology patents has emerged to date in the United States and in many foreign countries. The application and enforcement of patent laws and regulations in foreign countries is even more uncertain. Accordingly, we may not be able to effectively file, protect or defend our proprietary rights on a consistent basis. Many of the patents and patent applications on which we rely were issued or filed by third parties prior to the time we acquired rights to them. The validity, enforceability and ownership of those patents and patent applications may be challenged, and if a court decides that our patents are not valid, we will not have the right to stop others from using our inventions. There is also the risk that, even if the validity of our patents is upheld, a court may refuse to stop others on the ground that their activities do not infringe our patents.\nAny litigation brought by us to protect our intellectual property rights could be costly and have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition, make it more difficult for us to enter into strategic alliances with third parties to develop our products, or discourage our existing licensees from continuing their development work on our potential products. If our patent coverage is insufficient to prevent third parties from developing or commercializing similar or identical technologies, the value of our assets is likely to be materially and adversely affected.\nWe also rely on certain proprietary trade secrets and know-how, especially where we believe patent protection is not appropriate or obtainable. Trade secrets and know-how are difficult to protect. Although we have taken measures to protect our unpatented trade secrets and know-how, including the use of confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants and some of our contractors, it is possible that these persons may disclose our trade secrets or know-how or that our competitors may independently develop or otherwise discover our trade secrets and know-how.\nIf our product candidates infringe the rights of others, we could be subject to expensive litigation or be required to obtain licenses from others to develop or market them.\nOur competitors or others may have patent rights that they choose to assert against us or our licensees, suppliers, customers or potential collaborators. Moreover, we may not know about patents or patent applications that our products would infringe. For example, because patent applications do not publish for at least 18 months, if at all, and can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications unknown to us that may later result in issued patents that our product candidates would infringe. In addition, if third parties file patent applications or obtain patents claiming technology also claimed by us or our licensors in issued patents or pending applications, we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to determine priority of invention. If third parties file oppositions in foreign countries, we may also have to participate in opposition proceedings in foreign tribunals to defend the patentability of our foreign patent applications.\nIf a third-party claims that we are infringing on its proprietary rights, any of the following may occur:\n\u25cf we may become involved in time-consuming and expensive litigation, even if the claim is without merit;\n\u25cf we may become liable for substantial damages for past infringement if a court decides that our technology infringes a competitor\u2019s patent;\n\u25cf a court may prohibit us from selling or licensing our product without a license from the patent holder, which may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all, or which may require us to pay substantial royalties or grant cross licenses to our patents; and\n\u25cf we may have to redesign our product candidates or technology so that it does not infringe patent rights of others, which may not be possible or commercially feasible.\nIf any of these events occurs, our business and prospects will suffer and the market price of our common stock will likely decline substantially.\nThe results of pre-clinical studies or early clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, and our ultra-high potency albumin-binding drug conjugates may not have favorable results in later clinical trials or receive regulatory approval.\nSuccess in pre-clinical studies and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will generate adequate data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of our ultra-high potency albumin-binding drug conjugates. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including those with greater resources and experience than we have, have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials, even after seeing promising results in earlier clinical trials. We do not know whether the clinical trials we may conduct will demonstrate adequate efficacy and safety to result in regulatory approval to market them in any particular jurisdiction. If our clinical trials do not produce favorable results, our ability to achieve regulatory approval for these drug candidates will be adversely impacted and the value of our stock may decline.\nThe successful commercialization of our product candidates that are approved for marketing in the United States, if any, and/or any other products that we or our partners may commercialize in the future will likely depend, in-part, on the coverage and reimbursement policies of third-party payors, which, if unfavorable, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe commercial success of our product candidates that are approved for marketing in the United States, if any, as well as any other products that we may or our partners may commercialize in the future, may depend, in significant part, on the extent to such products will be covered and reimbursed by third-party payors, including government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, private insurers, and managed care organizations. Patients for whom prescription drugs are prescribed and prescribing practitioners generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Without adequate coverage and reimbursement, patients and providers are unlikely to use or prescribe any products that we or our partners may commercialize or from which we may, otherwise, generate revenue in connection with commercial sales.\nThere is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. In the United States, there is no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement. Accordingly, third-party payors, including private insurers and governmental payors, such as Medicare and Medicaid, play an important role in determining the extent to which new drugs and biologics will be covered and reimbursed. The Medicare program covers certain individuals aged 65 or older, as well as certain people under 65 with disabilities and individuals suffering from end-stage renal disease. The Medicaid program, which varies from state-to-state, covers eligible individuals and families who have limited financial means. The Medicare and Medicaid programs are increasingly used as models for how private payors and other governmental payors develop their coverage and reimbursement policies for drugs and biologics. It is difficult to predict at this time what third-party payors will decide with respect to the coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates and any other products we or our partners may commercialize or to which we may have commercialization rights or interests.\nThird-party payors may deny coverage or reimbursement if they determine that a medical product was not used in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods, as determined by the third-party payor, and most, if not all, payors will deny coverage for products used or administered for an unapproved indication. Third-party payors also typically refuse to cover and reimburse for experimental procedures and devices. Furthermore, third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. And, the U.S. government and state legislatures have shown significant interest in implementing healthcare cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement, discount and rebate requirements, and requirements for substitution of generic products. Such measures, and the enactment of any more restrictive updates thereto and/or new measures could further limit our potential profitability and commercial success in connection with any products we or our partners may market in the United States. We cannot predict whether, or the extent to which, government and/or private payors will cover any products we or our partners may commercialize in the future, and there can be no assurances that such coverage and reimbursement levels, as applicable, will be sufficient to allow us to profit from the commercial sale of such product(s) in light of our costs from development and other related activities and any current or future arrangements with our development and/or commercialization partners.\nAny products that we develop or are sold or licensed may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations and/or third-party coverage and reimbursement policies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur product candidates are intended to be marketed primarily to hospitals, which generally receive reimbursement for the health care services they provide to their patients from third-party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid and other domestic and international government programs, private insurance plans and managed care programs.\nSuch drugs will likely need to be administered under the supervision of a physician. Under currently applicable law, drugs that are not usually self-administered may be eligible for coverage by the Medicare program if:\n\u25cf they are \u201cincidental\u201d to a physician\u2019s services;\n\u25cf they are \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d for the diagnosis or treatment of the illness or injury for which they are administered according to accepted standard of medical practice;\n\u25cf they are not excluded as immunizations; and\n\u25cf they have been approved by the FDA.\nThere is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. In the United States, third-party payors, including private and governmental payors, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, play an important role in determining the extent to which new drugs and biologics will be covered and reimbursed. The Medicare program covers certain individuals aged 65 or older, disabled or suffering from end-stage renal disease. The Medicaid program, which varies from state-to-state, covers certain individuals and families who have limited financial means. The Medicare and Medicaid programs increasingly are used as models for how private payors and other governmental payors develop their coverage and reimbursement policies for drugs and biologics. It is difficult to predict at this time what third-party payors will decide with respect to the coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates.\nMost third-party payors may deny coverage or reimbursement if they determine that a medical product was not used in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods, as determined by the third-party payor, or was used for an unapproved indication. Third-party payors also may refuse to cover and reimburse for experimental procedures and devices. Furthermore, because our programs are in the early stages of development, we are unable at this time to determine their cost-effectiveness and the level or method of reimbursement. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices, and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. If the price we are able to charge for any products we develop is inadequate in light of our development and other costs, our profitability could be adversely affected.\nHealthcare legislative reform measures could hinder or prevent the commercial success of our products and product candidates.\nIn the United States, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future revenues and profitability. Federal and state lawmakers regularly propose and, at times, enact legislation that results in significant changes to the healthcare system, some of which are intended to contain or reduce the costs of medical products and services. For example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the \u201cACA\u201d), as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the \u201cHealthcare Reform Law,\u201d became law in the United States. It contains a number of provisions regarding health insurance, the provision of healthcare, conditions to reimbursement for healthcare services provided to Medicare and Medicaid patients, and other healthcare policy reforms. Through the law-making process, substantial changes have been and continue to be made to the current system for paying for healthcare in the United States, including changes made to extend medical benefits to certain Americans who lacked insurance coverage and to contain or reduce healthcare costs (such as by reducing or conditioning reimbursement amounts for healthcare services and drugs, and imposing additional taxes, fees, and rebate obligations on pharmaceutical and medical device companies). This legislation was one of the most comprehensive and significant reforms ever experienced by the United States in the healthcare industry and has significantly changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. This legislation has impacted the scope of healthcare insurance and incentives for consumers and insurance companies, among others. Additionally, the Healthcare Reform Law\u2019s provisions were designed to encourage providers to find cost savings in their clinical operations. Pharmaceuticals represent a significant portion of the cost of providing care. This environment has caused changes in the purchasing habits of consumers and providers and resulted in specific attention to the pricing negotiation, product selection and utilization review surrounding pharmaceuticals. This attention may result in any products we may commercialize or promote in the future, and/or our therapeutic candidates, as applicable, being chosen less frequently or subject to substantially lowered pricing.\nThese structural changes could entail further modifications to the existing system of private payors and government programs (such as Medicare, Medicaid, and the State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program), creation of government-sponsored healthcare insurance sources, or some combination of both, as well as other changes. Restructuring the coverage of medical care in the U.S. could impact the reimbursement for prescribed drugs and pharmaceuticals, including our current commercial products, those we and our development or commercialization partners are currently developing or those that we may commercialize or promote in the future. If reimbursement for the products we currently commercialize or promote, any product we may commercialize or promote, or approved therapeutic candidates is substantially reduced or otherwise adversely affected in the future, or rebate obligations associated with them are substantially increased, it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFurther, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which have resulted in several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to prescription drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. In addition, the United States government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing drug cost containment programs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs to limit the growth of government paid health care costs. For example, the United States government has passed legislation requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide rebates and discounts to certain entities and governmental payors to participate in federal healthcare programs. Further, Congress and the current administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs, and the current administration recently released a \u201cBlueprint\u201d, or plan, to reduce the cost of drugs. The current administration\u2019s Blueprint contains certain measures that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is already working to implement. Individual states in the United States have also been increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.\nWe anticipate there will continue to be proposals by legislators at both the federal and state levels, regulators and commercial payers to reduce prescription drug costs while expanding individual healthcare benefits. Additional changes that may affect our business include those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes, fraud and abuse enforcement, and expansion of new programs, such as Medicare payment for performance initiatives. The ultimate implementation of any healthcare reform legislation and any new laws and regulations, and its impact on us, is impossible to predict. Any significant reforms made to the healthcare system in the United States, or in other jurisdictions, may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may also be subject to federal and state healthcare laws and regulations relating to our current and/or future operations, and our failure to comply with those laws could adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition.\nIf we obtain FDA approval for any of our product candidates and begin commercializing those products in the United States, our operations may be directly, or indirectly through our customers, subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act, and physician sunshine laws and regulations. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing, and education programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:\n\u25cf the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u25cf the federal False Claims Act, which prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false claims, or knowingly using false statements, to obtain payment from the federal government, and which may apply to entities that provide coding and billing advice to customers;\n\u25cf federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u25cf the federal physician sunshine requirements under the Affordable Care Act, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers, and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members;\n\u25cf the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information; and\n\u25cf state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. For instance, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or the CCPA, became effective on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used by requiring covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers (as that term is broadly defined) and provide such consumers new ways to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. Although there are limited exemptions for clinical trial data and the CCPA\u2019s implementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future, the CCPA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. Many similar privacy laws have been proposed at the federal level and in other states.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. In addition, the federal government has identified relationships between drug companies (and other medical-product manufacturers) and healthcare providers as particularly susceptible to fraud and abuse and, thus, our relationships may be subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny, particularly once we have one or more products on the U.S. market, if ever. Further, many of the applicable healthcare laws and regulations are subject to varying and/or evolving interpretations, which makes achieving and maintaining consistent compliance more difficult.\nAchieving and sustaining compliance with these laws may prove costly. In addition, any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, imprisonment, or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.\nWe will be required to pay substantial milestone and other payments relating to the commercialization of our products.\nAldoxorubicin\nThe agreement relating to our worldwide rights to aldoxorubicin provides for our payment of up to an aggregate of $7.5 million upon meeting specified clinical and regulatory milestones up to and including the product\u2019s second, final marketing approval. We also will be obliged to pay:\n\u25cf commercially reasonable royalties based on a percentage of net sales (as defined in the agreement);\n\u25cf a percentage of any non-royalty sub-licensing income (as defined in the agreement); and\n\u25cf milestones of $1,000,000 for each additional final marketing approval that we might obtain.\nArimoclomol\nThe agreement relating to our worldwide rights to arimoclomol provides for our payment of up to an aggregate of $3.65 million upon receipt of milestone payments from Orphayzme A/S.\nInnovive\nUnder the merger agreement by which we acquired Innovive, we agreed to pay the former Innovive stockholders a total of up to approximately $18.3 million of future earnout merger consideration, subject to our achievement of specified net sales under the Innovive license agreements. The earnout merger consideration, if any, will be payable in shares of our common stock, subject to specified conditions, or, at our election, in cash or by a combination of shares of our common stock and cash. Our common stock will be valued for purposes of any future earnout merger consideration based upon the trading price of our common stock at the time the earnout merger consideration is paid.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could adversely impact our business and prospects, including active and planned clinical trials by ImmunityBio and Orphazyme.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, was first identified in China and has surfaced in several regions across the world. In March 2020, the disease was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The COVID-19 pandemic has, from time to time, led to government-imposed quarantines, limitations on business activity and shelter-in-place mandates to mitigate or contain the virus, and has contributed to financial market volatility and uncertainty, significant disruptions in general commercial activity and the global economy.\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, the companies which we are working to develop and commercialize our products, ImmunityBio and Orphazyme, could be materially and adversely affected by the risks, or the public perception of the risks, related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which could cause delays in our potential timing of receipts of milestones and royalties within the disclosed time periods and expected costs. The disruptions to ImmunityBio and Orphazyme could include:\n\u25cf delays or difficulties in recruiting and enrolling new patients in their clinical trials;\n\u25cf delays or difficulties in clinical site initiation, including difficulties in recruiting clinical site investigators and clinical site staff;\n\u25cf diversion of healthcare resources away from the conduct of clinical trials, including the diversion of hospitals serving as their clinical trial sites and hospital staff supporting the conduct of their clinical trials;\n\u25cf interruption of key clinical trial activities, such as clinical trial site monitoring, due to limitations on travel imposed or recommended by federal or state governments, employers and others;\n\u25cf limitations in employee resources that would otherwise be focused on the conduct of their clinical trials, including because of sickness of employees or their families or the desire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of people;\n\u25cf interruption in global shipping that may affect the transport of clinical trial supplies and materials, such as investigational drug product used in their clinical trials;\n\u25cf delays in receiving approval from the FDA and local regulatory authorities to initiate their planned clinical trials;\n\u25cf changes in FDA and local regulation as part of a response to the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak which may change the ways in which clinical trials are conducted of discontinue clinical trials altogether;\n\u25cf delays in necessary interactions with regulators, ethics committees and other important agencies and contractors due to limitations in employee resources or forced furlough of government employees;\n\u25cf delay in the timing of other interactions with the FDA due to absenteeism by federal employees or by the diversion of their efforts and attention to approval of other therapeutics or other activities related to COVID-19; and\n\u25cf refusal of the FDA to accept data from clinical trials in affected geographies outside the United States.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our business and prospects will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the duration of the pandemic, new variants of the coronavirus, travel restrictions and social distancing in the United States and other countries, business closures or business disruptions and the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease.\nIn the event of a dispute regarding our international drug development, it may be necessary for us to resolve the dispute in the foreign country of dispute, where we would be faced with unfamiliar laws and procedures.\nThe resolution of disputes in foreign countries can be costly and time consuming, similar to the situation in the United States. In a foreign country, we face the additional burden of understanding unfamiliar laws and procedures. We may not be entitled to a jury trial, as we might be in the United States. Further, to litigate in any foreign country, we would be faced with the necessity of hiring lawyers and other professionals who are familiar with the foreign laws. For these reasons, we may incur unforeseen expenses if we are forced to resolve a dispute in a foreign country.\nDrug discovery is a complex, time-consuming and expensive process, and we may not succeed in creating new product candidates.\nConducting drug discovery and pre-clinical development of our albumin-binding technology is a complex and expensive process that will take many years. Accordingly, we cannot be sure whether or when our drug discovery and pre-clinical development activities will succeed in developing any new product candidates. In addition, any product candidates that we develop in pre-clinical testing may not demonstrate success in clinical trials required for marketing approval.\nAny deficiency in the design, implementation or oversight of our drug discovery and pre-clinical testing programs could cause us to incur significant additional costs, experience significant delays, prevent us from obtaining marketing approval for any product candidate that may result from these programs or abandon development of certain product candidates. If any of these risks materializes, it could harm our business and cause our stock price to decline.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe are subject to intense competition, and we may not compete successfully.\nMany companies, including large pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms with financial resources, research and development staffs, and facilities that may be substantially greater than those of ours or our strategic partners or licensees, are engaged in the research and development of pharmaceutical products that could compete with our potential products. To the extent that we seek to acquire, through license or otherwise, existing or potential new products, we will be competing with numerous other companies, many of which will have substantially greater financial resources and large acquisition staffs that may give those companies a competitive advantage over us in identifying and evaluating these drug acquisition opportunities. Any products that we acquire will be competing with products marketed by companies that in many cases will have substantially greater marketing resources than we have. The industry is characterized by rapid technological advances and competitors may develop their products more rapidly and such products may be more effective than those currently under development or that may be developed in the future by our strategic partners or licensees. Competitive products for a number of the disease indications that we have targeted are currently being marketed by other parties, and additional competitive products are under development and may also include products currently under development that we are not aware of or products that may be developed in the future.\nAs a result, these competitors may:\n\u25cf succeed in developing competitive products sooner than us or our strategic partners or licensees;\n\u25cf obtain FDA or foreign governmental approvals for their products before we can obtain approval of any of our products;\n\u25cf obtain patents that block or otherwise inhibit the development and commercialization of our product candidate candidates;\n\u25cf develop products that are safer or more effective than our products;\n\u25cf devote greater resources than us to marketing or selling products;\n\u25cf introduce or adapt more quickly than us to new technologies and other scientific advances;\n\u25cf introduce products that render our products obsolete;\n\u25cf withstand price competition more successfully than us or our strategic partners or licensees;\n\u25cf negotiate third-party strategic alliances or licensing arrangements more effectively than us; and\n\u25cf take better advantage than us of other opportunities.\nWe are subject to potential liabilities from clinical testing and future product liability claims.\nIf any of our products are alleged to be defective, they may expose us to claims for personal injury by patients in clinical trials of our products or, if we obtain marketing approval and commercialize our products, by patients using our commercially marketed products. Even if one or more of our products is approved by the FDA, users may claim that such products caused unintended adverse effects. We maintain clinical trial insurance for our ongoing clinical trials, and we plan to seek to obtain similar insurance for any other clinical trials that we conduct. We also would seek to obtain product liability insurance covering the commercial marketing of our product candidates. We may not be able to obtain additional insurance, however, and any insurance obtained by us may prove inadequate in the event of a claim against us. Any claims asserted against us also may divert management\u2019s attention from our operations, and we may have to incur substantial costs to defend such claims even if they are unsuccessful.\nWe may be unable to successfully acquire additional technologies or products. If we require additional technologies or products, our product development plans may change and the ownership interests of our shareholders could be diluted.\nWe may seek to acquire additional technologies by licensing or purchasing such technologies, or through a merger or acquisition of one or more companies that own such technologies. We have no current understanding or agreement to acquire any technologies, however, and we may not be able to identify or successfully acquire any additional technologies. We also may seek to acquire products from third parties that already are being marketed or have been approved for marketing, although we have not currently identified any of these products. We do not have any prior experience in acquiring or marketing products approved for marketing and may need to find third parties to market any products that we might acquire.\nWe have focused our product development efforts on our oncology and neurodegenerative drug candidates, which we believe have the greatest revenue potential. If we acquire additional technologies or product candidates, we may determine to make further changes to our product development plans and business strategy to capitalize on opportunities presented by the new technologies and product candidates.\nWe may determine to issue shares of our common stock to acquire additional technologies or products or in connection with a merger or acquisition of another company. To the extent we do so, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted accordingly.\nThe impact and results of our exploration of any strategic alternatives are uncertain and may not be successful.\nFrom time to time, we may consider strategic alternatives available to us to enhance shareholder value. Strategic alternatives could include acquisition transactions and/or strategic partnerships with one or more parties, the licensing of some of our proprietary technologies, or other possible transactions. Any strategic transaction that is completed ultimately may not deliver the anticipated benefits or enhance shareholder value. Further, we may devote a significant amount of our management resources to such a transaction, which could negatively impact our operations. We may incur significant costs in connection with seeking certain acquisitions or other strategic opportunities regardless of whether the transaction is completed, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources. In the event that we consummate an acquisition or strategic alternative in the future, there is no assurance that we would fully realize the potential benefits of such a transaction. Integration may be difficult and unpredictable, and acquisition-related integration costs, including certain non-recurring charges, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. Moreover, integrating assets and businesses may significantly burden management and internal resources, including the potential loss or unavailability of key personnel. If we fail to successfully integrate any assets and businesses we acquire, we may not fully realize the potential benefits we expect, and our operating results could be adversely affected. If we pay for an acquisition in cash, it would reduce our cash available for operations or cause us to incur additional debt, and if we pay with our stock it could be dilutive to our stockholders.\nWe rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology, including any cybersecurity incidents, could harm our ability to operate our business effectively.\nWe rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology, including any cybersecurity incidents, could harm our ability to operate our business effectively. We maintain sensitive data pertaining to our Company on our computer networks, including information about our development activities, our intellectual property and other proprietary business information. Our internal computer systems and those of third parties with which we contract may be vulnerable to damage from cyber-attacks, computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures, despite the implementation of security measures. System failures, accidents or security breaches could cause interruptions to our operations, including material disruption of our development activities, result in significant data losses or theft of our intellectual property or proprietary business information, and could require substantial expenditures to remedy. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and our development programs could be delayed, any of which would harm our business and operations.\nOur business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster.\nNatural disasters could severely disrupt our operations or the operations of manufacturing facilities and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. If a natural disaster, power outage or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our headquarters, that damaged critical infrastructure, such as manufacturing facilities, or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. The disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place currently are limited and may not prove adequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial expenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nGlobal, market and economic conditions may negatively impact our business, financial condition and share price.\nConcerns over inflation, geopolitical issues, the U.S. financial markets, foreign exchange rates, capital and exchange controls, unstable global credit markets and financial conditions and the COVID-19 pandemic, have led to periods of significant economic instability, declines in consumer confidence and discretionary spending, diminished expectations for the global economy and expectations of slower global economic growth going forward, and increased unemployment rates. Our general business strategy may be adversely affected by any such economic downturns, volatile business environments and continued unstable or unpredictable economic and market conditions. If these conditions continue to deteriorate or do not improve, it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult to complete, more costly, and more dilutive. In addition, there is a risk that one or more of our current or future service providers and other partners could be negatively affected by difficult economic times, which could adversely affect our ability to attain our operating goals on schedule and on budget or meet our business and financial objectives.\nIn addition, we face several risks associated with international business and are subject to global events beyond our control, including war, public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, trade disputes, economic sanctions, trade wars and their collateral impacts and other international events. Any of these changes could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations. There may be changes to our business if there is instability, disruption or destruction in a significant geographic region, regardless of cause, including war, terrorism, riot, civil insurrection or social unrest; and natural or man-made disasters, including famine, flood, fire, earthquake, storm or disease. In February 2022, armed conflict escalated between Russia and Ukraine. The sanctions announced by the United States and other countries, following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine against Russia to date include restrictions on selling or importing goods, services or technology in or from affected regions and travel bans and asset freezes impacting connected individuals and political, military, business and financial organizations in Russia. The United States and other countries could impose wider sanctions and take other actions should the conflict further escalate. It is not possible to predict the broader consequences of this conflict, which could include further sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, geopolitical shifts and adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions, currency exchange rates and financial markets, all of which could impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.]\nWe may not be successful in hiring and retaining key employees, which may harm our business.\nOur business is highly dependent upon the continued services of our senior management and key personnel. As such, our future success depends on our ability to identify, attract, hire or engage, retain, and motivate well-qualified personnel. Our operations require qualified personnel with expertise in pharmaceutical development and clinical research We must compete for qualified individuals with numerous companies, universities, and other research institutions. Competition for such individuals is intense, and, when the need arises, we may not be able to hire the personnel necessary to support our efforts. There can be no assurance that these professionals will be available in the market, or that we will be able to retain existing professionals or to meet or to continue to meet their compensation requirements.\nAn overall tightening and increasingly competitive labor market in the U.S. employment market generally, especially in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, has been recently observed in the United States. Sustained labor shortage or increased turnover rates within our employee base, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic or as a result of general macroeconomic factors, could lead to increased costs, such as increased overtime to meet demand and increased wage rates to attract and retain employees, and could negatively affect our ability to efficiently operate and our overall business. If we are unable to hire and retain employees capable of performing at a high-level, or if mitigation measures we may take to respond to a decrease in labor availability, such as third-party outsourcing have unintended negative effects, our business could be adversely affected. An overall labor shortage, lack of skilled labor, increased turnover or labor inflation, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic or as a result of general macroeconomic factors, could have a material adverse impact on our operations, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows.]\nYou may experience future dilution as a result of future equity offerings or other equity issuances.\nTo raise additional capital, we may in the future offer additional shares of our common stock, preferred stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock. We cannot assure you that we will be able to sell shares or other securities in any other offering at a price per share that is equal to or greater than the price per share that you may have paid for any of such securities that you currently hold. The price per share at which we sell additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock in future transactions may be higher or lower than the price per share that you may have paid for previously for shares of our common stock. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities or obtaining borrowings convertible into equity, ownership dilution to existing stockholders may result and future investors may be granted rights superior to those of existing stockholders.\nOur outstanding options, warrants, convertible preferred shares, preferred investment option and the availability for resale of the underlying shares may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had outstanding stock options to purchase 2,827,829 shares of our common stock at a weighted-average exercise price of $4.92 per share and outstanding warrants to purchase 4,147 shares of common stock at a weighted-average exercise price of $33.60 per share. In addition, there are 8,240 preferred shares outstanding that can be converted into 9,336,637 shares of common stock, as well as preferred investment options that can be exercised for up to 11,363,637 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.88 per share. These outstanding convertible instruments could adversely affect our ability to obtain future financing or engage in certain mergers or other transactions, since the holders of these outstanding securities can be expected to exercise or convert them (as applicable) at a time when we may be able to obtain additional capital through a new offering of securities on terms more favorable to us than the terms of these outstanding convertible instruments. For the life of the these outstanding convertible instruments, the holders have the opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of our common stock without assuming the risk of ownership. The issuance of shares upon the exercise or conversion (as applicable) of these outstanding convertible instruments will also dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders. Many of our outstanding warrants contain anti-dilution provisions pertaining to dividends with respect to our common stock. In the event that these anti-dilution provisions are triggered by us in the future, we would likewise be required to reduce the exercise price or conversion price (as applicable), and increase the number of shares underlying those convertible instruments, which would have a dilutive effect on our stockholders.\nWe have registered with the SEC the resale by the holders of some of the shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise or conversion (as applicable) of our outstanding convertible instruments. The availability of these shares for public resale, as well as actual resales of these shares, could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nWe cannot assure investors that our internal controls will prevent future material weaknesses.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. We are required to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment needs to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting.\nThere can be no assurance that we will not suffer from material weaknesses in the future. If we fail to remediate these material weaknesses or fail to otherwise maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in the future, such failure could result in a material misstatement of our annual or quarterly consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis and which could cause investors and other users to lose confidence in our consolidated financial statements, limit our ability to raise capital and have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. Additionally, failure to remediate the material weaknesses or otherwise failing to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting may also negatively impact our operating results and financial condition, impair our ability to timely file our periodic and other reports with the SEC, subject us to additional litigation and regulatory actions and cause us to incur substantial additional costs in future periods relating to the implementation of remedial measures.\nWe are subject to legal actions that could adversely affect our financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we may be involved in legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Securities-related class action and derivative lawsuits have often been brought against companies, including many biotechnology companies, which experience volatility in the market price of their securities. This risk is especially relevant for biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies such as ours, which often experience significant stock price volatility in connection with their product development programs.\nWe must pay the first legal fees and other litigation expenses incurred up to the application retention, or deductible, amounts under our insurance policies, including our director\u2019s and officer\u2019s and other liability insurance policies, and the insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of the liabilities that we may incur in connection with the pending or possible future legal actions. As a result, any future legal actions may adversely affect out financial condition.\nOur anti-takeover measures may make it more difficult to change our management, or may discourage others from acquiring us, and thereby adversely affect stockholder value.\nWe have a stockholder rights plan and provisions in our restated by-laws, as amended, that are intended to protect our stockholders\u2019 interests by encouraging anyone seeking control of our company to negotiate with our board of directors. These provisions may discourage or prevent a person or group from acquiring us without the approval of our board of directors, even if the acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nWe have a classified board of directors, which means that at least two stockholder meetings, instead of one, will be required to effect a change in the majority control of our board of directors. This applies to every election of directors, not just an election occurring after a change in control. The classification of our board increases the amount of time it takes to change majority control of our board of directors and may cause potential acquirers to lose interest in a potential purchase of us, regardless of whether our purchase would be beneficial to us or our stockholders. The additional time and cost to change a majority of the members of our board of directors makes it more difficult and may discourage our existing stockholders from seeking to change our existing management in order to change the strategic direction or operational performance of our company.\nOur by-laws provide that directors may only be removed for cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of our capital stock then entitled to vote at an election of directors. This provision prevents stockholders from removing any incumbent director without cause. Our by-laws also provide that a stockholder must give us not fewer than 120 days but not more than 150 days\u2019 notice of a proposal or director nomination that such stockholder desires to present at any annual meeting or special meeting of our stockholders. Such provision prevents a stockholder from making a proposal or director nomination at a stockholder meeting without us having advance notice of that proposal or director nomination. This could make a change in control more difficult by providing our directors with more time to prepare an opposition to a proposed change in control. By making it more difficult to remove or install new directors, these by-law provisions may also make our existing management less responsive to the views of our stockholders with respect to our operations and other issues such as management selection and management compensation.\nWe are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may also prevent or delay a takeover of us that may be beneficial to our stockholders.\nOur restated by-laws, as amended, designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.\nOur by-laws provide that, unless we consent in writing to an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or (iv) any action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to this provision of our by-laws. This choice-of-forum provision may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision of our amended and restated by-laws inapplicable or unenforceable with respect to one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nThe Series C Certificate of Designation contains covenants that could limit our financing options and liquidity position, which would limit our ability to grow our business.\nCovenants in the certificate of designation (the \u201cSeries C Certificate of Designation\u201d) for our Preferred Stock (as defined below) impose operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions prohibit or limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u25cf pay cash dividends to our stockholders, subject to certain limited exceptions;\n\u25cf redeem or repurchase our common stock or other equity; or\n\u25cf issue any classes of stock senior to the Preferred Stock in right of dividends, redemption or distribution of assets upon certain liquidation events.\nThese restrictions may limit our ability to obtain additional financing, withstand downturns in our business or take advantage of business opportunities.\nWe may issue additional classes of preferred stock in the future, and the terms of the preferred stock may reduce the value of our common stock.\nWe are authorized to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series. In the past, we have issued shares of preferred stock, including shares of our Preferred Stock issued in 2021. Our board of directors may determine the terms of future preferred stock offerings without further action by our stockholders. If we issue preferred stock, it could affect your rights or reduce the value of our outstanding common stock. In particular, specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock may include voting rights, preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion and redemption rights, sinking fund provisions, and restrictions on our ability to merge with or sell our assets to a third party.\nWe do not expect to pay any cash dividends on our common stock.\nWe have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock or other securities, and we currently do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Because we do not anticipate paying cash dividends for the foreseeable future, our stockholders will not realize a return on their investment in our common stock except to the extent of any appreciation in the value of our common stock. Our common stock may not appreciate in value, or it may decline in value.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research and development tax credits) to offset its post-change income and taxes may be limited. In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by \u201c5% shareholders\u201d that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. As a result of a previous ownership change, our annual utilization of approximately $67.6 million in federal net operating loss carryforwards became substantially limited. If we experience ownership changes as a result of future transactions in our stock, we may be further limited in our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax assets to reduce taxes owed on the net taxable income that we earn. Any such limitations on the ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax assets could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us on any net income that we may earn in the future.", "PERMNO": 10838, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "CYTR"}
