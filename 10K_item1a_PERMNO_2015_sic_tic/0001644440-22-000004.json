{"cik": "1644440", "company": "GCP Applied Technologies Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-01", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nSummary of the Material and Other Risks Associated with Our Business\nBelow is a summary of the material risks that our business faces, which makes an investment in our common stock speculative and risky. This summary does not address all these risks. These risks are more fully described under \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Before making investment decisions regarding our common stock, you should carefully consider these risks. Those risks are not all of the risks we face and other factors not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also affect our business if they occur.\n\u2022The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and may in the future continue to adversely affect, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity\n\u2022The loss of a significant customer relationship or the delay of large or multiple contracts or a strategic project may negatively impact our financial performance.\n\u2022The length and depth of product and industry business cycles in our segments may result in periods of reduced sales, earnings and cash flows, and portions of our business are subject to seasonality, weather-related effects and other adverse events outside our control.\n\u2022Prices of certain raw materials used in our production processes are volatile and can have a significant effect on our manufacturing and supply chain procurement strategies as we seek to maximize our profitability.\n\u2022We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and we may identify additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, which may result in decline in the market price of our common stock, material misstatements of our consolidated financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations, or cause our access to the capital markets to be impaired.\n\u2022The global scope of our operations subjects us to the risks of doing business in foreign countries, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022Our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire qualified personnel.\n\u2022If we are unable to realize expected benefits from our cost reduction and restructuring efforts, our results of operations may be adversely impacted\n\u2022Our growth strategy may include the acquisition and successful integration of other businesses.\n\u2022The proposed merger is subject to approval of our stockholders as well as the satisfaction of other closing conditions, including government consents and approvals, some or all of which may not be satisfied or completed within the expected timeframe, if at all.\n\u2022We will be subject to various uncertainties while the merger is pending that may cause disruption and may make it more difficult to maintain relationships with customers and other third-party business partners.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nRisks Related to Macroeconomic Conditions\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and may in the future continue to adversely affect, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nIn December 2019, the COVID-19 virus was first identified in China and has since spread globally including countries in\nwhich we conduct our business operations. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.\nThe global spread of COVID-19 has created significant worldwide economic uncertainty which has adversely affected, and may in the future continue to adversely affect, demand for our products due to delays in construction projects and reduced construction activity, especially commercial construction. Our results of operations in 2020 were negatively impacted by COVID-19 and may continue to be impacted in future periods. We may also be negatively impacted by reductions in accounts receivable collections, customer and vendor bankruptcies, increased raw material and transportation costs, as well as significant reduction in the availability of or substantial delays or interruptions in the supply or transportation of raw materials which could negatively impact our ability to sell our products and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For example, COVID-19 has significantly impacted the global supply chain, with restrictions and limitations on related activities causing disruption and delay, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to obtain necessary raw materials and supplies, manufacture and/or distribute our products in a timely manner, or at all. These disruptions and delays have strained certain domestic and international supply chains, could negatively affect our supply chain and the flow or availability of certain materials.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has also significantly increased economic uncertainty and has led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which could increase the cost of and accessibility to capital. If we need to access the capital markets, there can be no assurance that financing may be available on attractive terms, if at all. The COVID-19 outbreak has caused a significant economic slowdown, which could be of an unknown duration, could lead to increased unemployment, reduced discretionary consumer spending and a corresponding reduction in demand for our products, and could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe virus also impacted our workforce, moving a large portion of our employees to working-from-home and adding administrative complexity to our everyday business activities. Disruption caused by business responses to the COVID-19 outbreak, including working-from-home arrangements, may create increased vulnerability to cybersecurity incidents, including breaches of information systems security, which could damage our reputation and commercial relationships, disrupt operations, increase costs and/or decrease net revenues, and expose us to claims from customers, suppliers, financial institutions, regulators, payment card associations, employees and others, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe operate facilities around the world which have been and may continue to be adversely affected by the pandemic as a result of disruptions to our supplies of raw materials, as well as the production, transportation and delivery of our products. We may not be able to supply products or services to our customers in a timely manner due to travel and transportation restrictions, as well as temporary closures of our facilities or those of our suppliers or customers as a result of regulations imposed by local governments to contain COVID-19. Our ability to adequately staff our operations may be adversely impacted by certain temporary restrictions, such as mandatory facility closures imposed by government authorities in certain countries where we operate, as well as voluntary facility closures or other measures, such as work-from-home orders and social distancing protocols, imposed for the safety of our employees or in response to actual or potential positive diagnoses for COVID-19. Despite our best efforts to protect the health, safety and well-being of our employees in accordance with guidelines issued by national and other health and safety authorities, there can be no assurance that the numbers of infected employees will not increase, and that such infections would not have a material adverse impact on our operations.\nFurthermore, our efforts to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 through social distancing measures, enhanced cleaning measures, the increased use of personal protective equipment and COVID-19 testing at our facilities, as well as other steps taken to protect the health, safety and financial security of our employees, may result in other negative impacts on our operations, including increased costs, reduced efficiency levels or labor disputes resulting in a strike or other work stoppage or interruption.\nGovernments around the world have implemented fiscal stimulus measures to counteract the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak, however, the magnitude and overall effectiveness of these actions remain uncertain. Further, the full extent of the impact of COVID-19, including preventative and protective measures put in place by governments in order to mitigate COVID-19, and the extent of its impact on our business and financial condition, will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict. We cannot predict with any certainty whether and to what degree the disruption caused by the COVID-19 outbreak and reactions thereto will continue, and we expect to face difficulty in accurately predicting our internal financial forecasts. Any prolonged restrictive measures put in place in order to control COVID-19 or other adverse public health developments in any of our targeted markets may have a material and adverse effect on our business operations and results of operations.\nThe length and depth of product and industry business cycles in our segments may result in periods of reduced sales, earnings and cash flows, and portions of our business are subject to seasonality, weather-related effects and other adverse events outside our control.\nOur construction business is cyclical in response to economic conditions and construction demand and is also seasonal and dependent on favorable weather conditions, with a decrease in construction activity during the winter months, periods of wet weather and times when other weather and climate conditions would impair construction activity. Extreme weather events, natural disasters and public health or safety emergencies on a global, regional or national level could also have material adverse impacts on our business and financial results. Moreover, it is possible that weather and climate volatilities and associated events could increase significantly in the future.\nRisks Related to Customer Relationship\nThe loss of a significant customer relationship or the delay of large or multiple contracts or a strategic project may negatively impact our financial performance.\nA significant portion of our product sales are based on individual purchase orders with no guaranteed volumes and no committed purchase times beyond the specifics of the particular order. The loss of a significant customer relationship could adversely affect our operating results. Additionally, customers may not place expected orders or delay them for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022delay in overall project timing, which may be due to a wide variety of economic, political, project-specific, weather-related, supply chain constraints or other factors;\n\u2022customer decisions to switch to a competitor, which may be driven by product quality, performance, pricing or service;\n\u2022a decision by a customer to self-manufacture, thereby replacing our products;\n\u2022merger or acquisition activities by or involving our customer; and\n\u2022significant downturn in the overall construction demand.\nRisks Related to Raw Materials and Supply Chain\nPrices of certain raw materials used in our production processes are volatile and can have a significant effect on our manufacturing and supply chain procurement strategies as we seek to maximize our profitability. If we are unable to successfully adjust our strategies in response to volatile raw material prices, such volatility could have a negative effect on our earnings.\nWe use petroleum-based materials, natural gas derivatives and other materials to manufacture our products. Prices for these materials are volatile and can have a significant effect on our pricing, sales, manufacturing and supply chain strategies as we seek to maximize our profitability. Our ability to successfully adjust strategies in response to volatile raw material prices by increasing prices for our products and services, reducing costs or taking other actions is a significant factor in maintaining or improving our profitability. If we are unable to successfully adjust our strategies in response to volatile raw material prices, such volatility could have a negative effect on our sales and earnings in future periods.\nA substantial portion of our raw materials are commodities whose prices fluctuate as market supply and demand fundamentals change. We attempt to manage exposure to price volatility of major commodities through:\n\u2022long-term supply contracts;\n\u2022customer contracts that permit adjustments for changes in prices of commodity-based materials and energy; and\n\u2022forward buying programs that layer in our expected requirements systematically over time.\nAlthough we regularly assess our exposure to raw material price volatility, we cannot always predict the prospects of volatility and we cannot always cover the risks we face in a cost-effective manner. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated these risks as suppliers are impacted by periodic surges in infection rates, possible shutdown orders, new safety restrictions, including government mandates, and disruptions to the global supply chain.\nWe have a policy of maintaining, when available, multiple sources of supply for raw materials. However, certain of our raw materials may be provided by single or sole sources of supply. We may experience shortages of raw materials, other unforeseen developments that would cause an interruption in supply, or experience fluctuations in the prices of our raw materials due to COVID-19. Even if we have multiple sources of supply for raw materials, these sources may not make up for the loss of a major supplier.\nSome of our products are either tolled or contract manufactured by third party providers, and similar potential exposures exist where these are single or sole supply relationships.\nRisks Related to Operating a Global Business\nThe global scope of our operations subjects us to the risks of doing business in foreign countries, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate our business on a global scale with approximately half of our 2021 sales generated outside of the U.S. We operate in over 30 countries and in over 30 currencies. We currently have many production facilities, technical centers and administrative and sales offices located outside of North America, including facilities and offices in Europe, Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific and Latin America. We expect non-U.S. sales to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenue. Accordingly, our business is subject to risks related to the differing legal, political, social and economic conditions and regulatory requirements of many jurisdictions, as well as risks related to the political relationship between the foreign countries in which we conduct business and the U.S.\nOur international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in local government laws, regulations and policies, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, taxation, exchange controls, capital controls, employment regulations, repatriation of earnings and risks associated with doing business in many countries. For example, earlier in 2021, we discovered a distributor in China was copying our product labels and placing them on another company\u2019s products. The local authorities are investigating this situation and the results may impact our ability to collect any related receivables, and we may decide to no longer sell product to this customer, such actions or other factors may negatively impact our sales and results of operations. Government policies on international trade and investments, such as economic and trade sanctions against certain countries, governments and/or individuals, employment regulations, repatriation of earnings, import quotas, capital controls, taxes or tariffs, whether adopted by individual governments or regional trade blocs, can affect our business, including: demand for our products and services, impact on the competitive position of our products, difficulty enforcing commercial agreements, obtaining export licenses or transferring our profits or capital from foreign operations to other countries where such funds could be more profitably deployed, increase our shipping costs, prevent us from being able to procure supplies and materials, or manufacture or sell products in certain countries. The implementation of more restrictive trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs, or the renegotiation of existing trade agreements between the U.S. and other countries, such as the People\u2019s Republic of China, or between any other countries where we sell large quantities of products and services or procure supplies and other materials incorporated into our products, including changes in applicable trade regulations as a result of the United Kingdom\u2019s (\u201cU.K.\u201d) withdrawal from the European Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d), could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, a government's policies on tariffs and trade, or retaliation by another government against such policies, may result in decreased revenue, gross margin, earnings or growth rates and difficulty in managing inventory levels and collection of customer receivables. Our international sales and operations are also sensitive to changes in foreign national priorities, as well as to political and economic instability. For example, our business in the European Union or elsewhere may be impacted by an escalation of tensions between Russia and Ukraine and any economic or trade sanctions enacted to condemn or counteract any Russian aggression towards or invasion of the Ukraine. Any such conflict may also impact our ability to secure raw materials and exacerbate the supply chain disruption we have experienced and further limit our ability to secure certain raw materials or services. Further military action or cyberattacks by Russia to counteract any sanctions may have an impact on demand for our goods and services and adversely impact our results of operation. Our success as a global business will depend, in part, upon our ability to succeed in differing legal, regulatory, economic, social and political conditions by developing, implementing and maintaining policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we do business.\nWe are exposed to currency exchange rate changes that impact our profitability and these risks could increase as a result of global political uncertainty and other risks in international markets.\nWe are exposed to currency exchange rate risk through our global operations. A substantial portion of our net sales and assets are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, at a constant level of business, our reported sales, earnings, assets and liabilities are reduced because the foreign currencies translate into fewer U.S. dollars. In addition, since we manufacture a portion of our construction products in emerging regions\nusing raw materials from suppliers in the U.S., Europe and other advanced economies, changes in the values of the currencies of these emerging regions versus the U.S. dollar, the euro and the currencies of other advanced economies in which we purchase raw materials, may adversely affect our raw material costs and results of operations.\nWe incur currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or a sale transaction using a currency different from the operating subsidiary's functional currency. Given the volatility of exchange rates, we may not be able to manage our currency transaction risks effectively, which may expose our financial condition or results of operations to significant additional risk.\nCertain business activities outside of the United States require direct or indirect interaction with governmental entities, subjecting us to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions. For example, in some countries our direct customer or one or several key stakeholders in projects that we sell products to would be state-controlled entities (SOEs).\nThe FCPA and other anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Because certain of our customer relationships outside of the U.S. are with governmental entities, we are subject to such anti-bribery laws. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws; however, these regulations are complex and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and pose a high risk for such practices. Despite our training and compliance programs, our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. Violations of anti-bribery laws or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Workforce\nOur business could be adversely affected if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire qualified personnel.\nThe market for highly-skilled workers and leaders in our industry is competitive. Throughout 2021 and 2020, we changed several senior executives, including our Chief Executive Officer. These changes may result in changes in our business strategy. We believe that our future success depends in substantial part on our ability to recruit and retain talented and highly-skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Doing so may be impacted by a number of factors, including fluctuations in economic and industry conditions, competitors\u2019 hiring practices, and the effectiveness of our compensation programs. Our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to retain and motivate our executives and other existing employees and attract new employees. If we do not succeed in retaining and motivating our existing key employees and attracting new key personnel, our results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nSome of our employees are unionized, represented by works councils or employed subject to local laws that are less favorable to employers than the laws in the United States.\nAt December 31, 2021, approximately 50 of our U.S. employees are unionized. In addition, a large number of our employees are employed in countries in which employment laws provide greater bargaining or other rights to employees than the laws in the U.S. In some, such employment rights require us to work collaboratively with legal representatives of employees to effect any changes to labor arrangements. A strike, work stoppage or slowdown by our employees or significant dispute with our employees, whether or not related to these negotiations, could result in a significant disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs.\nIf we are unable to realize expected benefits from our cost reduction and restructuring efforts, our results of operations may be adversely impacted\nIn order to operate more efficiently, reduce costs and improve profitability, we announce from time to time restructuring plans which include workforce reductions, global facility consolidations and other cost reduction initiatives. We announced restructuring plans in 2021 and 2019 and may undertake further workforce reductions or restructuring actions in the future. These types of restructuring activities and initiatives are complex. If we do not successfully manage our current or future restructuring plans, we may not realize expected cost savings, operating efficiencies and profitability improvements and our operations could be adversely affected. Risks associated with these actions include workforce management issues, additional unexpected costs, unforeseen delays in the implementation of anticipated workforce reductions, adverse impact on employee morale and failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees. Any of such risks may impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions or have a material adverse impact on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nRisks Related to the Proposed Merger\nThe proposed Merger is subject to approval of our stockholders as well as the satisfaction of other closing conditions, including government consents and approvals, some or all of which may not be satisfied or completed within the expected timeframe, if at all.\nCompletion of the Merger is subject to a number of closing conditions, including obtaining approval of our stockholders, the expiration or termination of any waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the consummation of the Merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the \u201cHSR Act\u201d), and receipt of other required regulatory approvals, consents or clearances with respect to the Merger under applicable competition and/or foreign direct investment laws. We can provide no assurance that all required consents and approvals will be obtained or that all closing conditions will otherwise be satisfied (or waived, if applicable), and, even if all required consents and approvals can be obtained and all closing conditions are satisfied (or waived, if applicable), we can provide no assurance as to the terms, conditions and timing of such consents and approvals or the timing of the completion of the Merger. Many of the conditions to completion of the Merger are not within our control, and we cannot predict when or if these conditions will be satisfied (or waived, if applicable). Any adverse consequence of the pending finalization of the Merger could be exacerbated by any delays in completion of the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement.\nEach party\u2019s obligation to consummate the Merger is also subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party (subject to customary materiality qualifications) and compliance in all material respects with the covenants and agreements contained in the Merger Agreement as of the closing of the Merger, including, with respect to us, covenants regarding conducting our business in the ordinary course and to not engage in certain kinds of material transactions prior to closing. In addition, the Merger Agreement may be terminated under certain specified circumstances, including, but not limited to, in connection with a change in the recommendation of our board of directors or by us to enter into an agreement for a \u201cSuperior Proposal,\u201d as defined in the Merger Agreement. As a result, we cannot assure you that the Merger will be completed, even if our stockholders approve the Merger, or that, if completed, it will be exactly on the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement or within the expected time frame.\nWe may not complete the proposed Merger within the time frame we anticipate or at all, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial results and/or operations.\nThe proposed Merger may not be completed within the expected timeframe, or at all, as a result of various factors and conditions, some of which may be beyond our control. If the Merger is not completed for any reason, including as a result of our stockholders failing to adopt the Merger Agreement, our stockholders will not receive any payment for their shares of our common stock in connection with the Merger. Instead, we will remain a public company, our common stock will continue to be listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) and registered under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), and we will be required to continue to file periodic reports with the SEC. Moreover, our ongoing business may be materially adversely affected, and we would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on our stock price, and it is uncertain when, if ever, the price of the shares would return to the prices at which the shares currently trade;\n\u2022we may experience negative publicity, which could have an adverse effect on our ongoing operations including, but not limited to, retaining and attracting employees, customers, partners, suppliers and others with whom we do business;\n\u2022we will still be required to pay certain significant costs relating to the Merger, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor, printing and other professional services fees, which may relate to activities that we would not have undertaken other than in connection with the Merger;\n\u2022we may be required to pay a cash termination fee to Saint-Gobain of up to $71 million, as required under the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances;\n\u2022while the Merger Agreement is in effect, we are subject to restrictions on our business activities, including, among other things, restrictions on our ability to engage in certain kinds of material transactions, which could prevent us from pursuing strategic business opportunities, taking actions with respect to our business that we may consider advantageous and responding effectively and/or timely to competitive pressures and industry developments, and may as a result materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition;\n\u2022matters relating to the Merger require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management, which could result in the distraction of management from ongoing business operations and pursuing other opportunities that could have been beneficial to us; and\n\u2022we may commit significant time and resources to defending against litigation related to the Merger.\nIf the Merger is not consummated, the risks described above may materialize and they may have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial results and stock price, particularly to the extent that the current market price of our common stock reflects an assumption that the Merger will be completed.\nWe will be subject to various uncertainties while the Merger is pending that may cause disruption and may make it more difficult to maintain relationships with customers and other third-party business partners.\nOur efforts to complete the Merger could cause substantial disruptions in, and create uncertainty surrounding, our business, which may materially adversely affect our results of operation and our business. Uncertainty as to whether the Merger will be completed may affect our ability to recruit prospective employees or to retain and motivate existing employees. Employee retention may be particularly challenging while the Merger is pending because employees may experience uncertainty about their roles following the Merger. As mentioned above, a substantial amount of our management\u2019s and employees\u2019 attention is being directed toward the completion of the Merger and thus is being diverted from our day-to-day operations. Uncertainty as to our future could adversely affect our business and our relationship with customers and potential customers. For example, customers, suppliers and other third parties may defer decisions concerning working with us, or seek to change existing business relationships with us. Changes to or termination of existing business relationships could adversely affect our revenue, earnings and financial condition, as well as the market price of our common stock. The adverse effects of the pendency of the Merger could be exacerbated by any delays in completion of the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement.\nIn certain instances, the Merger Agreement requires us to pay a termination fee to Saint-Gobain, which could affect the decisions of a third party considering making an alternative acquisition proposal.\nUnder the terms of the Merger Agreement, we may be required to pay Saint-Gobain a termination fee of $71 million under specified conditions, including in the event Saint-Gobain terminates the Merger Agreement before receipt of our stockholders approval due to a change in recommendation by our board of directors, in the event we terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into a \u201cSuperior Proposal,\u201d as defined in the Merger Agreement, or in the event we enter into an alternative transaction within nine months of termination of the Merger Agreement in certain circumstances and such alternative transaction is consummated. This payment could affect the structure, pricing and terms proposed by a third party seeking to acquire or merge with us and could discourage a third party from making a competing acquisition proposal, including a proposal that would be more favorable to our stockholders than the Merger.\nWe have incurred, and will continue to incur, direct and indirect costs as a result of the Merger.\nWe have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs and expenses, including regulatory costs, fees for professional services and other transaction costs, in connection with the Merger, for which we will have received little or no benefit if the Merger is not completed. There are a number of factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of these costs and expenses. Many of these fees and costs will be payable by us even if the Merger is not completed and may relate to activities that we would not have undertaken other than to complete the Merger.\nLitigation challenging the Merger Agreement may prevent the Merger from being consummated at all or within the expected timeframe.\nLawsuits have been filed against us and our Board of Directors and may in the future be filed against us, our Board of Directors or other parties to the Merger Agreement, challenging our acquisition by Saint-Gobain or making other claims in connection therewith. Such lawsuits may be brought by our purported stockholders and may seek, among other things, to enjoin consummation of the Merger. One of the conditions to the consummation of the Merger is that the consummation of the merger is not restrained, made illegal, enjoined or prohibited by any order or legal or regulatory restraint or prohibition of a court of competent jurisdiction or any governmental entity. As such, if the plaintiffs in such potential lawsuits are successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the defendants from completing the Merger on the agreed upon terms, then such injunction may prevent the Merger from becoming effective, or from becoming effective within the expected timeframe.\nRisks Related to Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and we may identify additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, which may result in decline in the market price of our common stock, material misstatements of our consolidated financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations, or cause our access to the capital markets to be impaired.\nManagement\u2019s assessment has identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting- see Item 9A, \u201cControls and Procedures,\u201d below. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management has developed a remediation plan intended to address the deficiencies which resulted in the material weaknesses. Management began implementing the remediation efforts in 2021 and expects these efforts as well as other future remediation efforts related to the material weaknesses to be effectively implemented. We may identify deficiencies or other material weaknesses, in addition to the ones already identified, which we may not be able to remediate in a timely manner. If we continue to have one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will not be able to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment, or delays in completing our internal control audit and financial statement audit, could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could result in a decline in the market price of our common stock, and cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations in the future, which in turn could impact our ability to raise equity financing if needed in the future. While we believe our reported balances within our consolidated financial statements are accurate, until these material weaknesses are remediated, it is possible that internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect material misstatements reflected in our financial statements.\nRisks Related to Indebtedness and Liquidity\nWe have debt obligations that could restrict our business, adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows or restrict our ability to return cash to shareholders.\nAt December 31, 2021, we had $350.9 million of indebtedness outstanding. The amount of and terms governing the Company\u2019s indebtedness may have material effects on our business, including to:\n\u2022require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to debt payments, thereby reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, research and development, distributions to holders of company common stock and other purposes;\n\u2022restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or taking advantage of favorable business opportunities;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate;\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to adverse economic, credit and industry conditions, including recessions;\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have relatively less debt; and\n\u2022limit our ability to borrow additional funds, dispose of assets to raise funds, incur certain liens, or enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions, if needed, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, research and development and other purposes.\nIf we fail to comply with certain restrictions imposed by our debt agreements, including maintaining the financial ratios required by our credit facilities, our debt could be accelerated and the Company may not have sufficient cash to pay the accelerated debt. Please refer to Note 6, \u201cDebt\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the information related to our debt obligations.\nWe may also incur additional indebtedness in the future. If we incur additional debt, the risks related to our indebtedness may intensify.\nWe have unfunded and underfunded pension plan liabilities. We will require future operating cash flow to fund these liabilities. We have no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash to satisfy these obligations.\nWe maintain U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans covering current and former employees who meet or met age and service requirements. Our net pension liability and cost is materially affected by the discount rate used to measure pension obligations, the longevity and actuarial profile of our workforce, the level of plan assets available to fund those obligations and the actual and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Significant changes in investment performance or a change in the portfolio mix of invested assets can result in corresponding increases and decreases in the valuation of plan assets or in a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets. In addition, any changes in the discount rate could result in a significant increase or decrease in the valuation of pension obligations, affecting the reported funded status of our pension plans, as well as the net periodic pension cost in the following years. Similarly, changes in the expected return on plan assets can result in significant changes in the net periodic pension cost in the following years which would potentially impact our financial results.\nRisks Related to Innovation and IP\nIf we are not able to continue our technological innovation and successful introduction of new products, our customers may turn to other suppliers to meet their requirements.\nThe specialty chemicals and building materials industries, as well as the end-use applications into which we sell our products, experience ongoing technological change and product improvements. A key element of our business strategy is to invest in research and development activities with the goal of introducing new high-performance, technically differentiated products and innovative solutions. If we fail to keep pace with evolving technological innovations or fail to improve our products in response to our customers\u2019 needs, then our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of reduced sales of our products. Moreover, for these innovative products, market adoption may face challenges relative to customer acceptance or technical or regulatory hurdles.\nOur business and financial condition could be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our material IP or there is a loss in the actual or perceived value of our brands.\nOur business and financial condition could be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our material patents, trademarks and other proprietary information. We have numerous valuable patents, trade secrets and know-how, domain names, trademarks and trade names, including certain marks that are significant to our business. We routinely seek to protect our patents, trademarks, and other confidential information and know-how by taking appropriate preventive and enforcement measures. Despite our efforts, unauthorized use or disclosure of our IP could negatively impact our business and financial condition.\nThe reputation of our branded products depends on numerous factors, including the successful advertising and marketing of our brand names, consumer acceptance, continued trademark validity, the availability of similar products from our competitors, and our ability to maintain our products\u2019 quality and technological advantages and claims of superior performance. A loss of a brand or the actual or perceived value of our brands could limit or reduce the demand for our products, and could negatively impact our business and financial condition. IP protection varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and such inconsistencies may pose a threat to the value of our IP.\nWe may be subject to infringement claims relative to third party IP rights that could adversely affect our business, despite our efforts to monitor the published patent and trademark applications of our competitors. Any claims that our products or processes infringe the IP rights of others, regardless of the merit or resolution of the claims, could cause us to incur significant costs in responding to, defending, and resolving the claims, and may divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business. If we are found to be infringing on the IP rights of others, we may be held liable for damages, and we may be required to change our processes, redesign our products, pay others to obtain a license under their IP rights, stop using the contested trademark or technology, or stop producing or selling the infringing product. On the other hand, even if we were to prevail in establishing non-infringement, invalidity, and/or non-enforceability of the IP rights being asserted against us, the existence of the lawsuit could prompt our customers to switch to products that are not the subject of the lawsuit.\nRisks Related to Cybersecurity and Data Privacy\nA failure of our information technology systems could adversely impact our business and operations.\nWe rely upon the capacity, reliability and security of our information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) infrastructure, the infrastructure\nof third parties and our ability to expand and continually update this infrastructure in response to the changing needs of our business. Our IT systems, and those of our current and any future suppliers, vendors, and other contractors or consultants, are vulnerable to damages from computer viruses, malware or other malicious code, unauthorized access, cyber-attack, phishing attacks, ransomware, account takeovers, denial of service attacks, human error, disruption, loss or destruction of data, natural disasters, power outages and other similar disruptions. If we experience a problem with the functioning of an important IT system or if our security measures, or those of our service providers, are compromised as a result of third-party action, employee or customer error, malfeasance, stolen or fraudulently obtained log-in credentials or otherwise, our reputation could be damaged, our business may be harmed and we could incur significant liability. Additionally, if third parties with whom we work, such as vendors or suppliers, violate applicable laws or security policies, such violations may also put our customers\u2019 information at risk and could in turn have an adverse effect on our business. If the security measures of our customers or our service providers, are compromised, even without any actual compromise of our own systems, we may face negative publicity or reputational harm if our customers or anyone else incorrectly attributes the blame for such security breaches to us or our systems. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future and to alleviate problems caused by such breaches, such as investigative and remediation costs, the costs of providing individuals and/or data owners with notice of the breach, legal fees, the costs of any additional fraud detection activities, or the costs of prolonged system disruptions or shutdowns.\nAccordingly, if our IT infrastructure, cybersecurity measures or those of our service providers fail to protect against unauthorized access, attacks (which may include sophisticated cyberattacks), compromise or the mishandling of data by our employees and contractors, then our reputation, customer trust, business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Cyber incidents have been increasing in sophistication and frequency and can include third parties gaining access to employee or customer data using stolen or inferred credentials, computer malware, viruses, spamming, phishing attacks, ransomware, card skimming code, and other deliberate attacks and attempts to gain unauthorized access. The techniques that may be used to sabotage or to obtain unauthorized access to our systems, networks, or physical facilities in which data is stored or through which data is transmitted could change frequently, and we may be unable to implement adequate preventative measures or stop security breaches while they are occurring.\nWe are subject to data privacy regulations.\nWe and certain of our third-party vendors receive and store personal information in connection with our human resources operations and other aspects of our business. Regulations around data protection and data privacy in the U.S., Europe, including but not limited to the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) and the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), and elsewhere in the world can be complex and interpretations of such regulations are evolving. Despite our internal controls and processes designed to protect sensitive information, there can be no assurance that such controls and processes will ensure we are fully compliant with all data protection and data privacy laws. Failure to adequately protect sensitive information and timely report any security incident may result in financial penalties that may be material to our financial results. In addition, our business may be materially impacted if a security incident causes significant damage to our relationships with our customers, employees, vendors or others.\nRisks Related to Environmental, Health and Safety impacts of our operations\nWe may be required to spend significant amounts of financial resources on environmental compliance.\nAs a manufacturer of specialty chemicals and specialty building materials, we are subject to stringent regulations under numerous U.S. federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations relating to the generation, storage, handling, discharge, disposition and stewardship of hazardous wastes and other materials. We expend funds to comply with such laws and regulations and attempt to implement sustainable practices across our global operations. Legislative and regulatory uncertainties make it difficult for us to project future spending and we may be required to make substantial or unanticipated investments to remain in compliance.\nWe work with dangerous materials that can injure our employees, damage our facilities and disrupt our operations.\nSome of our operations involve the handling of hazardous materials that may pose the risk of fire, explosion or the release of hazardous substances. Such events could result from operational failures, natural disasters or terrorist attacks, and might cause injury or loss of life to our employees and others, environmental contamination, and property damage. These events might cause a temporary shutdown of an affected plant or portion thereof, and we could be subject to penalties or claims as a result. A disruption of our operations caused by these or other events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOther Risks\nThe divestiture of our Darex business could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn July 2017, we completed the sale of our Darex business to Henkel AG & Co. KGaA (\u201cHenkel\u201d). We are still engaged in post-acquisition matters with Henkel in certain regions, which could negatively affect our results of operations. The Purchase and Sale Agreement with Henkel regarding the sale of our Darex Business dated July 3, 2017 (the \u201cHenkel Purchase Agreement\u201d), contains obligations for us as sellers to indemnify Henkel as buyer for certain matters, such as breaches of representations and warranties, taxes, as well as certain covenants and liabilities. We cannot predict the nature of and amount of any indemnity obligations we may have to the purchaser. Such payments may be costly and may adversely impact our financial condition.\nIn March 2021, Henkel filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against us, seeking indemnification for alleged breaches of representations and warranties under the Henkel Purchase Agreement. Henkel is seeking damages of approximately $11 million, which consist of a claim amount of approximately $16 million, net of a contractual deductible of approximately $5 million. We believe that we have meritorious defenses against the plaintiff\u2019s claims, and we intend to defend this action vigorously. Although we do not believe that resolution of this matter will have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition, at this time, based on available information regarding this litigation, we are unable to reasonably assess the ultimate outcome of this case or determine an estimate, or a range of estimates, of potential losses, if any, that might result from an adverse resolution of this matter.\nWe are subject to business continuity risks associated with centralization of certain functions.\nWe have centralized our manufacturing for certain Specialty Building Material products in single locations, such as Wuhan, China and Mount Pleasant, Tennessee, and certain administrative functions in designated centers around the world, such as Manila, Philippines, to improve efficiency and reduce costs. To the extent that these central locations are disrupted or disabled, manufacturing of certain SBM products or key business processes, such as invoicing, payments and general management operations, could be interrupted.\nOur effective income tax rate may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, which may affect our earnings and earnings per share.\nOur quarterly effective income tax rate is influenced by our annual projected profitability in the various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate. Changes in the distribution of profits and losses among taxing jurisdictions may have a significant impact on our effective income tax rate, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our stock price. Factors that affect the effective income tax rate include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022the requirement to exclude from our quarterly worldwide effective income tax calculations losses in jurisdictions in which no tax benefit can be recognized;\n\u2022actual and projected full-year pretax income;\n\u2022changes in tax laws in various taxing jurisdictions;\n\u2022audits by taxing authorities; and\n\u2022the establishment of valuation allowances against deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that future tax benefits will not be realized.\nRisks Relating to the Separation\nIf the distribution and certain related transactions fail to qualify under applicable Internal Revenue Code provisions, Grace, the Company and Grace shareholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities and, in certain circumstances, the Company could be required to indemnify Grace for taxes and other related amounts, which may be material, pursuant to indemnification obligations under the Tax Sharing Agreement.\nAs a condition to the distribution that effected the Separation, Grace was required to receive an opinion of counsel, in form and substance satisfactory to Grace in its sole discretion, regarding the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the distribution and certain related transactions. The opinion of counsel was based upon and relied on, among other things, certain facts and assumptions, as well as certain representations, statements and undertakings of Grace and us, including those relating to our and Grace's past and future conduct. If any of these representations, statements or undertakings were, or become, inaccurate or incomplete, or if Grace or GCP breach any of its covenants in the Separation documents, such as the\nTax Sharing Agreement, the opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized.\nNotwithstanding the opinion of counsel, the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) could determine that the distribution and certain related transactions failed to qualify under applicable Internal Revenue Code provisions if it determines that any of the representations, assumptions or undertakings upon which the opinion of counsel were based were false or have been violated, or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel. The opinion of counsel is not binding on the IRS and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not assert a contrary position.\nIf the distribution is determined to fail to qualify under applicable Internal Revenue Code (the \u201cCode\u201d) provisions, then, in general, Grace may recognize taxable gain as if it had sold our common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value (unless Grace and GCP jointly make an election under Section 336(e) of the Code with respect to the distribution, in which case, in general, we would (i) recognize taxable gain as if we had sold all of our assets in a taxable sale in exchange for an amount equal to the fair market value of our common stock and the assumption of all of our liabilities and (ii) obtain a related step up in the basis of our assets), and Grace shareholders at the time of the distribution who received shares of our common stock in the distribution would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares.\nUnder the Tax Sharing Agreement entered into between Grace and GCP, we may be required to indemnify Grace against any additional taxes and related amounts resulting from (1) an acquisition under certain circumstances of all or a portion of our equity securities or assets, whether by merger or otherwise (and regardless of whether we participated in or otherwise facilitated the acquisition), (2) other actions that we may take or fail to, or (3) any of our representations or undertakings made in connection with the Separation and the distribution being incorrect or violated. Any such indemnity obligations could be material. In addition, Grace, GCP and our respective subsidiaries may incur certain tax costs in connection with the Separation, including non-U.S. tax costs resulting from Separations in non-U.S. jurisdictions, which may be material.\nIn connection with the Separation, Grace agreed to indemnify the Company for certain liabilities and we have agreed to indemnify Grace for certain liabilities. If the Company is required to act on these indemnities to Grace, we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations and our financial results could be negatively impacted. The Grace indemnity may not be sufficient to insure the Company against the full amount of liabilities for which it may be allocated responsibility, and Grace may not be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future.\nPursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and the Tax Sharing Agreement, Grace agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities, and we agreed to indemnify Grace for certain liabilities, and we agreed to indemnify Grace in each case for uncapped amounts, as discussed further in Note 18, \u201cRelated Party Transactions\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K. Indemnities that we may be required to provide Grace are not subject to any cap, may be significant and could negatively impact our business, particularly indemnities relating to our actions that could impact the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the distribution and certain related transactions. Third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that Grace has agreed to retain. Further, the indemnity from Grace may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, and Grace may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Grace any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur share price may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022fluctuations in our quarterly or annual earnings results or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022failures of our operating results to meet the estimates of security analysts or the expectations of shareholders or changes by security analysts in their estimates of our future earnings;\n\u2022announcements made by us or our customers, suppliers or competitors;\n\u2022changes in laws or regulations which adversely affect us or our industry;\n\u2022changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022general economic, industry and stock market conditions;\n\u2022future sales of company common stock by shareholders;\n\u2022future issuances of our stock by us;\n\u2022repurchases under our share repurchase program;\n\u2022stockholder activism, which may disrupt operations, divert management and employee attention, cause uncertainty that could adversely affect our relationships with customers, suppliers and employees, and require us to incur significant fees and expenses; and\n\u2022the other factors described in these \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and other parts of this Annual Report on this Form 10-K.\nIn addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations including in connection with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Although the markets recovered, market and industry factors, including potentially worsening economic conditions and other adverse effects or developments relating to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, may significantly reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nOur share repurchase program may not be the most effective use of our capital and, if shares are repurchased under the program, could increase the volatility of the price of our common stock. While the Board authorized a share repurchase program, no shares have been repurchased to date, and the Company does not expect to repurchase any shares in the foreseeable future.\nOn July 30, 2020, the Board authorized a program to repurchase up to a maximum of $100 million of our common stock through July 30, 2022. No shares were repurchased during 2021 or 2020. The Merger Agreement does not permit GCP to repurchase any shares without the prior consent of Saint-Gobain, and currently, we do not intend to repurchase any shares.\nProvisions in the Company\u2019s corporate documents, the Stockholder Rights Plan, the Tax Sharing Agreement and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change-in-control of the Company, even if that change may be considered beneficial by some Company shareholders.\nThe existence of some provisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, our Stockholder Rights Plan and of Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of the Company that a shareholder may consider favorable. These provisions include:\n\u2022authorization of a large number of shares of common or preferred stock that are not yet issued, which may permit our Board of Directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management, thereby protecting the continuity of the Company's management, or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of the Company;\n\u2022prohibition on shareholders calling special meetings and taking action by written consent; and\n\u2022advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to the Company\u2019s Board and for proposing matters to be acted on by shareholders at the annual shareholder meetings.\nWe adopted a stockholder rights plan on March 15, 2019. The rights plan is not intended to prevent a takeover, and we believe it will enable all GCP stockholders to realize the full potential value of their investment in the Company and protect the Company and its stockholders from efforts to obtain control of GCP that are inconsistent with the best interests of GCP and its stockholders. The rights plan may impose a significant penalty upon any person or group that attempts to acquire us (or a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock) without the approval of the Board of Directors. The rights under the plan were initially set to expire on March 14, 2020. On March 13, 2020, the Board extended the final expiration date of the Stockholder Rights Plan to March 14, 2023, subject to stockholders' approval at GCP\u2019s 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders which was obtained on May 28, 2020. On December 5, 2021, in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement we entered into the Second Amendment to the Rights Agreement, which renders the Stockholder Rights Plan inapplicable to the Merger Agreement. Additionally, the Stockholder Rights Plan will terminate and expire immediately prior the effective time of the proposed Merger.\nIn addition, the Company is subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d), which may have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors,\nincluding discouraging takeover attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for shares of company common stock.\nWe believe these provisions protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors and by providing the Board of Directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal as compared to its long-term plan as a standalone company. However, these provisions apply even if a proposal may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our Board of Directors determines is not in the best interests of GCP and our shareholders.\nIn addition, an acquisition or further issuance of our stock could trigger the application of Section 355(e) of the Code. Under the Tax Sharing Agreement, the Company would be required to indemnify Grace for any resulting tax and related amounts, and this indemnity obligation might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control that you may consider favorable.\nOur bylaws include a forum selection clause, which could limit our stockholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nOur bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for any state law claims for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach or a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors or officers or other employees to us or to our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers or other employees arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrines, will be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. This forum selection provision of our bylaws may limit the ability of our stockholders to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us. Unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the U.S. shall be the sole and exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d). It is also possible that, notwithstanding the forum selection clause included in our bylaws, a court could rule that such a provision is inapplicable or unenforceable.\nThe Company may issue preferred stock with terms that could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of company common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our shareholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our Board generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of company common stock. For example, we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences that we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.\nThe Company does not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe currently intend to retain future earnings to finance our business. As a result, GCP does not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. All decisions regarding the payment of dividends by GCP will be made by our Board of Directors from time to time in accordance with applicable law. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient surplus under Delaware law to be able to pay any dividends at any time in the future. This may result from extraordinary cash expenses, actual expenses exceeding contemplated costs, funding of capital expenditures, increases in reserves or other currently unknown reasons. In addition, the Merger Agreement does not permit GCP to pay cash dividends without the prior consent of Saint-Gobain. If we do not pay dividends, the price of our common stock must appreciate in order for your investment to increase in value. This appreciation may not occur. Further, you may have to sell some or all of your shares of our common stock in order to generate cash flow from your investment.", "PERMNO": 15917, "SIC": 2860, "TIC": "GCP"}
