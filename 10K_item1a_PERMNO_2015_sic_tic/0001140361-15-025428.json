{"cik": "894237", "company": "COGENTIX MEDICAL INC /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-06-25", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nOur operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may affect our financial results, our accounting, and the accuracy of the statements we make in this Form 10-K. For example, we make statements about our belief in the efficacy of our product, the impact of regulatory and reimbursement approvals on our products and revenues, the attributes of our products versus those of our competitors, the adequacy of our resources, including cash, available to us, and other matters all of which represent our expectations or beliefs about future events. Our actual results may vary from these expectations because of a number of factors that affect our business, the most important of which include the following:\nRisks Related to the Combination of Vision and Uroplasty\nWe plan to obtain additional financing, which may not be available on favorable terms at the time it is needed and which could reduce our operational and strategic flexibility.\nWe plan to obtain additional financing in fiscal 2016. We will seek to acquire that through additional equity and/or debt financing arrangements, which may or may not be available on favorable terms at such time. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders will experience dilution. Debt financing, if available, may involve covenants restricting our operations or our ability to incur additional debt. Any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders. If we do not have, or are not able to obtain, sufficient funds, we may have to delay development or commercialization of our products or license to third parties the rights to commercialize products or technologies that we would otherwise seek to commercialize. We also may have to reduce marketing, customer support or other resources devoted to our products or cease operations.\nWe may be unable to successfully integrate Uroplasty\u2019s and Vision\u2019s operations or realize the anticipated cost savings and other potential benefit of the merger in a timely manner, if at all. As a result, the value of our shares may be adversely affected.\nUroplasty and Vision entered into the merger agreement because each company believed that the merger will be beneficial to our respective stockholders, other stakeholders and businesses. Achieving the anticipated potential benefit of the merger will depend in part upon whether we are able to integrate predecessor companies\u2019 operations in an efficient and effective manner. The integration process may not be completed smoothly or successfully. The necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations, systems and facilities and addressing possible differences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures and management philosophies may increase the difficulties of integration. Uroplasty and Vision operated numerous systems, including those involving management information, purchasing, accounting and finance, sales, billing, payroll, employee benefit and regulatory compliance. Uroplasty and Vision have inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures or policies that could affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees and/or to achieve the anticipated benefit of the merger. The integration of certain operations requires the dedication of significant management resources, which may temporarily distract management\u2019s attention from our day-to-day business. Employee uncertainty and lack of focus during the integration process may also disrupt our business. A failure of our management to integrate successfully the operations of the two companies, or such integration of the operations, if any, within a longer time frame than expected could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. We may not be able to achieve the anticipated operating and cost synergies or long-term strategic benefit of the merger. An inability to realize the full extent of, or any of, the anticipated benefit of the merger, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results, which may negatively affect the value of our shares.\nOur success will depend in part upon the ability to retain key employees of each predecessor company. Competition for qualified personnel can be very intense. In addition, key employees may depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty or difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with us. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that key employees will be retained.\nWe are in the process of combining the two predecessor companies. The actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, and the anticipated benefit of the integration plan may not be realized.\nOur future results will suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations.\nWe anticipate that the size of our business will increase significantly beyond the current size of either our predecessor businesses. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to manage this expanded business, which will pose substantial challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity. There can be no assurances that we will be successful or that we will realize the expected operating efficiencies, cost savings and other benefit currently anticipated from the merger.\nWe have incurred direct and indirect costs as a result of the merger.\nWe have incurred substantial expenses in connection with completing the merger, and over a period of time following completion of the merger, we further expect to incur substantial expenses in connection with coordinating the businesses, operations, policies and procedures of Uroplasty and Vision. While Uroplasty and Vision have assumed that a certain level of transaction and coordination expenses will be incurred, there are a number of factors beyond the combined company\u2019s control that could affect the total amount or the timing of these transaction and coordination expenses. Many of the expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately. These expenses may exceed the costs historically incurred by Uroplasty and Vision.\nOur actual financial positions and results of operations may differ materially from the unaudited pro forma financial data.\nThe pro forma financial information contained in Note 2 to the \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d in Part II, Item 8 of this report and previously provided by us has been presented for illustrative purposes only and may not be an indication of what the our financial position or results of operations will be in the future. The pro forma financial information has been derived from the audited and unaudited historical financial statements of Uroplasty and Vision-Sciences, and certain adjustments and assumptions have been made regarding the combined company after giving effect to the transaction. The assets and liabilities of Uroplasty and Vision-Sciences have been measured at their fair value based on various preliminary estimates using assumptions that management believes are reasonable utilizing information currently available. The process for estimating the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities requires the use of judgment in determining the appropriate assumptions and estimates. These purchase price estimates may be revised as additional information becomes available and as additional analyses are performed. Differences between preliminary estimates in the pro forma financial information and the final acquisition accounting will occur and could have a material impact on the pro forma financial information and our financial position and future results of operations.\nThe assumptions used in preparing the pro forma financial information may not prove to be accurate, and other factors may affect our financial condition or results of operations. Any potential decline in our financial condition or results of operations may cause significant variations in our share price.\nIf goodwill or other intangible assets that we recorded in connection with the merger become impaired, we could be required to take significant charges against earnings.\nIn connection with the accounting for the merger, we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets. Under U.S. GAAP, we must assess, at least annually and potentially more frequently, whether the value of our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets has been impaired. Amortizing intangible assets will be assessed for impairment in the event of an impairment indicator. Any impairment of the value of goodwill or other intangible assets will result in a charge against earnings, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and stockholders\u2019 equity in future periods.\nRisks Related to the Company\nWe continue to incur losses and may never reach profitability.\nWe have incurred net losses in each of the last five fiscal years. As of March 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $52 million primarily because of costs relating to the development, including seeking regulatory approvals, and commercialization of our products. We expect our operating expenses relating to sales and marketing activities along with product development and clinical trials will continue to increase during the foreseeable future. To achieve profitability, we must generate substantially more revenue than we have in generated prior years. Our ability to achieve significant revenue growth will depend, in large part, on our ability to successfully integrate our predecessor companies following the merger, to achieve widespread market acceptance of our products and successfully expand our business in the U.S. We may never achieve these objectives or otherwise become profitable.\nThe size and resources of our competitors may render it difficult for us to successfully compete in the marketplace.\nOur products compete against similar medical devices and other treatment methods, including drugs. Many of our competitors, which include some of the largest medical products and pharmaceutical companies in the world, have significantly greater financial, research and development, manufacturing and marketing resources than we have. Our competitors could use and have used these resources to develop and/or acquire products that may be safer, more effective, less invasive, less expensive or more readily accepted than our products. Their products could make our technology and products obsolete or noncompetitive. Our competitors could also devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends upon our ability to distinguish our brand and our products from our competitors and their products and to obtain adequate reimbursement for procedures performed using our products. Factors affecting our competitive position include:\n\u25cf ability to sell products tailored to meet the applications needs of our customers and patients;\n\u25cf sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities;\n\u25cf product performance and design;\n\u25cf quality of customer support;\n\u25cf product pricing;\n\u25cf product safety;\n\u25cf success and timing of new product development and introductions; and\n\u25cf\nintellectual property protection.\nOur stock price may fluctuate and be volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations due to the following factors, among others:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated variations in operating results;\n\u25cf conditions or trends in the medical device market;\n\u25cf announcements of new or acquired products or technologies by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of significant customer wins or losses, gains or losses of distributors;\n\u25cf technological innovations, new products or services;\n\u25cf the success of our efforts to acquire or license additional products;\n\u25cf additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf actual or expected sales of a large number of shares of our common stock;\n\u25cf availability of sources of capital;\n\u25cf adverse litigation;\n\u25cf unfavorable legislative or regulatory decisions;\n\u25cf developments in U.S. or international reimbursement systems;\n\u25cf variations in interest rates;\n\u25cf general market and economic conditions;\n\u25cf availability of components on acceptable terms;\n\u25cf availability of distributor arrangements on favorable terms; and\n\u25cf changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance or interpretations.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, the NASDAQ Capital Market, and the market for shares of novel technology and medical device companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Further, the market prices of life science companies have been unusually volatile in recent years, and such volatility may continue for the foreseeable future. These broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In addition, this volatility and the low level of market liquidity for our common stock could adversely affect an investor\u2019s ability to sell shares of our common stock and the available price for such shares, at any given time.\nIn the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the targets of securities class action litigation. We may become the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert management attention, which could seriously harm our business.\nWe may attempt to acquire new products or technologies, and if we are unable to successfully complete these acquisitions or to integrate acquired businesses, products, technologies or employees, we may fail to realize expected benefit or harm our existing business.\nOur success will depend, in part, on our ability to expand our product offerings and grow our business in response to changing technologies, customer demands and competitive pressures. In some circumstances, we may seek to do so through the acquisition of complementary businesses, products or technologies rather than through internal development. The identification of suitable acquisition candidates and obtaining adequate financing can be difficult, time consuming and costly, and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisitions. Furthermore, even if we successfully complete an acquisition, we may not be able to successfully integrate newly acquired organizations, products or technologies into our operations, and the process of integration could be expensive, time consuming and may strain our resources. Consequently, we may not achieve anticipated benefits of the acquisitions, which could harm our existing business. In addition, future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or expenses, or other charges such as in-process research and development, any of which could harm our business and affect our financial results or cause a reduction in the price of our common stock.\nIf we are not able to acquire or license other products, our business and future growth prospects could suffer.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we intend to acquire or license additional products and technologies for development and commercialization. The success of this strategy depends upon our ability to identify, select and acquire the right products and technologies.\nProducts and technologies that we license or acquire may require additional development prior to sale, including clinical testing and approval by the FDA and other regulatory bodies, and we may encounter difficulties or delays in completing the development or receiving the necessary approvals. We may find that the product or technology cannot be manufactured economically or commercialized successfully. We may not be able to acquire or license the right to products on terms that we find acceptable, if at all.\nEven if we complete future acquisitions, our business, financial condition and the results of operations could be negatively affected because we may be unable to integrate the acquired business or products successfully and realize anticipated economic, operational and other benefit in a timely manner; and/or the acquisition may disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management team and divert our resources\nProduct liability claims could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe manufacture and sale of our products exposes us to significant risk of product liability claims, some of which may have a negative impact on our business. Any defects or risks that we have not yet identified with our products may give rise to product liability claims. Our existing worldwide product liability insurance coverage of up to $10 million in liability may be inadequate to protect us from liabilities we may incur. We may also not be able to maintain adequate product liability insurance at acceptable rates. If a product liability claim (or series of claims) would be brought against us for uninsured liabilities or in excess of our insurance coverage, and ultimately it is determined that we are liable, our business could suffer. Additionally, we could experience a material design or manufacturing failure in our products, a quality system failure, other safety issues or heightened regulatory scrutiny that would warrant a recall of some of our products. A recall of any of our products likely would be costly, would be uninsured and could also result in increased product liability claims. Further, while we train our physician customers in the proper use of our products, we cannot be certain that they will implement our instructions accurately. If our products are used incorrectly by our customers, injury may result and this could give rise to product liability claims against us.\nProduct quality problems could lead to reduced revenue, gross margins and net income.\nWe produce highly complex videoscope products that incorporate sophisticated technology, including hardware and software. Software typically contains bugs that can unexpectedly interfere with operations. Our quality assurance testing programs may not be adequate to detect all defects, either ones in individual products or ones that could affect numerous shipments, which might interfere with customer satisfaction, reduce sales opportunities, increase warranty repairs, or reduce gross margins. In the past, we have had to replace certain components and provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects or bugs in products that it had shipped. There can be no assurance that such a remediation, depending on the product involved, would not have a material impact. An inability to cure a product defect could result in the failure of a product line, a product recall, temporary or permanent withdrawal of a product from a market, damage to our reputation, inventory costs or product reengineering expenses, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our revenue, margins, and net income.\nWe expect gross margins to vary over time, and our level of product gross margins may not be sustainable.\nThe current levels of our product gross margins may not be sustainable and may continue to be adversely affected by numerous factors, including:\n\u25cf obsolescence of components or products due to sales trends and new product introductions;\n\u25cf our inability to reduce supply and production costs;\n\u25cf increases in material or labor costs;\n\u25cf changes in shipment volume;\n\u25cf loss of cost savings due to changes in component pricing, including the impact of foreign exchange rates for components purchased overseas;\n\u25cf changes in distribution channels;\n\u25cf increased warranty costs; and\n\u25cf the uncertainty of the timing and amounts for recognizing our specified margin of Stryker\u2019s gross profit after Stryker sells the products to their end customers.\nThe use and acceptance of certain of our products depends heavily upon the availability of third-party reimbursement for the procedures in which our products are used.\nIn the U.S., healthcare providers that purchase medical devices, including our products, generally rely on third-party payers, including Medicare, Medicaid, private health insurance carriers and managed care organizations, to reimburse all or part of the cost and fees associated with the procedures performed using these devices. The commercial success of our products will depend on the ability of healthcare providers to obtain adequate reimbursement from third-party payers for the procedures in which our products are used. Third-party payers are more frequently challenging the coverage and pricing of medical products and procedures.\nEven if a procedure is eligible for reimbursement, the level of reimbursement may not be adequate to justify the use of our products. In addition, third-party payers may deny reimbursement if they determine that the device used in the treatment was not cost-effective or was used for a non-approved indication, particularly if there is not a published Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT, code for reimbursement. For example, in 2009, the American Medical Association advised the medical community that the previously recommended Category 1 CPT code for percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation, or PTNS, treatments should be replaced with an unlisted code. As a result, many third-party insurers delayed or denied reimbursement for PTNS treatments, significantly impacting the sales of our Urgent PC System, until a new code was effective in January 2011.\nReimbursement and healthcare payment systems in international markets vary significantly by country, with some countries offering government-sponsored healthcare or private insurance, or both. In many countries where there is government-sponsored healthcare reimbursement, decisions are made by individual hospitals with the government setting an upper limit of reimbursement. In most foreign countries, there are also insurance systems that may offer payments for alternative procedures. We cannot be certain that we, or in countries in which we work with our distributors, those distributors, will successfully and cost-effectively manage all of these payment systems.\nAll third-party reimbursement programs, whether government-funded or insured commercially, inside the U.S. or outside, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling health care costs through prospective reimbursement and capitation programs, group purchasing, redesign of benefit, second opinions, careful review of bills, encouragement of healthier lifestyles and exploration of more cost-effective methods of delivering healthcare. These types of programs can potentially limit the amount that healthcare providers may be willing to pay for medical devices and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe cannot predict how quickly or how broadly the market will accept our products.\nIn addition to the availability of third-party reimbursement, market acceptance of our products will depend on our ability to demonstrate the safety, clinical efficacy, perceived benefit, and cost-effectiveness of our products compared to products or treatment options of our competitors. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in educating the marketplace about the benefit of our products.\nWe may not have the resources to successfully market our products, which would adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe marketing of our products requires a significant amount of time and expense in order to identify the physicians who would use our products and to train a sales force that is large enough to interact with the targeted physicians. The ease and predictability of third-party reimbursement significantly impacts the success of our marketing activities. We may not have adequate resources to market our products successfully against larger competitors who have more resources than we do. If we cannot market our products successfully, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nIf we are not able to attract, retain and motivate our sales force and expand our distribution channels, our sales and revenues will suffer.\nIn the U.S., we have a sales organization consisting primarily of direct sales representatives, and a marketing organization to market our products directly and support our distributor organizations. We expect to expand our sales and marketing organization, as needed, to support our growth. We have and will continue to incur significant additional expenses to support this organization. We cannot be certain that our sales organization will be able to generate sales of our urology and endoscopy products at levels that justify our expense, or even if we can, that we will be able to recruit, train, motivate or retain qualified sales and marketing personnel.\nA significant portion of our revenue outside of the United States is through a network of independent distributors. Our ability to increase product sales in foreign markets will largely depend on our ability to develop and maintain relationships with our distributors and on their ability to successfully market and sell our products. We may not be able to retain distributors who are willing to commit the necessary resources to market and sell our products to the level of our expectations. Failure to maintain or expand our distribution channels or to recruit, retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our product sales and revenues.\nIn addition, we have a limited ability to direct or influence the activities of our third-party, independent distributors. Our distributors could take one or more of the following actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects and brand:\n\u25cf sell products that compete with our products in breach of their non-competition agreements with us;\n\u25cf fail to adequately promote our products; or\n\u25cf fail to provide proper service to our end users.\nIf we are unable to adequately manage our distribution network, or if our distributors fail to meet their obligations under their agreements with us, our corporate image among end users of our products could be damaged, resulting in a failure to meet our sales goals. In addition, foreign governments have increased their anti-bribery efforts in the healthcare sector to reduce improper payments received by hospital administrators and doctors in connection with the purchase of pharmaceutical products and medical devices. We are subject to the regulations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and are required to monitor our activities associated with our foreign sales. To our knowledge, none of our distributors engages in corrupt practices. However, our distributors may violate these laws or otherwise engage in illegal practices with respect to their sales or marketing of our products which would adversely affect our corporate image and business.\nOur distributors may not obtain regulatory approvals in a timely basis, if at all.\nWe often rely on our distributors in countries outside the U.S. in seeking regulatory approval to market our products in particular countries. To the extent we do so, we are dependent on persons outside of our direct control to make regulatory submissions and secure approvals, and we do not, and will not, have direct access to health care agencies in those markets to ensure timely regulatory approvals or prompt resolution of regulatory or compliance matters. If our distributors fail to obtain the required approvals or do not do so in a timely manner, our sales from our international operations and our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIf we cannot attract and retain our key personnel and management team, we may not be able to manage and operate successfully, and we may not be able to meet our strategic objectives.\nOur future success depends, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain and motivate our management team and key managerial, scientific, sales and technical personnel. Key personnel may depart because of difficulties with change or a desire not to remain with us. We are highly dependent on our senior management team, and any unanticipated loss or interruption of their services could significantly reduce our ability to meet our strategic objectives because, given the intense competition for senior management and other key personnel, it may not be possible for us to find appropriate replacement personnel should the need arise. The loss of a member of our senior management or our professional staff would require the remaining senior executive officers to divert immediate and substantial attention to seeking a replacement. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in retaining our current personnel or in hiring or retaining qualified personnel in the future. Loss of key personnel or the inability to hire or retain qualified personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate successfully. Further, our inability, if any, to enforce non-compete arrangements related to key personnel who have left the company could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf third parties claim that our products infringe upon their intellectual property rights, we may incur liabilities and costs and may have to redesign or discontinue selling the affected product.\nThe medical device industry is litigious with respect to patents and other intellectual property rights. Companies operating in our industry routinely seek patent protection for their product designs, and many of our principal competitors have large patent portfolios. Companies in the medical device industry have used intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage. Whether a product infringes a patent involves complex legal and factual issues, the determination of which is often uncertain and costly. We face the risk of claims that our products have infringed on third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights. Our efforts to identify and avoid infringing on third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights may not always be successful. Any claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement, even those without merit, could:\n\u25cf be expensive and time consuming for us to defend;\n\u25cf result in us being required to pay significant damages to third parties;\n\u25cf cause us to cease making or selling products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;\n\u25cf require us to redesign, reengineer or rebrand our products, if feasible;\n\u25cf require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a third party\u2019s intellectual property, which agreements may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all;\n\u25cf divert the attention of our management; or\n\u25cf result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchases or use of the affected products until resolution of the litigation.\nIn addition, new patents obtained by our competitors could threaten our products\u2019 continued life in the market even after it has already been introduced.\nIf we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, we may not be able to compete effectively.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to protect the proprietary rights to the technologies used in our products. We rely on patent protection, as well as a combination of trademark laws and confidentiality, noncompetition and other contractual arrangements to protect our proprietary technology. However, these legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep a competitive advantage. Our patents and patent applications, if issued, may not be broad enough to prevent competitors from introducing similar products into the market. Our patents, if challenged or if we attempt to enforce them, may not necessarily be upheld by the courts. In addition, patent protection in foreign countries may be different from patent protection under U.S. laws and may not be favorable to us.\nWe also rely on unpatented proprietary technology. We cannot assure you that we can meaningfully protect all of our rights in our unpatented proprietary technology or that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent products or processes or otherwise gain access to our unpatented proprietary technology. We attempt to protect our trade secrets and other unpatented proprietary technology through the use of confidentiality and noncompetition agreements with our current key employees and with other parties to whom we have divulged trade secrets. However, these agreements may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful protection for our proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure or other breaches of the agreements or in the event competitors discover or independently develop similar proprietary information.\nEfforts on our part to enforce any of our proprietary rights could be time-consuming and expensive, which could adversely affect our business and prospects and divert our management\u2019s attention.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we use our networks to collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, and data relating to patients who use our products. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations and the services we provide to our customers, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, which could adversely affect our operating margins, revenues and competitive position.\nThe loss or interruption of materials from any of our key suppliers could delay the manufacture of our products, which would limit our ability to generate sales and revenues.\nWe currently purchase several key materials used in our products from single source suppliers, including the finished products for our Urgent PC System. If one of these suppliers delayed or curtailed shipments to us, our ability to manufacture and deliver product would be impaired, our sales would decline or be curtailed for that product, and we would be forced to quickly locate an alternative source of supply. We cannot be sure that acceptable alternative arrangements could be made on a timely basis. Further, our reliance on such suppliers and the cost and difficulty we would encounter in qualifying an alternative subjects us to increased risk of price increase by single source suppliers. Additionally, the qualification of materials and processes as a result of a supplier change could be deemed as unacceptable to regulatory authorities and cause delays and increased costs due to additional test requirements. A significant interruption in the supply of materials, for any reason, could delay the manufacture and sale of our products, which would limit our ability to generate revenues.\nCertain components for our fiberscopes and videoscopes are generally only available from one source. Our inability to obtain any of these parts could delay or prevent us from making and selling products, which would have a material and adverse effect on our future financial condition and results of operations.\nOur borescopes are assembled using components and subassemblies purchased from independent vendors. While most components and subassemblies are currently available from more than one supplier, certain critical components are currently purchased only from limited key suppliers with which we do not have long or short term contracts. Our failure to obtain a sufficient quantity of such components on favorable terms could materially adversely affect the sales in our industrial business.\nOur medical products and manufacturing practices are subject to regulation by the FDA and by other state and foreign regulatory agencies.\nOur medical products are subject to extensive regulation in the U.S. and in the foreign countries where we do business. There can be no assurance that the required regulatory clearances will be obtained, and those obtained may include significant limitations on the uses of the product in question. In addition, changes in existing regulations or the adoption of new regulations could make our regulatory compliance more difficult in the future. The failure to obtain required regulatory clearances or to comply with applicable regulations may result in fines, delays, suspensions of clearances, seizures, recalls of products, operating restrictions or criminal prosecutions, and could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nIf we are not able to maintain sufficient quality controls, regulatory approvals of our products by the European Union, Canada, the FDA or other relevant authorities could be delayed or denied and our sales and revenues will suffer.\nThe FDA, European Union, Canada or other related authorities could stop or delay approval of production of products if our manufacturing facilities do not comply with applicable manufacturing requirements. The FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulations impose extensive testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements. Canada and the European Union also impose requirements on quality systems of manufacturers, who are inspected and certified on a periodic basis and may be subject to additional unannounced inspections. Further, our suppliers are also subject to these regulatory requirements. Failure by any of our suppliers or us to comply with these requirements could prevent us from obtaining or retaining approval and marketing of our products.\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our operating results.\nBecause some of our business includes international business transactions, costs and prices of our products or components in overseas countries are affected by foreign exchange rate changes. As a result, foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nCurrently, we do not have any foreign exchange forward contracts and we do not hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows.\nWe derive a significant portion of our sales from outside of the U.S. and are subject to the risks of international operations.\nWe derived approximately 25% of our net sales in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015 from customers and operations in international markets. The sale and shipping of our products and services across international borders, as well as the purchase of components and products from international sources, subject us to a number of risks, including:\n\u25cf the imposition of additional U.S. and foreign governmental controls or regulations;\n\u25cf the imposition of costly and lengthy export licensing requirements;\n\u25cf local political and economic instability;\n\u25cf fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies;\n\u25cf difficulties in recruiting and maintaining distributors and staff in remote locations, including sales people;\n\u25cf changes in duties and tariffs, license obligations and other non-tariff barriers to trade;\n\u25cf the imposition of new trade restrictions;\n\u25cf the imposition of restrictions on the activities of foreign agents, representatives and distributors;\n\u25cf foreign taxation compliance and penalties;\n\u25cf pricing pressure that we may experience internationally;\n\u25cf laws and business practices favoring local companies;\n\u25cf longer payment cycles;\n\u25cf difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems; and\n\u25cf difficulties in enforcing or defending intellectual property rights.\nWe cannot assure that one or more of these factors will not harm our business.\nFailure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could subject us to, among other things, penalties and legal expenses that could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe are required to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which generally prohibits covered entities and their intermediaries from engaging in bribery or making other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other benefit. In addition, the FCPA imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded U.S. corporations and their foreign affiliates, which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments, and to prevent the establishment of \u201coff books\u201d slush funds from which such improper payments can be made. We also are subject to similar anticorruption legislation implemented in Europe under the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development\u2019s Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions. We either operate or plan to operate in a number of jurisdictions that pose a high risk of potential violations of the FCPA and other anticorruption laws, and we utilize a number of distributors for whose actions we could be held liable under the FCPA and other anticorruption laws. We inform our personnel, distributors and agents of the requirements of the FCPA and other anticorruption laws, including, but not limited to their reporting requirements. We also have developed and will continue to develop and implement systems for formalizing contracting processes, performing due diligence on personnel, distributors and agents and improving our recordkeeping and auditing practices regarding these regulations. However, there is no guarantee that our personnel, distributors or agents have not or will not engage in conduct undetected by our processes and for which we might be held responsible under the FCPA or other anticorruption laws.\nIf our personnel, distributors or agents are found to have engaged in practices in violation of the FCPA or other anticorruption laws, we could suffer severe penalties, including criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other remedial measures, including further changes or enhancements to our procedures, policies and controls, as well as potential personnel changes and disciplinary actions. During the past few years, the SEC has increased our enforcement of violations of the FCPA against companies, including several medical device companies. Although we do not believe we are currently a target, any investigation of any potential violations of the FCPA or other anticorruption laws by U.S. or foreign authorities also could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nCertain foreign companies, including some of our competitors, are not subject to prohibitions as strict as those under the FCPA or, even if subjected to strict prohibitions, such prohibitions may be laxly enforced in practice. If our competitors engage in corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft or other fraudulent practices, they may receive preferential treatment from personnel of some companies, giving our competitors an advantage in securing business, or from government officials, who might give them priority in obtaining new licenses, which would put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nWe may attempt to acquire new products or technologies, and if we are unable to successfully complete these acquisitions or to integrate acquired businesses, products, technologies or employees, we may fail to realize expected benefit or harm our existing business.\nOur success will depend, in part, on our ability to expand our product offerings and grow our business in response to changing technologies, customer demands and competitive pressures. In some circumstances, we may seek to do so through the acquisition of complementary businesses, products or technologies rather than through internal development. The identification of suitable acquisition candidates and obtaining adequate financing can be difficult, time-consuming and/or costly, and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisitions. Furthermore, even if we successfully complete an acquisition, we may not be able to successfully integrate newly acquired organizations, products or technologies into our operations, and the process of integration could be expensive, and/or time-consuming and may strain our resources. Consequently, we may not achieve anticipated benefits of the acquisitions, which could harm our existing business. In addition, future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or expenses, or other charges such as in-process research and development, any of which could harm our business and affect our financial results or cause a reduction in the price of our common stock.\nIf we are not able to acquire or license other products, our business and future growth prospects could suffer.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we intend to acquire or license additional products and technologies for development and commercialization. The success of this strategy depends upon our ability to identify, select and acquire the right products and technologies.\nProducts and technologies that we license or acquire may require additional development prior to sale, including clinical testing and approval by the FDA and other regulatory bodies, and we may encounter difficulties or delays in completing the development or receiving the necessary approvals. We may find that the product or technology cannot be manufactured economically or commercialized successfully. We may not be able to acquire or license the right to products on terms that we find acceptable, if at all.\nEven if we complete future acquisitions, our business, financial condition and the results of operations could be negatively affected because we may be unable to integrate the acquired business or products successfully and realize anticipated economic, operational and other benefit in a timely manner and/or the acquisition may disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management team and divert our resources.\nOur corporate documents contain provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of the company.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition, even if our stockholders consider the terms favorable. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide for a staggered board of directors, requiring our directors to serve for three-year terms, with approximately one third of the directors standing for reelection each year. A staggered board could make it more difficult for a third party to obtain control of our board of directors through a proxy contest, which may be a necessary step in an acquisition of us that is not favored by our board of directors.\nOur officers and directors have the ability to exercise significant control over the company.\nAs of June 15, 2015, our officers and directors owned an aggregate of approximately 14.1% of outstanding shares of our common stock. Under a convertible note dated September 19, 2012, as amended (the \u201c2012 Note\u201d), Mr. Lewis C. Pell, a member of our Board of Directors, at his option at any time prior to maturity, but not until after three years following the effective date of the merger or, if earlier, three days prior to the record date for the declaration of any dividend or distribution on our common stock in cash or other property other than common stock , has the right to convert the unpaid principal balance, which was $20.0 million as of June 15, 2015, into 3,333,333 shares of our common stock. Under a convertible note dated September 25, 2013, as amended (the \u201c2013 Note\u201d), Mr. Pell, at his option at any time prior to maturity, but not until after three years following the effective date of the merger or, if earlier, three days prior to the record date for the declaration of any dividend or distribution on our common stock in cash or other property other than common stock, has the right to convert the unpaid principal balance, which was $3.5 million as of June 15, 2015, into additional 786,516 shares of our common stock. Under a convertible promissory note dated June 16, 2014 (the \u201c2014 Note\u201d), Mr. Pell, at his option has the right to convert the unpaid principal balance, which was $4.99 million as of June 15, 2015, into additional 899,099 shares of our common stock. Mr. Pell also has three warrants to purchase an aggregate of 376,123 shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $9.31 per share. The conversion of the 2012 Note, the 2013 Note and the 2014 Note and exercise of the warrants would increase the aggregate ownership of our officers and directors (assuming that our other directors and officers exercise their options) to approximately 34.2% of outstanding shares of our common stock as of June 15, 2015. As such, our directors and officers exercise significant control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the company or forcing management to change our operating strategies, which may be to the benefit of management but not in the interest of the stockholders.", "PERMNO": 90942, "SIC": 3842, "TIC": "CGNT"}
