RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock is subject to risks inherent to our business. The material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect us are described below. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Report. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair our business operations. This Report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.\nIf any of the following risks actually occurs, our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flow could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the value of our common stock could decline significantly, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nChanges in the general economy or the financial markets could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe provide traditional commercial, retail and mortgage banking services, as well as other financial services including wealth management and insurance brokerage services. Downturns in the United States or global economies or financial markets could adversely affect the demand for, or the availability of, loans and other products and services offered by us. The business environment in the U.S. has experienced volatility in recent years and may continue to do so for the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance that economic conditions will not worsen. Difficult economic conditions could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in economic conditions of local markets where conduct business could adversely affect our operations.\nMaine\nThe Company\u2019s success is dependent on the local economies of downeast, midcoast and central Maine as a significant portion of our loan portfolio is concentrated among borrowers in these markets. Furthermore, because a substantial portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate in these areas, the value of the associated collateral is also subject to regional real estate market conditions.\nA number of our hospitality and other customers rely upon a high number of visits from tourists and vacationers to Acadia National Park as a significant part of their businesses. Prolonged interruptions or shutdowns in the operation of tourist destination sites within our market areas could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nNew Hampshire and Vermont\nWith the acquisition of Lake Sunapee Bank Group, we are now exposed to the local market conditions and economies of Cheshire, Grafton, Hillsborough, Merrimack and Sullivan counties in central and western New Hampshire and in Rutland, Windsor and Orange counties in central Vermont. Future growth\nopportunities depend on the growth and stability of the regional economy and our ability to expand our market area. A downturn in the local economy may limit funds available for deposit and may negatively affect borrowers\u2019 ability to repay their loans on a timely basis, both of which could have an impact on our profitability and business.\nUnsuccessful acquisition and geographic expansion could negatively impact earnings\nThe Company recently expanded into the New Hampshire and Vermont markets with the acquisition of Lake Sunapee Bank Group. Success of the acquisition is dependent on the integration of the combined company infrastructure, culture, and acceptance of customer within these new markets. Profitability is dependent on management\u2019s ability to maintain employee and customer relationships, improve operational efficiencies and grow profits at a rate that exceeds the growth of expenses. To the extent that the Company acquires other companies, its business may be negatively impacted by certain risks inherent with such acquisitions.\nInterest rate volatility could significantly reduce the Company\u2019s profitability.\nThe Bank\u2019s earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon its net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest-bearing assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the Company\u2019s control, including general economic conditions, demand for loans, securities and deposits, and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect (i) our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, (ii) the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities, and (iii) the average duration of our loans and securities that are collateralized by mortgages. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, our net interest income, and therefore\nearnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. If interest rates decline, the Bank\u2019s higher-rate loans and investments may be subject to prepayment risk, which could negatively impact its net interest margin. Conversely, if interest rates increase, the Bank\u2019s loans and investment securities may be subject to extension risk, which could negatively impact its net interest margin as well.\nHigh concentrations of commercial loans may increase exposure to credit loss upon borrower default\nAs of December 31, 2016, approximately 49% of the Banks\u2019s loan portfolio consisted of commercial real estate, commercial and industrial, construction and agricultural loans. Commercial loan portfolio concentration generally exposes lenders to greater risk of delinquency and loss than residential real estate loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation and income streams from the property. Additionally, commercial loans typically involve larger balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to residential real estate loans. Because the Bank\u2019s loan portfolio contains a significant number of large commercial loans, the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in nonperforming loans, provision for loan losses, and/or an increase in loan charge-offs, all of which could adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.\nGreater than anticipated credit losses in the loan portfolios may adversely affect earnings.\nCredit losses are inherent in the business of making loans and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio and provide an allowance for loan losses based on a number of factors. We evaluate the allowance for loan losses on a periodic basis using current information, including the quality of the loan portfolio, economic conditions, and the value of the underlying collateral and the level of non-accrual loans. Although we believe the allowance for loan losses is appropriate to absorb probable losses in our loan portfolio, this allowance may not be adequate. Increases in the allowance will result in an expense for the period, thereby reducing our reported net income.\nStrong competition within our markets may significantly impact the Company\u2019s profitability.\nThe Company competes with an ever-increasing array of financial service providers. See the section entitled \u201cCompetition\u201d of Item 1 of this Form 10-K for additional information about our competitors. Competition from nationwide banks, as well as local institutions, continues to mount in our markets.\nRegional, national and international competitors have far greater assets and capitalization than we do and have greater access to capital markets and can offer a broader array of financial services than we can. For example, consumers can maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts or mutual funds. Consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and/or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as \u201cdisintermediation,\u201d could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. Further, many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. Additionally, due to their size, many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than we can.\nTo compete, the Company focuses on quality customer service, making decisions at the local level, maintaining long-term customer relationships, building customer loyalty, and providing products and services designed to address the specific needs of customers. Failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s growth and profitability.\nNew regulations could restrict residential lending activities.\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\"CFPB\") issued a rule designed to clarify for lenders how they can avoid monetary damages under the Dodd-Frank Act, which would hold lenders accountable for ensuring a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a mortgage. Loans that meet this \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d definition will be presumed to have complied with the new ability-to-repay standard. The CFPB\u2019s rule on qualified mortgages could limit the Banks's ability or desire to make certain types of loans or loans to certain borrowers, or could make it more expensive and/or time consuming to make these loans, which could limit growth or profitability. CFPB rules on other types of consumer lending could similarly affect the cost and profitability of those lending activities.\nThe Company is subject to extensive government regulation and supervision, which may interfere with our ability to conduct our business and may negatively impact our financial results.\nThe Company is subject to extensive government regulation and supervision, which may interfere with our ability to conduct our business and may negatively impact our financial results. The Bank and certain non-bank subsidiaries, are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors\u2019 funds, the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund and the safety and soundness of the banking system as a whole, not stockholders. These regulations affect the Company\u2019s lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things. Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. Changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations or policies, could affect the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject the Company to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products the Company may offer, and/or limit the pricing the Company may charge on certain banking services, among other things. Compliance personnel and resources may increase our costs of operations and adversely impact our earnings.\nFailure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. While the Company has policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations, there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur.\nThe Company may elect or be compelled to seek additional capital in the future, but capital may not be available when it is needed.\nThe Company is required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support its operations. In addition, the Company may elect to raise additional capital to support its business or to finance acquisitions, if any, or the Company may otherwise elect to raise additional capital.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions, and a number of other factors, many of which are outside the Company\u2019s control, and on its financial performance. Accordingly, we cannot be assured of our Company\u2019s ability to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to us. If the Company cannot raise additional capital when needed, or on reasonable terms, it may have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Bank may not be able to meet its cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost, and its cost of funds for banking operations may significantly increase as a result of general economic conditions, interest rates, and competitive pressures.\nLiquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost. The liquidity of the Bank is used to make loans and to repay deposit and borrowing liabilities as they become due, or are demanded by customers and creditors. Many factors affect the Bank\u2019s ability to meet liquidity needs, including variations in the markets served by its network of offices, its mix of assets and liabilities, reputation and standing in the marketplace, and general economic conditions.\nThe Bank\u2019s primary source of funding is retail deposits, gathered throughout its network of banking offices. Wholesale funding sources principally consist of secured borrowing lines from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (the \u201cFHLB\u201d) of which it is a member, secured borrowing lines from the FRB of Boston, and certificates of deposit obtained from the national market. The Bank\u2019s securities and loan portfolios provide a source of contingent liquidity that could be accessed in a reasonable time period through sales.\nSignificant changes in general economic conditions, market interest rates, competitive pressures or otherwise, could cause the Bank\u2019s deposits to decrease relative to overall banking operations, and it would have to rely more heavily on brokered funds and borrowings in the future, which are typically more expensive than deposits.\nChanges in economic conditions, including consumer savings habits and availability or access to the brokered deposit market could potentially have a significant impact on the Bank\u2019s liquidity position, which in turn could materially impact its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company is subject to a variety of operational risks, including reputational risk, legal risk, and compliance risk, and the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe Company is exposed to many types of operational risks, including reputational risk, legal and compliance risk, the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, and unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors, including clerical or record-keeping errors or those resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems.\nIf personal, non-public, confidential, or proprietary information of customers in our possession were to be mishandled or misused, we could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage, and financial loss.\nBecause the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and successfully rectified. The Company\u2019s necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process transactions and its large transaction volume may further increase the risk that technical flaws or employee tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect. The Company may also be subject to disruptions\nof its operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond its control (i.e., computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages, natural disaster, disease pandemics, or other damage to property or physical assets), which may give rise to disruption of service to customers and to financial loss or liability. The Company is further exposed to the risk that its external vendors may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations (or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors by their respective employees as we are) and to the risk that our (or our vendors\u2019) business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate. The occurrence of any of these risks could result in a diminished ability to operate our business (i.e., by requiring us to expend significant resources to correct the defect), as well as potential liability to clients, reputational damage, and regulatory intervention.\nDisruptions to the Company\u2019s information systems and security breaches could adversely affect its business and reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company relies on electronic communications and information systems to conduct its businesses and to store sensitive data, including financial information regarding its customers. The integrity of information systems are under significant threat from cyber-attacks by third parties, including through coordinated attacks sponsored by foreign nations and criminal organizations to disrupt business operations and other compromises to data and systems for political or criminal purposes. The Company employs an in-depth, layered, defense approach that leverages people, processes and technology to manage and maintain cyber security controls. Notwithstanding the strength of our defensive measures, the threat from cyberattacks is severe, attacks are sophisticated and attackers respond rapidly to changes in defensive measures. Cyber security risks may also occur with the Company\u2019s third-party service providers, and may interfere with their ability to fulfill their contractual obligations to us, with additional potential for financial loss or liability that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition or results of operations. The Company offers its customers the ability to bank remotely and provide other technology based products and services, which services include the secure transmission of confidential information over the Internet and other remote channels. To the extent that the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 systems are not secure or are otherwise compromised, its network could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, malicious software, phishing schemes and other security breaches. To the extent that the Company\u2019 activities or the activities of its clients or third-party service providers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches and malicious software could expose the Company to claims, regulatory scrutiny, litigation and other possible liabilities.\nWhile to date the Company has not experienced a significant compromise, significant data loss or material financial losses related to cyber security attacks, the Company\u2019s systems and those of its clients and third-party service providers are under constant threat and we may experience a significant event in the future. The Company may suffer material financial losses related to these risks in the future or it may be subject to liability for compromises to its client or third-party service provider systems. Any such losses or liabilities could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition or results of operations, and could expose us to reputation risk, the loss of client business, increased operational costs, as well as additional regulatory scrutiny, possible litigation, and related financial liability. These risks also include possible business interruption, including the inability to access critical information and systems.\nThe Company continually encounters technological change.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. The Company\u2019s future success depends, in part, upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in\ntechnological improvements. The Company may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers.\nThe Company is subject to possible claims and litigation pertaining to fiduciary responsibilities.\nFrom time to time, customers make claims and take legal action pertaining to the Company\u2019s performance of its fiduciary responsibilities. Whether customer claims and legal action related to our performance of our fiduciary responsibilities are founded or unfounded, if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to us, they may result in significant financial liability and/or adversely affect the market perception of our Company and our products and services as well as impact customer demand for our products and services.\nTax law changes may adversely affect the Company\u2019s net income, effective tax rate, and its overall results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s financial performance is impacted by federal and state tax laws. The enactment of proposed U.S. tax reforms could materially adversely affect us, including as a result of a reduction in the value of our DTAs upon a reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate. We cannot predict if any such proposals will ultimately become law, or, if enacted, what its provisions or that of the regulations promulgated thereunder will be, but they could materially adversely affect our financial position and our results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented.\nThe Company regularly reviews and updates its internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met.\nThe Company\u2019s access to funds from subsidiaries may be restricted.\nBar Harbor Bankshares is a separate and distinct legal entity from our Bank and nonbanking subsidiaries. Bar Harbor Bankshares depends on dividends, distributions and other payments from its banking and nonbanking subsidiaries to fund dividend payments on its common stock and to fund all payments on its other obligations. The Company\u2019s subsidiaries are subject to laws that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to Bar Harbor Bankshares, which could impede access to funds it needs to make payments on its obligations or dividend payments.\nThe Company may be unable to attract and retain key personnel.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key personnel. Competition for qualified personnel in the financial services industry can be intense and the Company and its subsidiaries may not be able to hire or retain the key personnel that it depends upon for success. In addition, the Bank\u2019s rural geographic marketplace, combined with relatively expensive real estate purchase prices within the area of the Bank\u2019s principal office location in Bar Harbor, Maine, create additional risks for the Company and the Bank\u2019s ability to attract and retain key personnel. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of the our key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills, knowledge of the markets in which we operate, years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.\nThe Bank is exposed to risk of environmental liabilities with respect to properties to which it takes title.\nIn the course of our business, the Bank may own or foreclose and take title to real estate, and could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. We may be held liable to a\ngovernmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination, or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances, or chemical releases at a property. The cost associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, as the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, and other external events could significantly impact the Company\u2019s business and the business of its customers.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our Company\u2019s ability to conduct business. Such events could affect the stability of our borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause us to incur additional expenses. In particular, such events may have a particularly negative impact upon the business of our customers who are engaged in the hospitality and natural resource dependent industries in our market area, which could have a direct negative impact on our Company\u2019s business and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 85332, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "BHB"}
