{"cik": "934547", "company": "BANK OF KENTUCKY FINANCIAL CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\tRisk Factors\nAn investment in the Common Stock of BKFC is subject to certain risks inherent in the business of BKFC and the Bank. The material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect BKFC and the Bank are described below. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference into this Annual Report. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing BKFC or the Bank. Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair the business operations of BKFC or the Bank. This Annual Report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.\nIf any of the following risks occur, or if any combination of the following risks occur, the financial condition and results of operations of BKFC or the Bank could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the value of Common Stock could decline significantly.\nReferences to \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d and \u201cour\u201d in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section refer to BKFC and its subsidiaries, including the Bank, unless otherwise specified or unless the context otherwise requires.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur business depends upon the general economic conditions of the northern Kentucky and greater Cincinnati, Ohio area, and may continue to be adversely affected by downturns in the local economies in which we operate.\nOur business operations are limited almost exclusively to the northern Kentucky and the greater Cincinnati, Ohio area, which is a small geographic area. As such, our business is closely tied to the general economic conditions of this area. Local economic conditions in this area have a significant impact on the demand for our products and services, as well as the ability of our customers to repay loans, the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of the Bank\u2019s deposit funding sources.\nA significant decline in general economic conditions could increase loan delinquencies, increase problem assets and foreclosure, increase claims and lawsuits, decrease the demand for the Bank\u2019s products and services, or decrease the value of collateral for loans, especially real estate, in turn reducing customers\u2019 borrowing power and the value of assets associated with problem loans and collateral coverage, thereby having a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our loans are secured by real estate and concentrated in the northern Kentucky and greater Cincinnati area, which may adversely affect our earnings and capital if real estate values decline.\nNearly 80% of our total loans are real estate interests (residential, nonresidential including both owner-occupied and investment real estate, and construction and land development) concentrated in the northern Kentucky area and neighboring areas in greater Cincinnati, Ohio, a small geographic area. As a result, declining real estate values in the northern Kentucky and greater Cincinnati, Ohio markets as a result of the ongoing national economic recession could negatively impact the value of the real estate collateral securing such loans. If we are required to liquidate a significant amount of collateral during a period of reduced real estate values in satisfaction of any non-performing or defaulted loans, our earnings and capital could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to intense competition in our market area, and our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to compete effectively.\nBKFC and the Bank compete with national financial institutions, as well as numerous state chartered banking institutions of comparable or larger size and resources, smaller community banking organizations and a variety of nonbank competitors. The Bank competes for deposits with other commercial banks, savings associations and credit unions and with the issuers of commercial paper and other securities, such as shares in money market mutual funds. In making loans, the Bank competes with other banks, savings associations, consumer finance companies, credit unions, leasing companies and other lenders. Many of the institutions against whom we compete are national and regional banks that are significantly larger than us and, therefore, have significantly greater resources and the ability to achieve economies of scale by offering a broader range of products and services at more competitive prices than we can offer. We expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry.\nOur ability to compete successfully and to maintain and grow our profitability depends upon a number of factors, including: the ability to develop, maintain and build upon long-term customer relationships based on top-quality service, high ethical standards and safe, sound assets; the ability to continue to expand BKFC\u2019s market position through organic growth and strategic acquisitions; the scope, relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands; the rate at which BKFC introduces new products and services relative to our competitors; and industry and general economic trends. Failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position, which could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur nonresidential real estate loans expose us to greater risks of nonpayment and loss than residential mortgage loans, which may cause us to increase our allowance for loan losses which would reduce our net income.\nAt December 31, 2014, $593 million, or 47%, of our loan portfolio consisted of nonresidential real estate loans. Nonresidential real estate loans generally expose a lender to greater risk of non-payment and loss than residential mortgage loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation of the property and the income stream of the borrowers. Such loans expose us to additional risks because they typically are made on the basis of the borrower\u2019s ability to make repayments from the cash flow of the borrower\u2019s business and are secured by collateral that may depreciate over time. These loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to residential mortgage loans. Because such loans generally entail greater risk than residential mortgage loans, we may need to increase our allowance for loan losses in the future to account for the likely increase in probable incurred credit losses associated with the growth of such loans, which would reduce our net income. Also, many of our nonresidential real estate borrowers have more than one loan outstanding with us. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a residential mortgage loan.\nA decline in general economic conditions could require additions to our allowance for loan losses, which would reduce our net income.\nIf our borrowers do not repay their loans or if the collateral securing their loans is insufficient to provide for the full repayment, we may suffer credit losses. Credit losses are inherent in the lending business and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio and provide an allowance for loan losses based on a number of factors. If our assumptions and judgments are wrong, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover our losses. If we determine that our allowance for loan losses is insufficient, we would be required to take additional provisions for loan losses, which would reduce net income during the period those provisions are taken. In addition, our regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses or to charge off particular loans. If current economic trends change, we may experience higher than normal delinquencies and credit losses, resulting in increases to our provisions for loan losses again in the future and reduced net income. Not all TDR\u2019s are successful and may result in a higher allowance if they are evaluated on a collateral dependency basis.\nOur accounting policies and estimates are critical to how we report our financial condition and results of operations, and any changes to such accounting policies and estimates could materially affect how we report our financial condition and results of operations.\nAccounting policies and estimates are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Our management makes judgments and assumptions in selecting and adopting various accounting policies and in applying estimates so that such policies and estimates comply with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d).\nManagement has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require management\u2019s judgment to ascertain the valuations of assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies. A variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset, valuing an asset or liability or reducing a liability. We have established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure that these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently. In addition, these policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. Because of the uncertainty surrounding our judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters, actual outcomes may be materially different from amounts previously estimated. For example, because of the inherent uncertainty of estimates, management cannot provide any assurance that the Bank will not significantly increase its allowance for loan losses if actual losses are more than the amount reserved. Any increase in its allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we cannot guarantee that we will not be required to adjust accounting policies or restate prior financial statements. See \u201cAllowance for Loan Losses\u201d under \u201cItem 1. Business\u201d and \u201cCritical Accounting Policies\u201d under \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d for additional discussion regarding these critical accounting policies.\nFurther, from time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board and SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. The ongoing economic recession has resulted in increased scrutiny of accounting standards by legislators and our regulators, particularly as they relate to fair value accounting principles. In addition, ongoing efforts to achieve convergence between GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards may result in changes to GAAP. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in our restating prior period financial statements or otherwise adversely affecting our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur largest source of revenue (net interest income) is subject to interest rate risk.\nThe Bank\u2019s financial condition and results of operations are significantly affected by changes in interest rates. The Bank\u2019s earnings depend primarily upon its net interest income, which is the difference between its interest income earned on its interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and its interest expense paid on its interest-bearing liabilities, consisting of deposits and borrowings. Moreover, the loans included in our interest-earning assets are primarily comprised of variable and adjustable rate loans. Net interest income is subject to interest rate risk in the following ways:\n\u00b7 In general, for a given change in interest rates, the amount of change in value (positive or negative) is larger for assets and liabilities with longer remaining maturities. The shape of the yield curve may affect new loan yields, funding costs and investment income differently.\n\u00b7 The remaining maturity of various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as payment behavior changes in response to changes in interest rates. For example, if interest rates decline sharply, loans may pre-pay, or pay down, faster than anticipated, thus reducing future cash flows and interest income. Conversely, if interest rates increase, depositors may cash in their certificates of deposit prior to maturity (notwithstanding any applicable early withdrawal penalties) or otherwise reduce their deposits to pursue higher yielding investment alternatives.\n\u00b7 Re-pricing frequencies and maturity profiles for assets and liabilities may occur at different times. For example, in a falling rate environment, if assets re-price faster than liabilities, there will be an initial decline in earnings. Moreover, if assets and liabilities re-price at the same time, they may not be by the same increment. For instance, if the Federal Funds Rate increased 50 basis points, rates on demand deposits may rise by 10 basis points; whereas rates on prime-based loans will instantly rise 50 basis points.\nFinancial instruments do not respond in a parallel fashion to rising or falling interest rates. This causes asymmetry in the magnitude of changes to net interest income, net economic value and investment income resulting from the hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates. Therefore, BKFC\u2019s management monitors interest rate risk and adjusts BKFC\u2019s funding strategies to mitigate adverse effects of interest rate shifts on BKFC\u2019s balance sheet. The Bank\u2019s asset and liability management strategies designed to maintain a reasonable degree of interest rate sensitivity are more fully described in \u201cAsset/Liability Management\u201d under \u201cItem 1. Business\u201d and \u201cAsset/Liability Management and Market Risk\u201d under \u201cItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk\u201d.\nLegislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future may significantly affect BKFC\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or stock price.\nThere have been numerous actions undertaken in Congress, the Treasury Department, the FRB, the FDIC, the SEC and others in an effort to address the liquidity and credit crisis in the financial industry that followed the sub-prime mortgage market meltdown, which began in late 2007. These measures include the TARP CPP (under which the Treasury Department\u2019s authority to make new investments expired on October 3, 2010); homeowner relief that encourages loan restructuring and modification; the establishment of significant liquidity and credit facilities for financial institutions and investment banks; the lowering of the federal funds rate; emergency action against short selling practices; a temporary guaranty program for money market funds; the establishment of a commercial paper funding facility to provide back-stop liquidity to commercial paper issuers; a mandatory \u201cstress test\u201d requirement for banking institutions with assets in excess of $100 billion to analyze capital sufficiency and risk exposure; and coordinated international efforts to address illiquidity and other weaknesses in the banking sector. The purpose of these legislative and regulatory actions was to help stabilize the U.S. banking system. However, these and any current or future legislative or regulatory initiatives may not have their desired effect, or may have an adverse effect when applied to BKFC.\nThe most recent of these actions was the passage into law on July 21, 2010 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act represents a significant overhaul of many aspects of the regulation of the financial-services industry, addressing, among other things, systemic risk, capital adequacy, deposit insurance assessments, consumer financial protection, interchange fees, derivatives, lending limits, and changes among the bank regulatory agencies. Many of these provisions are subject to further study, rulemaking and to the discretion of regulatory bodies.\nWhile many of the provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act are aimed at financial institutions that are significantly larger than BKFC or the Bank, there are provisions with which we will have to comply now that the Dodd-Frank Act has become law. For instance, we will be subject to a new assessment model from the FDIC based on assets, not deposits, and be subject to enhanced executive compensation and corporate governance requirements. Because many aspects of this legislation remain subject to ongoing agency rulemaking, including public comment periods prior to implementation, it is difficult to predict at this time the complete extent of the effects that the Dodd-Frank Act will have on us. As rules and regulations are promulgated by the federal agencies responsible for implementing and enforcing the provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act, we will have to work to apply resources to ensure that we are in compliance with all applicable provisions, which may adversely impact our earnings. Furthermore, any current or future legislative or regulatory initiatives may not have their desired effect, or may have an adverse effect when applied to us.\nFailure to meet any of the various capital adequacy guidelines which we are subject to could adversely affect our operations and could compromise the status of BKFC as a bank holding company.\nBKFC and the Bank are required to meet certain regulatory capital adequacy guidelines and other regulatory requirements imposed by the FRB, the FDIC and the Department. If BKFC or the Bank fails to meet these minimum capital guidelines and other regulatory requirements, our financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected and could compromise the status of BKFC as a banking holding company. See \u201cRegulatory Capital Requirements\u201d under \u201cItem 1. Business\u201d for detailed capital guidelines for bank holding companies and banks.\nNon-compliance with applicable laws and/or regulations, including the Bank Secrecy Act and USA Patriot Act, may adversely affect BKFC\u2019s operations and financial results and could result in significant fines or sanctions.\nFederal and state regulators have the ability to impose substantial sanctions, restrictions and requirements on the Bank if they determine, upon examination or otherwise, that we have violated laws or regulations with which we must comply, or that weaknesses or failures exist with respect to general standards of safety and soundness. Such enforcement may be formal or informal and can include, among other things, orders to take certain actions or to refrain from certain actions. The imposition of regulatory sanctions may have adverse effects on BKFC, including a material impact on its financial condition. In addition, compliance with any such action could distract management\u2019s attention from operations, cause significant expenses, restrict BKFC from engaging in potentially profitable activities, and limit BKFC\u2019s ability to raise capital.\nThe USA Patriot and Bank Secrecy Acts require financial institutions to develop programs to prevent the institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If certain activities are detected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the Treasury Department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These rules also require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts or conduct transactions, and require the filing of certain reports, such as those for cash transactions above a certain threshold. Financial institutions must also refrain from transacting business with certain countries or persons designated by the Office of Foreign Assets Control.\nNon-compliance with laws and regulations such as these could result in significant fines or sanctions. These particular laws and regulations have significant implications for all financial institutions, establish new crimes and penalties, and require the federal banking agencies, in reviewing merger and acquisition transactions, to consider the effectiveness of the parties to such transactions in combating money laundering and terrorist activities. Even inadvertent non-compliance and technical failure to follow the regulations may result in significant fines or other penalties, which could have a material adverse impact on BKFC\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nThe value of the securities in our investment securities portfolio may be negatively affected by continued disruptions in securities markets.\nDue to heightened credit and liquidity risks and the volatile economy, making the determination of the value of a securities portfolio is less certain. There can be no assurance that decline in market value associated with these disruptions will not result in other-than-temporary or permanent impairments of these assets, which would lead to accounting charges which could have a material negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Bank could be held responsible for environmental liabilities relating to properties acquired through foreclosure, resulting in significant financial loss.\nIn the event the Bank forecloses on a defaulted commercial or residential mortgage loan to recover its investment, it may be subject to environmental liabilities in connection with the underlying real property, which could significantly exceed the value of the real property. Although the Bank exercises due diligence to discover potential environmental liabilities prior to acquiring any property through foreclosure, hazardous substances or wastes, contaminants, pollutants or their sources may be discovered on properties during its ownership or after a sale to a third party. BKFC cannot assure you that the Bank would not incur full recourse liability for the entire cost of any removal and cleanup on an acquired property, that the cost of removal and cleanup would not exceed the value of the property or that the Bank could recover any of the costs from any third party. Losses arising from environmental liabilities could have a material adverse impact on BKFC\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nBKFC is subject to liquidity risk, which could disrupt our ability to meet our financial obligations.\nLiquidity refers to the ability of BKFC to ensure sufficient levels of cash to fund operations, such as meeting deposit withdrawals, funding loan commitments, paying expenses and meeting quarterly payment obligations under certain subordinated debentures issued by BKFC in connection with the issuance of floating rate redeemable trust preferred securities issued by BKFC\u2019s unconsolidated trust subsidiary. The source of the funds for BKFC\u2019s debt obligations is dependent on the Bank. If needed, the Bank has the ability to borrow term and overnight funds from the FHLB or other financial intermediaries. The Bank also has $341 million of securities designated as available-for-sale that can serve as sources of funds as of December 31, 2014.\nWhile management is satisfied that BKFC\u2019s liquidity is sufficient at December 31, 2014 to meet known and potential obligations, any significant restriction or disruption of BKFC\u2019s ability to obtain funding from these or other sources could have a negative effect on BKFC\u2019s ability to satisfy its current and future financial obligations, which could materially affect BKFC\u2019s financial condition.\nBKFC is a bank holding company, and its sources of funds are limited.\nBKFC is a bank holding company and its operations are primarily conducted by the Bank, which is subject to significant federal and state regulation. Cash available to pay dividends to shareholders of BKFC is derived primarily from dividends paid by the Bank. As a result, BKFC\u2019s ability to receive dividends or loans from its subsidiaries is restricted. Under federal law, the payment of dividends by the Bank is subject to capital adequacy requirements. The FRB and/or the FDIC prohibit a dividend payment by BKFC or the Bank that would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. See \u201cDividend Restrictions\u201d under \u201cItem 1. Business\u201d.\nThe inability of the Bank to generate profits and pay such dividends to BKFC, or regulator restrictions on the payment of such dividends to BKFC even if earned, would have an adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of BKFC and BKFC\u2019s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders.\nIn addition, since BKFC is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank, its right to participate in the distribution of assets of the Bank upon the Bank\u2019s liquidation, reorganization or otherwise will be subject to the prior claims of the Bank\u2019s creditors, which will generally take priority over the Bank\u2019s shareholders.\nOur Common Stock price can be volatile.\nOur Common Stock price can fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors, making it more difficult for you to resell your Common Stock at prices you find attractive and at the time you want. Factors include actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results; changes in recommendations or projections by securities analysts; operating and stock price performance of other companies deemed to be peers; news reports and perception in the marketplace regarding BKFC, our competitors and/or the financial services industry as a whole; results of litigation; significant acquisitions or business combinations involving BKFC or our competitors; and other factors, including those described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nIn addition, our Common Stock also has a low average daily trading volume, which limits a person\u2019s ability to quickly accumulate or quickly divest themselves of large blocks of our Common Stock. Further, a low average trading volume can lead to significant price swings even when a relatively small number of shares are being traded.\nRecent or future acquisitions by BKFC may not produce revenue enhancements or cost savings at levels or within timeframes originally anticipated and may result in unforeseen integration difficulties.\nBKFC regularly explores opportunities to acquire financial services businesses or assets and may also consider opportunities to acquire other banks or financial institutions. In 2007, we acquired FNB Bancorporation. In 2009, we acquired certain banking offices and assumed certain deposit liabilities of Integra Bank, as well as adding the investment professionals of TAM to the Bank\u2019s trust department. In 2011, we completed the purchase of one banking office of United Kentucky Bank in Falmouth, Kentucky and a portfolio of selected loans. Difficulty in integrating an acquired business or company such as those described above or other businesses we acquire in the future may cause BKFC not to realize expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits. The integration could result in higher than expected customer deposit attrition (run-off), loss of key employees, disruption of BKFC\u2019s business or the business of the acquired company, or otherwise adversely affect BKFC\u2019s ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. Also, the negative effect of any divestitures required by regulatory authorities in acquisitions or business combinations may be greater than expected.\nSome provisions contained in BKFC\u2019s articles of incorporation and bylaws and under Kentucky law could deter a takeover attempt or delay changes in control or management of BKFC.\nCertain provisions of BKFC\u2019s articles of incorporation and bylaws may make it more difficult to acquire control of BKFC by means of a tender offer, open market purchase, proxy fight or otherwise. For example, the articles require the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding voting power of BKFC or, if the Board of Directors recommends against the approval of certain matters, by the holders of at least 75% of the voting power to, among other things, adopt (i) an amendment to the articles or bylaws, (ii) an agreement of merger or consolidation, (iii) a proposed combination or majority share acquisition involving the issuance of shares of BKFC and requiring shareholder approval, and (iv) a proposal to sell, exchange, transfer or otherwise dispose of all, or substantially all, of BKFC\u2019s assets.\nAdditionally, certain provisions of the Kentucky Business Corporation Act that apply to BKFC limit the ability of certain shareholders to engage in business combinations with the company in which they own shares.\nSuch provisions of the articles, bylaws and Kentucky law may have the effect of deterring takeovers or delaying changes in control or management of BKFC.\nHigher FDIC deposit insurance premiums and assessments could adversely impact our earnings.\nFDIC insurance rates increased significantly in 2009, and we may pay higher FDIC premiums in the future. The Dodd-Frank Act established 1.35% as the minimum DRR. The FDIC has determined that the DRR should be 2.0% and has adopted a plan under which it will meet the statutory minimum DRR of 1.35% by the statutory deadline of September 30, 2020. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC to offset the effect on institutions with assets less than $10 billion of the increase in the statutory minimum DRR to 1.35% from the former statutory minimum of 1.15%, although the FDIC has not announced how it will implement this offset.\nIn addition, the FDIC has amended its regulations pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act to base deposit insurance assessments on an insured depository institution\u2019s average consolidated total assets minus its average tangible equity, rather than on its deposit base. It is possible that our insurance premiums will increase under these regulations.\nWe rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure.\nThird parties provide key components of our business infrastructure such as banking services, processing, and Internet connections. Any disruption in such services provided by these third parties or any failure of these third parties to handle current or higher volumes of use could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to clients and otherwise to conduct business. Technological difficulties of a third party service provider could adversely affect our business to the extent those difficulties result in the interruption of services provided by that party. A cyber security breach of a vendor\u2019s system may result in theft of our data or disruption of business processes. A material breach of customer data security at a service provider\u2019s site may negatively impact our business reputation and cause a loss of customers; result in increased expense and may result in litigation. We rely on our outsourced service providers to implement and maintain prudent cyber security controls. Furthermore, we may not be insured against all types of losses as a result of third party failures and our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all losses resulting from system failures or other disruptions.\nRisks Related to the Merger with BB&T\nBecause the market price of BB&T common stock may fluctuate, we cannot be certain of the precise value of the stock portion of the merger consideration that our shareholders may receive in the merger.\nAt the time the merger is completed, each issued and outstanding share of BKFC common stock (other than shares owned by BKFC, BB&T or any of their subsidiaries and shares of BKFC common stock in respect of which dissenter\u2019s rights have been properly exercised and perfected) will be converted into the right to receive consideration in the form of a combination of BB&T common stock and cash.\nThere will be a time lapse between each of the date on which BKFC shareholders voted to approve the merger agreement at the special meeting, and the date on which BKFC shareholders entitled to receive shares of BB&T common stock actually receive such shares. The market value of BB&T common stock may fluctuate during these periods. Consequently, the actual value of the shares of BB&T common stock received by the BKFC shareholders will depend on the market value of shares of BB&T common stock on that date. This market value may be less or more than the value used to determine the exchange ratio, as that determination will be made with respect to a period occurring prior to the consummation of the merger.\nThe market price for BB&T common stock may be affected by factors different from those that historically have affected BKFC.\nUpon completion of the merger, holders of BKYF common stock will become holders of BB&T common stock. BB&T\u2019s businesses differ from those of BKFC, and accordingly the results of operations of BB&T will be affected by some factors that are different from those currently affecting the results of operations of BKFC.\nBKFC\u2019s shareholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest after the merger and will exercise less influence over management.\nCurrently, BKFC\u2019s shareholders have the power to approve or reject any matters requiring shareholder approval under Kentucky law and BKFC\u2019s charter and bylaws. After the merger, absent any adjustment made to the ratio of stock component in the merger consideration, BKFC shareholders are expected to become owners of approximately 1.1% of the outstanding shares of BB&T common stock. Even if all former BKFC shareholders voted together on all matters presented to BB&T\u2019s shareholders, from time to time, the former BKFC shareholders most likely would not have a significant impact on the approval or rejection of future BB&T proposals submitted to a shareholder vote.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of the merger.\nBB&T and BKFC entered into the merger agreement with the expectation that BB&T would be able to successfully integrate BKFC\u2019s operations and that the merger would result in various benefits, including, among other things, enhanced revenues and revenue synergies, an expanded market reach and operating efficiencies. Achieving the anticipated benefits of the merger is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether BB&T is able to integrate and operate BKFC in an efficient and effective manner, and general competitive factors in the market place. The process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of one or more of the surviving bank\u2019s businesses or the loss of key personnel. The diversion of management\u2019s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the merger and the integration of BKFC\u2019s operations could have an adverse effect on the business, financial condition, operating results and prospects of the surviving entity after the merger. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy and could have an adverse effect on the surviving entity\u2019s business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nAmong the factors considered by the boards of directors of BB&T and BKFC in connection with their respective approvals of the merger agreement were the benefits that could result from the merger. We cannot give any assurance that these benefits will be realized within the time periods contemplated or even that they will be realized at all.\nThe merger agreement contains provisions that may discourage other companies from trying to acquire BKFC for greater merger consideration.\nThe merger agreement contains provisions that may discourage a third party from submitting an acquisition proposal to BKFC that might result in greater value to BKFC\u2019s shareholders than the merger. These provisions include a general prohibition on BKFC from soliciting, or, subject to certain exceptions, entering into discussions with any third party regarding any acquisition proposal or offers for competing transactions. Certain shareholders of BKFC have entered into a voting and support agreement and have agreed to vote their shares of BKFC common stock in favor of the proposal to approve the merger and the proposal to adjourn the special meeting if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies, and against any alternative transaction. The shareholders that are party to the voting and support agreement described in this paragraph beneficially own in the aggregate approximately 10.3% of the outstanding shares of BKFC common stock as of the record date. In addition, BKFC may be required to pay BB&T a termination fee in certain circumstances involving acquisition proposals for competing transactions.\nThe merger agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the merger may not be completed.\nThe merger agreement is subject to a number of conditions which must be fulfilled in order to complete the merger. Those conditions include: the receipt of all required regulatory approvals and expiration or termination of the applicable and all statutory waiting periods in respect thereof, the accuracy of representations and warranties under the merger agreement (subject to the materiality standards set forth in the merger agreement), each party\u2019s readiness to consummate the bank merger, BB&T\u2019s and BKFC\u2019s performance of their respective obligations under the merger agreement in all material respects and each of BB&T\u2019s and BKFC\u2019s receipt of a tax opinion to the effect that the merger will be treated as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. These conditions to the closing of the merger may not be fulfilled and, accordingly, the merger may not be completed.\nIn addition, if the merger is not completed by September 5, 2015, either BB&T or BKFC may choose not to proceed with the merger, and the parties can mutually decide to terminate the merger agreement at any time. In addition, BB&T and BKFC may elect to terminate the merger agreement in certain other circumstances. If the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, BKFC may be required to pay a termination fee to BB&T.\nFailure to complete the merger could negatively impact the stock price and the future business and financial results of BKFC.\nIf the merger is not completed for any reason, the ongoing business of BKFC may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the merger, BKFC would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nBKFC may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on its stock price;\n\u2022\nBKFC may experience negative reactions from its customers, vendors and employees;\n\u2022\nBKFC will be required to pay certain costs relating to the merger, whether or not the merger is completed;\n\u2022\nthe merger agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of BKFC\u2019s businesses prior to completion of the merger. Such restrictions, the waiver of which is subject to the consent of BB&T (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), may prevent BKFC from making certain acquisitions or taking certain other specified actions during the pendency of the merger; and\n\u2022\nmatters relating to the merger (including integration planning) will require substantial commitments of time and resources by BKFC management, which would otherwise have been devoted to day-to-day operations and other opportunities that may have been beneficial to BKFC as an independent company.\nIn addition to the above risks, if the merger agreement is terminated and BKFC\u2019s board of directors seeks another merger or business combination, BKFC shareholders cannot be certain that BKFC will be able to find a party willing to offer equivalent or more attractive consideration than the consideration BB&T has agreed to provide in the merger. If the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, BKFC may be required to pay a termination fee to BB&T.\nRegulatory approvals may not be received, may take longer than expected or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or cannot be met.\nBefore the transactions contemplated in the merger agreement may be completed, various approvals must be obtained from the bank regulatory and other governmental authorities. These governmental entities may impose conditions on the granting of such approvals. Such conditions or changes and the process of obtaining regulatory approvals could have the effect of delaying completion of the merger or of imposing additional costs or limitations on the surviving entity following the merger. The regulatory approvals may not be received at any time, may not be received in a timely fashion, and may contain conditions on the completion of the merger that are not anticipated or cannot be met.\nBKFC will be subject to business uncertainties while the merger is pending, which could adversely affect its business.\nUncertainty about the effect of the merger on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on BKFC, and, consequently, the surviving entity. These uncertainties may impair BKFC\u2019s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is consummated and for a period of time thereafter, and could cause customers and others that deal with BKFC to seek to change their existing business relationships with BKFC. Employee retention at BKFC may be particularly challenging during the pendency of the merger, as employees may experience uncertainty about their roles with the surviving entity following the merger.\nShares of BB&T common stock to be received by BKFC shareholders as a result of the merger will have rights different from the shares of BKFC common stock.\nUpon completion of the merger, the rights of former BKFC shareholders will be governed by the articles of incorporation and bylaws of BB&T and by North Carolina corporate law. The rights associated with BB&T common stock and the terms of North Carolina corporate law are different from the rights associated with BKFC common stock and the terms of Kentucky corporate law, which currently govern the rights of BKFC shareholders.", "PERMNO": 92851, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "BKYF"}
