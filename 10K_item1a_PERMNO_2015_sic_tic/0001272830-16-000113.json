{"cik": "1272830", "company": "VONAGE HOLDINGS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-12", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks below, as well as all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in evaluating our company and our business. Any of these risks could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our common stock.\nFor the financial information discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, other than per share and per line amounts, dollar amounts are presented in thousands, except where noted.\nIf we are unable to compete successfully, we could lose market share and revenue.\nThe Unified Communications as a service, or UCaaS industry is highly competitive. We face intense competition from traditional telephone service providers, cable companies and alternative voice and video communication providers, including other providers of UCaaS services.\nTo the extent that UCaaS providers such as EvolveIP, Jive, Mitel, RingCentral, ShoretelSky, Thinking Phone, West IP Communications, 8x8, and other companies strengthen their offerings to small and medium businesses, we may have to reduce our prices, increase promotions, or offer additional features, which may adversely impact our revenues and profitability.\nMost traditional wireline and wireless telephone service providers, including AT&T, Verizon Communications, CenturyLink, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon Wireless, and cable companies, such as Cablevision, Charter Communications, Comcast Corporation, Cox Communications, and Time Warner Cable, are substantially larger and better capitalized than we are and have the advantage of greater name and brand name recognition and a large existing customer base. Because most of our target consumer services customers are already purchasing communications services from one or more of these providers, our success is dependent upon our ability to attract target customers away from their existing providers. Our competitors' financial resources may allow them to offer services at prices below cost or even for free in order to maintain and gain market share or otherwise improve their competitive positions. Our competitors also could use their greater financial resources to develop and market telephony and messaging services with more attractive features and more robust customer service. In addition, because of the other services our competitors provide, they often choose to offer VoIP services as part of a bundle that includes other products, such as video, high speed Internet access, and wireless telephone service. These bundled offers may enable our competitors to offer VoIP service at prices with which we may not be able to compete or to offer functionality that integrates VoIP service with their other offerings, both of which may be more desirable. Any of these competitive factors could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain customers, reduce our market share and revenues, or cause us to lower our prices or offer additional features that may result in additional costs without commensurate price increases.\nWe also compete against alternative communication providers, some of which are larger than us, have greater name and brand recognition, and have the ability to devote greater resources to their communications services. Some of these service providers, including Internet product and software companies, have chosen to sacrifice telephony revenue in order to gain market share or attract customers to their platform or have lower cost structures and have offered their services at low prices or for free or are using different payment structures such as one-time or low annual fees. As we continue the introduction of applications that integrate different forms of voice and messaging services over multiple devices, we face competition from emerging competitors focused on similar integration, as well as from established alternative communication providers. In order to compete with such service providers, we may have to reduce our prices, which\nwould impair our profitability, or offer additional features that may cause us to incur additional costs without commensurate price increases.\nIn connection with our emphasis on the international long distance market for consumer customers, we face competition from low-cost international calling cards, digital calling cards and VoIP providers in addition to traditional telephone companies, cable companies, and wireless companies. To the extent that these providers target marketing to the same ethnic segments that we target or strengthen their offerings to these segments, we may have to reduce our prices or increase promotions, which would impair our profitability, or offer additional features that may cause us to incur additional costs without commensurate price increase.\nAs a result of increasing competition, domestic and international telephony and messaging rates have generally decreased during the past few years, and we expect this trend to continue. Continued rate pressures or increasing cost to use our services could lessen or eliminate the pricing advantage that we maintain over certain competitors and cause customers or potential customers to select alternative providers or cause us to lower our prices, which would adversely impact our revenues and profitability.\nAs the UCaaS market evolves, and the convergence of voice, video, messaging, mobility and data networking technologies accelerates, we may face competition in the future from companies that do not currently compete in the UCaaS market, including companies that currently compete in other sectors, companies that serve consumer rather than business customers, or companies which expand their market presence to include business communications.\nIn connection with our UCaaS markets, we face competition from the traditional telephone and cable companies, as well as from vendors of premises-based solutions and/or hosted solutions. As the UCaaS market evolves, combining voice, video, messaging and data networks, and information technology and communication applications, opportunity is created for new competitors to enter the UCaaS market and offer competing products. This new competition may take many forms, and may offer products and applications similar to ours. If these new competitors emerge, the UCaaS market will become increasingly competitive and we may not be able to maintain or improve our market position. Our failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIf we fail to adapt to rapid changes in the market for UCaaS services, then our products and services could become obsolete.\nThe market for our products and services is constantly and rapidly evolving as we and our competitors introduce new and enhanced products and services and react to changes in the UCaaS industry and customer demands. We may not be able to develop or acquire new products and plans or product and plan enhancements that compete effectively with present or emerging UCaaS technologies or differentiate our products and plans based on functionality and performance. In addition, we may not be able to establish or maintain strategic alliances that will permit enhancement opportunities or innovative distribution methods for our products and plans.\nTo address these issues, we are targeting revenue growth in large, existing markets, which require us to enhance our current products and plans, and develop new products and plans on a timely basis to keep pace with market needs and satisfy the increasingly sophisticated requirements of customers. For example, in 2015 we acquired iCore Networks, Inc. to further increase our penetration of the UCaaS market. If we are unable to attract users of these services our net revenues may fail to grow as we expect.\nUCaaS is complex, and new products and plans and enhancements to existing products and plans can require long development and testing periods. Any delays in developing and releasing new or enhanced products and plans could cause us to lose\n9 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2015\nrevenue opportunities and customers. Any technical flaws in products we release could diminish the innovative impact of the products and have a negative effect on customer adoption and our reputation.\nWe also are subject to the risk of future disruptive technologies. New products based on new technologies or new industry standards could render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable. If new technologies develop that are able to deliver competing voice and messaging services at lower prices, better or more conveniently, it could have a material adverse effect on us.\nIf we are unsuccessful at retaining customers or attracting new consumer or business customers we may experience a reduction in revenue or may be required to spend more money or alter our marketing approaches to grow our customer base.\nOur rate of customer terminations for our UCaaS services could increase in the future if customers are not satisfied with the quality and reliability of our network, the value proposition of our products, and the ability of our customer service to meet the needs and expectations of our customers. We measure customer terminations for our consumer customers by average monthly customer churn and for our Essentials and Premier business customers by average monthly revenue churn. Competition from traditional telephone companies, cable companies, wireless companies, alternative communications providers, low-cost international calling cards, disruptive technologies, general economic conditions, and our ability to activate and register new customers on our networks, also influence our churn rate.\nAs we continue to emphasize the international long distance market for our consumer customers, we expect our churn to be impacted by the ethnic segments that we target. For example, we have found that certain ethnic segments have higher churn due to their inability to use our existing payment methods. We may not be able to educate these customers in these payment methods or offer alternative payment methods that serve the needs of these customers. In addition, higher proportions of certain ethnic segments that we target may be more likely to have poor or no credit history, indicating that they may have more difficulty affording the service, leading to higher churn for these customers.\nBecause of customer losses, we have to acquire new customers on an ongoing basis just to maintain our existing level of customers and revenues. As a result, marketing and sales expense, and the effectiveness of our marketing and selling expenses, is an ongoing requirement to maintain or grow our business. If our churn rate increases, we will have to acquire even more new customers in order to maintain our existing revenues. We incur significant costs to acquire new customers, and those costs are an important factor in maintaining profitability. Therefore, if we are unsuccessful in retaining customers, are required to spend significant amounts to acquire new customers beyond those budgeted, or our marketing and selling efforts are not effective in targeting specific customer segments, we may be forced to change marketing and sales approaches or vendors, our revenue could decrease or we could incur losses.\nOur success in the UCaaS market depends in part on developing and maintaining effective distribution channels, including our internal direct sales team. The failure to develop and maintain a successful internal direct sales team could materially and adversely affect our business.\nA portion of our business revenue is generated through our direct sales, or \u201cfield sales\u201d team. This channel consists of sales agents that market and sell our products and services to customers. This channel may generate an increasing portion of our business revenue in the future. Our continued success requires that we continue developing and maintaining a successful sales organization. If we fail to do so, or if our sales agents are not successful in their sales efforts, our sales may decrease and our operating results would suffer.\nOur success in the UCaaS market depends in part on developing and maintaining effective distribution channels, including with third-party resellers and value-added distributors. The failure to develop and maintain these relationships could materially and adversely affect our business.\nA portion of our business revenue is generated through indirect channel sales. These channels consist of third-party resellers and value-added distributors that market and sell UCaaS products and services to customers. These channels may generate an increasing portion of our business revenue in the future. Generally, we do not have long-term contracts with these third-party resellers and value-added distributors, and the loss of or reduction in sales through these third parties could materially reduce our revenues. We also compete for preference amongst our current or potential resellers with our competitors. Our continued success requires that we continue developing and maintaining successful relationships with these third-party resellers and value-added distributors. If we fail to do so, or if our resellers are not successful in their sales efforts, our sales may decrease and our operating results would suffer.\nWe may face difficulties related to the acquisition or integration of businesses, which could harm our growth or operating results.\nBeginning with our acquisition of Vocalocity in 2013, we have made five acquisitions related to the UCaaS market, including Simple Signal, Inc. and iCore Networks, Inc. in 2015. We may elect to acquire additional businesses or assets in the future. These activities require substantial management time and resources. We cannot predict or guarantee that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate any acquisition. In addition, acquisitions of existing businesses, including Simple Signal and iCore, involve substantial risks, including the risk that we may not be able to integrate the operations, personnel, services, or technologies, the potential disruption of our ongoing businesses, the diversion of management attention, the maximization of financial and strategic opportunities, the difficulty in developing or maintaining controls and procedures, and the dilution to our existing stockholders from the issuance of additional shares of common stock. As a result of these and other risks, we may not produce anticipated revenue, profitability, or synergies.\nAcquisitions may require us to issue equity securities, use our cash resources, incur debt or contingent liabilities, amortize intangibles, or write-off acquisition-related expenses. If we are unable to successfully integrate any acquired businesses or assets we may not receive the intended benefits of such acquisition. In addition, we cannot predict market reactions to any acquisitions we may make or to any failure to announce any future acquisitions.\nFurther, while we conduct due diligence in connection with acquisition and joint venture opportunities, there may be risks or liabilities that such due diligence efforts fail to discover, are not disclosed to us, or that we inadequately assess. The discovery of material liabilities associated with acquisitions or joint venture opportunities, economic risks faced by joint venture partners, or any failure of joint venture partners to perform their obligations could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nSecurity breaches and other cybersecurity or technological risks could compromise our information, systems and network and expose us to liability, including a failure to meet Payment Card Industry data security standards, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer and which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nThere are several inherent risks to engaging in a technology business, including our reliance on our data centers and networks, and the use and interconnectivity of those networks. A significant portion of our operations relies heavily on our ability to provide secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in our data centers and on our networks. The secure processing, storage, and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. As seen in our industry and others, these activities have been, and will continue to be, subject to continually evolving cybersecurity or other technological risks. Targeted attacks, such as advanced persistent threat (APT) is prevalent throughout the Internet and associated with the theft of intellectual property and state-sponsored espionage. Due to the nature of our business and reliance on the Internet, we are susceptible to this type of attack. In addition,\n10 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2015\nphysical security of devices located within our offices, and/or remote devices, pose cybersecurity and other technological risks that could negatively impact our business and reputation.\nWe also operate Internet based, worldwide voice, video communications, and messaging services and electronic billing, which require the transmission of confidential information over public networks that may or may not support end to end security. Despite our security measures, which include the development, operation and maintenance of systems and processes that are designed to protect consumer information and prevent fraudulent credit card transactions and other security breaches, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to error, malfeasance or other disruptions by a current or former employee or third-party provider and our failure to mitigate such fraud or breaches may adversely affect our operating results. Any such breach could compromise our systems and network and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, regulatory penalties, disruption to our operations, damage to our reputation, and a loss of confidence in our products and services, and our ability to keep personally identifiable information confidential, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe have been subject to cyber incidents from external sources including \u201cbrute force\u201d and distributed denial of service attacks, as well as attacks that introduce fraudulent VoiP traffic. Although these incidents have not had a material adverse effect financially or on our ability to provide services, this may not continue to be the case going forward. There can be no assurance that cyber incidents will not occur in the future, potentially more frequently and/or on a more significant scale.\nWe have taken steps designed to improve the security of our networks and computer systems and our physical space. Despite these defensive measures, there can be no assurance that we are adequately protecting our information or that we will not experience future incidents. The expenses associated with protecting our information could reduce our operating margins. We maintain insurance intended to cover some of these risks, however, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses from any future breaches of our systems. In addition, third parties with which we do business may also be sources of cybersecurity or other technological risks. We outsource certain functions, which results in the storage and processing of customer information by third parties. While we engage in certain actions to reduce the exposure resulting from outsourcing, unauthorized access, loss or destruction of data or other cyber incidents could occur, resulting in similar costs and consequences as those discussed above.\nWe make available on our website our privacy policy, which describes how we collect, use, and disclose our customers' personal information. To the extent we expand our operations into new geographies, we may become subject to local data security, privacy, data retention, and disclosure laws and regulations. It may be difficult for us to comply with these laws and regulations if they were deemed to be applicable to us. In addition, risks related to cybercrime and fraud increase when establishing a global presence.\nWe are subject to Payment Card Industry (\u201cPCI\u201d) data security standards, which require periodic audits by independent third parties to assess compliance. PCI data security standards are a comprehensive set of requirements for enhancing payment account data security that was developed by the PCI Security Standards Council including American Express, Discover Financial Services, JCB International, MasterCard Worldwide, and VISA Inc., to help facilitate the broad adoption of consistent data security measures. Failure to comply with the security requirements as identified in subsequent audits or rectify a security issue may result in fines. While we believe it is unusual, restrictions on accepting payment cards, including a complete restriction, may be imposed on companies that are not compliant. Further, the law relating to the liability of providers of online payment services is currently unsettled and states may enact their own rules with which we may not comply.\nWe rely on third party providers to process and guarantee payments made by Vonage and its affiliates\u2019 subscribers, up to certain limits, and we may be unable to prevent our customers from fraudulently receiving goods and services. Our liability risk will increase if a larger fraction of our Vonage transactions involve fraudulent or disputed credit card transactions. Any costs we incur as a result of fraudulent or disputed transactions could harm our business. In addition, the functionality of our current billing system relies on certain third party vendors delivering services. If these vendors are unable or unwilling to provide services, we will not be able to charge for our services in a timely or scalable fashion, which could significantly decrease our revenue and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nSales of our UCaaS services to medium-sized and enterprise customers involve significant risks which, if not managed effectively, could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nAs we continue to expand our sales efforts to medium-sized and larger businesses, we may incur higher selling expense and longer, more complex, sales cycles. Customers in this market segment may also require bespoke features and integration services, increasing the complexity and expense related to the sales and delivery process. As a result, we may devote greater sales and support to these customers, which may result in increased costs and a strain on our support resources. These factors could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and our overall ability to grow our customer base.\nOur ability to provide our telephony service and manage related customer accounts is dependent upon third-party facilities, equipment, and systems, the failure of which could cause delays of or interruptions to our service, damage our reputation, cause us to lose customers, limit our growth, and affect our financial condition.\nOur success depends on our ability to provide quality and reliable telephony service, which is in part dependent upon the proper functioning of facilities and equipment owned and operated by third parties and is, therefore, beyond our control. Unlike traditional wireline telephone service or wireless service, our telephony service typically requires our customers to have an operative broadband Internet connection and an electrical power supply, which are provided by the customer's Internet service provider and electric utility company, respectively, and not by us. The quality of some broadband Internet connections may be too poor for customers to use our telephony services properly. In addition, if there is any interruption to a customer's broadband Internet service or electrical power supply, that customer will be unable to make or receive calls, including emergency calls, using our telephony service.\nWe outsource several of our network functions to third-party providers. For example, we outsource the maintenance of our regional data connection points, which are the facilities at which our network interconnects with the public switched telephone network. If our third-party service providers fail to maintain these facilities properly, or fail to respond quickly to problems, our customers may experience service interruptions. Interruptions in our service caused by third-party facilities have in the past caused and may in the future cause us to lose customers or cause us to offer substantial customer credits, which could adversely affect our revenue and profitability. If interruptions adversely affect the perceived reliability of our service, we may have difficulty attracting new customers, and our brand, reputation, and growth will be negatively impacted.\nIn order to access our consumer services, a customer needs to connect a standard telephone to a broadband Internet connection through a Vonage-enabled device that we provide. Although we closely monitor inventory levels, if we are unable to procure a sufficient number of devices from our suppliers in a timely manner, including as a result of a failure by a component supplier, we would be delayed in activating new customers and may lose these customers.\nWhile we believe that relations with our current third party providers are good, and we have contracts in place with these vendors, there can be no guarantee that these third party providers will be able\n11 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2015\nor willing to supply services to us in the future on commercially reasonable terms, or that we will be able to engage alternative or additional providers. We believe that we could replace our current third party providers, however, our ability to provide our UCaaS services may be impacted during any transition, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe rely on third-party hardware and software that may be difficult to replace or may not perform adequately.\nIn some cases we rely on purchased or leased hardware and software licensed from third parties in order to provide our UCaaS services. For example, Broadsoft, Inc. provides us with infrastructure, call termination and origination services, and other hardware and software in connection with our Premier offerings. We also integrate third-party licensed software components into our platform. This hardware and software may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or pricing or may fail to continue to be updated to remain competitive. The loss of the right to use this third party hardware or software may increase our expenses or impact the provisioning of our services. The failure of this third party hardware or software could materially impact the performance of our UCaaS services and may cause material harm to our business or results of operations.\nFlaws in our technology and systems or our failure to adapt our systems to any new Internet Protocol could cause delays or interruptions of service, which could damage our reputation, cause us to lose customers, and limit our growth.\nAlthough we have designed our service network to reduce the possibility of disruptions or other outages, our service may be disrupted by problems with our technology and systems, such as malfunctions in our Vonage-enabled device that we provide to customers, software or facilities and overloading of our network. As we attract new subscribers, we expect increased call volume that we need to manage to avoid network interruptions. In particular, as we have marketed to different international long distance markets, we have seen international call volumes to targeted countries increase. During the next few years we expect wide-spread industry adoption of a new Internet Protocol, which is a set of standard communications and routing mechanisms. Customers may experience periodic delays of service caused by the industry transition to this new Internet Protocol. Interruptions have caused and may in the future cause us to lose customers and offer substantial customer credits, which could adversely affect our revenue and profitability. Network interruptions have also impaired our ability at times to sign-up new customers and the ability of customers to manage their accounts. If service interruptions or other outages adversely affect the perceived reliability of our telephony service or customer service, we may have difficulty attracting and retaining customers and our brand reputation and growth may suffer.\nIn addition, we utilize third-party Internet-based or \u201ccloud\u201d computing services in connection with some of our business operations. Any disruption to the internet or to our third-party Web hosting or cloud computing providers, including technological or business-related disruptions, could adversely impact the experience of our customers and have adverse effects on our operations. In addition, fires, floods, earthquakes, power losses, telecommunications failures, and similar \"Acts of God\" could damage these systems and hardware or cause them to fail completely. While we do maintain redundant systems consistent with industry best practices, including standby data centers, certain events could result in downtime for our operations and could adversely affect our business.\nOur UCaaS business is growing rapidly, and any inability to scale our business and grow efficiently could materially and adversely harm our business and results of operations.\nAs our UCaaS business expands, we will need to continue to improve our application architecture, integrate our products and applications across our technology platforms, integrate with third-party systems, and maintain infrastructure performance. We expect the number of users, the amount of data transferred and processed, the number of locations where our service is being used, and the volume of communications over our networks to continue to expand. To address\nthis growth, we will need to scale our systems and customer services organization. Our ability to execute on these initiatives may impact system and network performance, customer satisfaction, and ultimately, sales and revenue. These efforts may also divert management resources. These factors may materially and adversely harm our business and results of operations.\nWe depend on third party vendors to supply, configure and deliver the phones that we sell. Any delays in delivery, or failure to operate effectively with our own servers and systems, may result in delay or failure of our services, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on Yealink Inc. and Polycom, Inc. to provide, and a single fulfillment agent to configure and deliver, the phones that we offer for sale to our customers that use our UCaaS services. If these third parties are unable to deliver phones of acceptable quality or quantity, or in a timely manner, we may be forced to offer replacements at a higher cost than what is currently contracted. In addition, these phones must interoperate with our servers and systems. If either of our providers changes the operation of their phones, we may be required to engage in development efforts to ensure that the new phones interoperate with our system. The failure of our vendor-supplied phones to operate effectively with our system could impact our customers\u2019 ability to use our services and could cause customers to cancel our services, which may cause material harm to our business or results of operations.\nWe market our products and services to small and medium-sized businesses, which may be disproportionately impacted by fluctuations in economic conditions.\nWe market our products to small and medium-sized businesses. Customers in this market may be affected by economic downturns to a greater extent, and may have more limited financial resources, than larger or more established businesses. If customers in our UCaaS markets experience financial hardship as a result of a weak economy, the demand for our services could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe storage, processing, and use of personal information and related data subjects us to evolving governmental laws and regulation, commercial standards, contractual obligations, and other legal obligations related to consumer and data privacy, which may have a material impact on our costs, use of our products and services, or expose us to increased liability.\nFederal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, commercial obligations and industry standards, each provide for obligations and restrictions with respect to data privacy and security, as well as the collection, storage, retention, protection, use, processing, transmission, sharing, disclosure and protection of personal information and other customer data. The evolving nature of these obligations and restrictions dictates that differing interpretations, inconsistency or conflicts among countries or rules, and general uncertainty impact the application to our business.\nThese obligations and restrictions may limit our ability to collect, store, process, use, transmit and share data with our customers, employees, and third party providers and to allow our customers to collect, store, retain, protect, use, process, transmit, share and disclose data with others through our products and services. Compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such obligations and restrictions could increase the cost of our operations and impact our ability to market our products and services through effective segmentation.\nFailure to comply with obligations and restrictions related to applicable data protection laws, regulations, standards, and codes of conduct, as well as our own posted privacy policies and contractual commitments could subject us to lawsuits, fines, criminal penalties, statutory damages, consent decrees, injunctions, adverse publicity, loss of user confidence in our services, and loss of users, which could materially harm our business. Additionally, third-party contractors may have access to customer or employee data. If these or other third-party vendors violate obligations and restrictions related to applicable data protection laws or our policies, such violations may also put our\n12 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2015\ncustomers\u2019 or employees\u2019 information at risk and could in turn have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nIf we fail to protect our internally developed systems, technology, and software and our trademarks, we may become involved in costly litigation or our business or brand may be harmed.\nOur ability to compete effectively is dependent in large part upon the maintenance and protection of systems and software that we have developed internally based on open standards. While we own more than 100 issued U.S. patents (and a number of foreign patents) and more than 220 pending U.S. patent applications (and a number of foreign patent applications), we cannot patent much of the technology that is important to our business. Our pending patent applications may not be granted. Any issued patent that we own may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated, or circumvented. To date, we have relied on patent, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements, to establish and protect our rights to this technology. We typically enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, customers, and vendors in an effort to control access to and distribution of technology, software, documentation, and other information. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use this technology without authorization. Policing unauthorized use of this technology is difficult. The steps we take may not prevent misappropriation of the technology we rely on. In addition, effective protection may be unavailable or limited in some jurisdictions outside the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or protect our rights or to determine the validity and scope of the rights of others. That litigation could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert resources away from our daily business, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business.\nThe unlicensed use of our brands by third parties could harm our reputation, cause confusion among our customers, and impair our ability to market our services. To that end, we have registered numerous trademarks and service marks and have applied for registration of our trademarks and service marks in the United States and abroad to establish and protect our brand names as part of our intellectual property strategy. If our applications receive objections or are successfully opposed by third parties, it may be difficult for us to prevent third parties from using our brand without our permission. Moreover, successful opposition to our applications might encourage third parties to make additional oppositions or commence trademark infringement proceedings against us, which could be costly and time consuming to defend against. If we decide to take limited or no action to protect our trademarks, our trademark rights may be diluted and subject to challenge or invalidation, which could materially and adversely affect our brand in the marketplace.\nThird parties may fraudulently use our name to obtain access to customer accounts and other personal information, use our services to commit fraud or steal our services, which could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and cause us to incur additional expenses.\nOur customers have been subject to \u201cphishing,\u201d which occurs when a third party calls or sends an email or pop-up message to a customer that claims to be from a business or organization that provides services to the customer. The purpose of the inquiry is typically to encourage the customer to visit a bogus website designed to look like a website operated by the legitimate business or organization or provide information to the operator. At the bogus website, the operator attempts to trick the customer into divulging customer account or other personal information such as credit card information or to introduce viruses through \u201cTrojan horse\u201d programs to the customers\u2019 computers. This has resulted in identity theft from our customers and the unauthorized use of Vonage services. Third parties have also used our communications services to commit fraud. Although we have engaged a third party to assist in the shutdown of purported phishing sites, if we are unable to detect and prevent \u201cphishing,\u201d use of our services for fraud, and similar activities, our brand reputation and growth may suffer and we may incur additional costs, including costs to increase security, or be required to credit significant amounts to customers.\nThird parties also have used our communications services without paying, including by submitting fraudulent credit card information. This has resulted in our incurring the cost of providing the services, including incurring call termination fees, without any corresponding revenues. We have implemented anti-fraud procedures in order to limit the expenses resulting from theft of service. If our procedures are not effective, theft of service could significantly increase our expenses and negatively impact our profitability.\nCertain rights to third party patents and technology may not be available, which may decrease the quality of our products or services or subject us to liability.\nWe may seek to obtain rights to third party technology in the future, but may not be able to agree upon commercially reasonable terms or at all with respect to obtaining such rights. If we are unable to extend existing licenses or are unable to obtain rights to other technology that may be commercially advantageous or necessary for our product and service offerings, we may experience a decrease in the quality of our products or services or we may lose the ability to provide our products and services on a non-infringing basis until alternative technology or suitable alternative products and services can be developed, identified, obtained (through acquisition, license or other grants of rights), and integrated.\nWe may be subject to damaging and disruptive intellectual property litigation that could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition, as well as the continued viability of our company.\nThere has been substantial litigation in the UCaaS, VoIP, telecommunications, hosted services, and related industries regarding intellectual property rights and, given the rapid technological change in our industry and our continual development of new products and services, we and/or our commercial partners may be subject to infringement claims from time to time. For example, we may be unaware of filed patent applications and issued patents that could include claims that might be interpreted to cover our products and services. We have been subject to patent infringement claims in the past, are currently named as a defendant in several proceedings that relate to alleged patent infringement, and from time to time we receive letters from third parties offering an opportunity for us to obtain licenses to patents that may be relevant to our business or alleging that our services infringe upon third party patents or other intellectual property. See \u201cItem 3. - Legal Proceedings-IP Matters.\u201d\nParties making claims of infringement may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to provide our services and could cause us to pay substantial royalties, licensing fees, damages or settlement fees. The defense of any lawsuit could divert management\u2019s efforts and attention from ordinary business operations and result in time-consuming and expensive litigation, regardless of the merits of such claims. These outcomes may:\n>\nresult in the loss of a substantial number of existing customers or prohibit the acquisition of new customers;\n>\ncause us to accelerate expenditures to preserve existing revenues;\n>\ncause existing or new vendors to require prepayments or letters of credit;\n>\ncause our credit card processors to demand reserves or letters of credit or make holdbacks;\n>\nresult in substantial employee layoffs;\n>\nmaterially and adversely affect our brand in the marketplace and cause a substantial loss of goodwill;\n>\ncause our stock price to decline significantly;\n>\nmaterially and adversely affect our liquidity, including our ability to pay debts and other obligations as they become due;\n13 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2015\n>\ncause us to change our business methods or services;\n>\nrequire us to cease certain business operations or offering certain products and services; and\n>\nlead to our bankruptcy or liquidation.\nWe rely on third parties to provide a portion of our customer service representatives, provide aspects of our E-911 service, which differs from traditional 911 service, and initiate local number portability for our customers. If these third parties do not provide our customers with reliable, high-quality service, our reputation will be harmed and we may lose customers.\nWe offer our customers support 24 hours a day, seven days a week through both our comprehensive online account management website and our toll free number. Our customer support is currently provided via United States based employees as well as third party partners located in the United States, Philippines, Costa Rica, Chile, Mexico, and India. We offer support in English, Spanish, and French Canadian. Our third-party providers generally represent us without identifying themselves as independent parties. The ability to support our customers may be disrupted by natural disasters, inclement weather conditions, civil unrest, and other adverse events in the locations where our customer support is provided.\nWe also contract for services required to provide E-911 services including assistance in routing emergency calls, terminating E-911 calls, operating a national call center that is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week to receive certain emergency calls, and maintaining PSAP databases for the purpose of deploying and operating E-911 services. Interruptions in service from our vendor could cause failures in our customers\u2019 access to E-911 services and expose us to liability and damage our reputation.\nWe also have agreements with companies that initiate our local number portability, which allow new customers to retain their existing telephone numbers when subscribing to our services.\nIf any of these third parties do not provide reliable, high-quality service, our reputation and our business will be harmed. In addition, industry consolidation among providers of services to us may impact our ability to obtain these services or increase our expense for these services.\nOur services are subject to regulation in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada, and future legislative, regulatory or judicial actions could adversely affect our business and expose us to liability.\nOur business has developed in a relatively lightly regulated environment. However, the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada have applied some traditional telephone company regulations to VoIP and continue to evaluate how VoIP should be regulated. The effects of future regulatory developments are uncertain. At the federal level in the U.S., the Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d) has imposed certain telecommunications regulations on VoIP services including:\n>\nRequirements to provide E911 service;\n>\nCommunications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (\u201cCALEA\u201d) obligations;\n>\nObligation to support Universal Service;\n>\nCustomer Proprietary Network Information (\u201cCPNI\u201d) requirements;\n>\nDisability access obligations;\n>\nLocal Number Portability requirements;\n>\nService discontinuance notification obligations;\n>\nOutage reporting requirements; and\n>\nRural call completion reporting and rules related to ring signal integrity.\nIn general, the focus of interconnected VoIP telecommunications regulation is at the federal level. On November 12, 2004, the FCC issued a declaratory ruling providing that our service is subject to federal regulation and preempted the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission from imposing certain of its regulations on us. While this ruling does not exempt us from all state oversight of our service, it effectively prevents state telecommunications regulators from imposing certain burdensome and inconsistent market entry requirements and certain other state utility rules and regulations on our service. As such, Vonage is subject to relatively few state regulatory requirements including:\n>\nPayment of state and local E911 fees; and\n>\nState Universal Service support obligations.\nIn Canada, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (\u201cCRTC\u201d) regulates VoIP service. CRTC VoIP regulations include:\n>\nRequirement to provide 911 service; and\n>\nLocal Number Portability requirements.\nIn the UK, we are subject to regulation in the UK by the Office of Communications (\u201cOFCOM\u201d). OFCOM VoIP regulations include:\n>\nRequirement to provide 999/112 service; and\n>\nNumber Portability requirements.\nVonage seeks to comply with all applicable regulatory requirements. We could, however, be subject to regulatory enforcement action if a regulator does not believe that we are complying with applicable regulations.\nIn addition, the regulatory framework for VoIP service is still evolving and it is possible that Vonage could be subject to additional regulatory obligations and/or existing regulatory obligations could be modified or expanded. The effects of future regulatory developments are uncertain. Future legislative, judicial or other regulatory actions could have a negative effect on our business. If we become subject to the rules and regulations applicable to telecommunications providers in individual states, we may incur significant litigation and compliance costs, and we may have to restructure our service offerings, exit certain markets, or raise the price of our services, any of which could cause our services to be less attractive to customers. In addition, future regulatory developments could increase our cost of doing business and limit our growth.\nWe may incur significant costs and harm to our reputation from lawsuits and regulatory inquiries related to our business practices, which may also divert the attention of our management from other aspects of our business.\nWe have been subject to periodic regulatory inquiries regarding our business practices, including an investigation settled in 2009 with a group of 32 states' attorneys general into certain of our business practices. There was no finding of any violation or wrongdoing by us, and the 32 states participating in the settlement released us and our affiliates from the matters investigated. On July 18, 2011, we entered into an amended settlement agreement initiated at our request to reflect revised business practices associated with our new \u201cconsumable\u201d product offerings. Any similar claims or regulatory inquiries, whether successful or not, could require us to devote significant amounts of monetary or human resources to defend ourselves and could harm our reputation. We may need to spend significant amounts on our legal defense, senior management may be required to divert their attention from other portions of our business, new product launches may be deferred or canceled as a result of any proceedings, and we may be required to make changes to our present and planned products or services. If, as a result of any proceedings, a judgment is rendered or a decree is entered against us, it may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and harm our reputation.\n14 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2015\nIf we are unable to establish and expand effective strategic relationships our ability to grow revenues and offer new products under commercially attractive terms may be inhibited, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nAn element of our strategy is to develop and maintain strategic relationships. We have or are pursuing relationships in the U.S. retail industry as well as with entities in the business markets. The continued development of these relationships may assist us in enhancing our brand, introducing our products and services to larger numbers and types of customers, developing and implementing new products and services, and generating additional revenue. We may not be able to enter into new relationships on economic terms favorable to us. In addition, if we lose any of our important strategic relationships or if strategic relationships fail to benefit us as expected, our ability to grow revenues and offer new products may be inhibited, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, inefficiencies or fraud on the part of mass merchant retailers or vendors associated with our assisted selling programs could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur international long distance business is subject to country-specific governmental regulation and related actions and taxes that may increase our costs or impact our product offerings.\nIn the United States, Canada, and United Kingdom, we are not a regulated telecommunications business. Our services are also in use in countries outside of the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, including countries where providing VoIP services is or may be illegal. We may need to change our service offerings to avoid regulation as a telecommunications business in a jurisdiction, or if we are treated as a regulated telecommunications business, we may be required to incur additional expenses. In addition, if governments believe that we are providing unauthorized service in their countries, they may pursue fines, penalties, or other governmental action, including criminal action, that may damage our brand and reputation. If we use a local partner to provide services in a country and the local partner does not comply with applicable governmental regulations, we may face additional regulation, liabilities, penalties or other governmental action, and our brand and reputation may be harmed.\nIn addition to the risk of being directly subjected to regulation, decisions by foreign regulators to increase the charge for terminating international calls into their countries may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain international long distance customers in the U.S., U.K., and Canada. For example, our Vonage World offering includes calling to over 60 countries. Regulatory actions in any of these countries, which has occurred in the past, could cause increased costs, impact margin, cause us to remove a country from Vonage World, and impact churn and gross line additions. These regulatory actions may be taken without notice and cause us to react quickly to changing market conditions. These efforts could divert management\u2019s efforts and attention from ordinary business operations which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nAs a United States-based company, any foreign subsidiary or joint venture that we use for international operations may be subject to a variety of governmental regulations in the countries where we market our products, including tariffs and taxes. For example, distributions of earnings and other payments, including interest, received from our foreign subsidiaries may be subject to withholding taxes imposed by the jurisdiction in which such entities are formed or operating, which will reduce the amount of after-tax cash we can receive. In general, as a United States corporation, we may claim a foreign tax credit against our federal income tax expense for such foreign withholding taxes and for foreign income taxes paid directly by foreign corporate entities in which we own 10% or more of the voting stock. The ability to claim such foreign tax credits and to utilize net foreign losses is, however, subject to numerous limitations, and we may incur incremental tax costs as a result of these limitations or because we are not currently in a tax-paying position in the United States. We may also be required to include in our income for United States federal income tax purposes our proportionate share of certain earnings of those foreign subsidiaries that are classified as \u201ccontrolled foreign corporations\u201d\nwithout regard to whether distributions have been actually received from such subsidiaries.\nWe are dependent on a small number of individuals, and if we lose key personnel upon whom we are dependent, our business will be adversely affected.\nMany of the key responsibilities of our business have been assigned to a relatively small number of individuals. Our future success depends to a considerable degree on the vision, skills, experience, and effort of our senior management. The loss of the services of these officers could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, our continued growth depends on our ability to attract and retain experienced key employees.\nWe are subject to risks that are inherent in operating abroad, including country-specific risks.\nSome of our research and development personnel and facilities are located in Israel. Political, economic and military conditions in Israel directly affect our operations. For example, increased violence or armed conflict in the Middle East may disrupt travel and communications in the region, harming our operations there. Furthermore, some of our employees in Israel are obligated to perform up to 36 days of military reserve duty annually and may be called to active duty in a time of crisis. The absence of these employees for significant periods may cause us to operate inefficiently during these periods.\nWe may be exposed to liabilities under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act, and similar laws, and any determination that we violated any of these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practice Act (\"FCPA\"), the UK Bribery Act and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by persons and entities for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have operations, agreements with third parties, and make sales internationally. In addition, we plan to expand our international operations through potential joint ventures with local partners. Our international activities create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees, consultants, partners, sales agents or distributors, even though these parties are not always subject to our control. It is our policy to prohibit these practices by our employees, consultants, partners, sales agents or distributors, however, our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective, and our employees, consultants, partners, sales agents or distributors may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. Violations of the FCPA, the UK Bribery Act or other laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nThe success of our business relies on customers\u2019 continued and unimpeded access to broadband service. Providers of broadband services may be able to block our services or charge their customers more for also using our services, which could adversely affect our revenue and growth.\nOur customers must have broadband access to the Internet in order to use our service. Some providers of broadband access, including outside of the United States, may take measures that affect their customers\u2019 ability to use our service, such as degrading the quality of the data packets we transmit over their lines, giving those packets low priority, giving other packets higher priority than ours, blocking our packets entirely or attempting to charge their customers more for also using our services.\nIn the United States, there continues to be some uncertainty regarding whether suppliers of broadband Internet access have a legal obligation to allow their customers to access and use our service without interference. On February 26, 2015, the FCC adopted neutrality rules that would protect against interference by suppliers of broadband Internet access. Several parties filed appeals which are pending at the\n15 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2015\nD.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. Oral arguments at the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals were held on December 4, 2015.\nIf customers do not accept the differences between our service and traditional telephone service, they may choose to remain with their current telephone service provider or may choose to return to service provided by traditional telephone companies.\nFor certain users, aspects of our service are not the same as traditional telephone service. Our continued growth is dependent on the adoption of our services by mainstream customers, so these differences are important. For example:\n>\nBoth our E-911 and emergency calling services are different, in significant respects, from the 911 service associated with traditional wireline and wireless telephone providers and, in certain cases, with other VoIP providers.\n>\nIn the event of a power loss or Internet access interruption experienced by a customer, our service is interrupted. Unlike some of our competitors, we have not installed batteries at customer premises to provide emergency power for our customers\u2019 equipment if they lose power, although we do have backup power systems for our network equipment and service platform.\n>\nOur customers may experience lower call quality than they are used to from traditional wireline telephone companies, including static, echoes, and delays in transmissions.\n>\nOur customers may experience higher dropped-call rates than they are used to from traditional wireline telephone companies.\n>\nCustomers who obtain new phone numbers from us do not appear in the phone book and their phone numbers are not available through directory assistance services offered by traditional telephone companies.\n>\nOur customers cannot accept collect calls.\n>\nOur customers cannot call premium-rate telephone numbers such as 1-900 numbers and 976 numbers.\nIf customers do not accept the differences between our service and traditional telephone service, they may choose to remain with their current telephone service provider or may choose to return to service provided by traditional telephone companies.\nThe debt agreements governing our financing contain restrictions that may limit our flexibility in operating our business or executing on our acquisition strategy.\nOn July 27, 2015, we entered into a credit agreement (the \u201c2015 Credit Facility\u201d) consisting of a $100,000 senior secured term loan and a $250,000 revolving credit facility. The 2015 Credit Facility contains customary representations and warranties and affirmative covenants that limit our ability and/or the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants and other restrictions may under certain circumstances limit, but not necessarily preclude, our and certain of our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things:\n>\nconsolidate or merge;\n>\ncreate liens;\n>\nincur additional indebtedness;\n>\ndispose of assets;\n>\nconsummate acquisitions;\n>\nmake investments; or\n>\npay dividends and other distributions.\nUnder the 2015 Credit Facility, we are required to comply with the following financial covenants: specified maximum consolidated leverage ratio, specified minimum consolidated fixed coverage charge ratio, minimum cash position and maximum capital expenditures. Our ability to comply with such financial and other covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, so we may not be able to comply with these covenants. A breach of any such covenant could result in a default under the 2015 Credit Facility. In that case, the lenders could elect to declare due and payable immediately all amounts due under the 2015 Credit Facility, including principal and accrued interest.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile, and purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses.\nSecurities markets experience significant price and volume fluctuations. This market volatility, as well as general economic conditions, could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. The trading price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile. Many factors that are beyond our control may significantly affect the market price of our shares. These factors include:\n>\nchanges in our earnings or variations in operating results;\n>\nany shortfall in revenue or increase in losses from levels expected by securities analysts;\n>\njudgments in litigation;\n>\noperating performance of companies comparable to us;\n>\ngeneral economic trends and other external factors; and\n>\nmarket conditions and competitive pressures that prevent us from executing on our future growth initiatives.\nIf any of these factors causes the price of our common stock to fall, investors may not be able to sell their common stock at or above their respective purchase prices.\nIf we require additional capital, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all.\nWe may need to pursue additional financing to respond to new competitive pressures, pay extraordinary expenses such as litigation settlements or judgments or fund growth, including through acquisitions. Because of our past significant losses and our limited tangible assets, we do not fit traditional credit lending criteria, which, in particular, could make it difficult for us to obtain loans or to access the capital markets. In addition, the credit documentation for our recent financing contains affirmative and negative covenants that affect, and in many respects may significantly limit or prohibit, among other things, our and certain of our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to incur, refinance or modify indebtedness and create liens.\nOur credit card processors have the ability to impose significant holdbacks in certain circumstances. The reinstatement of such holdbacks likely would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.\nUnder our credit card processing agreements with our Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover credit card processors, the credit card processor has the right, in certain circumstances, including adverse events affecting our business, to impose a holdback of our advanced payments purchased using a Visa, MasterCard, American Express, or Discover credit card, as applicable, or demand additional reserves or other security. If circumstances were to occur that would allow any of these processors to reinstate a holdback, the negative impact on our liquidity likely would be significant. In addition, our Visa and MasterCard credit card processing agreement may be terminated by the credit card processor at its discretion if we are deemed\n16 VONAGE ANNUAL REPORT 2015\nto be financially insecure. As a significant portion of payments to us are made through Visa and MasterCard credit cards, if the credit card processor does not assist in transitioning our business to another credit card processor, the negative impact on our liquidity likely would be significant. There were no cash reserves and cash-collateralized letters of credit with any credit card processors as of December 31, 2015.\nWe have incurred cumulative losses since our inception and may not achieve consistent profitability in the future.\nWhile we achieved net income attributable to Vonage of $22,655 for the year ended December 31, 2015, our accumulated deficit is $655,020 from our inception through December 31, 2015, which included the release of $325,601 of the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets that we recorded as a one-time non-cash income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2011. Although we believe we will achieve consistent profitability in the future, we ultimately may not be successful. We believe that our ability to achieve consistent profitability will depend, among other factors, on our ability to continue to achieve and maintain substantive operational improvements and structural cost reductions while maintaining and growing our net revenues. In addition, certain of the costs of our business are not within our control and may increase. For example, we and other telecommunications providers are subject to regulatory termination charges imposed by regulatory authorities in countries to which customers make calls, such as India where regulatory authorities have been petitioned by local providers to consider termination rate increases. As we attract additional international long distance callers, we will be more affected by these increases to the extent that we are unable to offset such costs by passing through price increases to customers.\nWe may be unable to fully realize the benefits of our net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carry forwards if an ownership change occurs.\nIf we were to experience a \u201cchange in ownership\u201d under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cSection 382\u201d), the NOL carry forward limitations under Section 382 would impose an annual limit on the amount of the future taxable income that may be offset by our NOL generated prior to the change in ownership. If a change in ownership were to occur, we may be unable to use a significant portion of our NOL to offset future taxable income. In general, a change in ownership occurs when, as of any testing date, there has been a cumulative change in the stock ownership of the corporation held by 5% stockholders of more than 50 percentage points over an applicable three-year period. For these purposes, a 5% stockholder is generally any person or group of persons that at any time during an applicable three-year period has owned 5% or more of our outstanding common stock. In addition, persons who own less than 5% of the outstanding common stock are grouped together as one or more \u201cpublic group\u201d 5% stockholders. Under Section 382, stock ownership would be determined under complex attribution rules and generally includes shares held directly, indirectly (though intervening entities), and constructively (by certain related parties and certain unrelated parties acting as a group). We have implemented a Tax Benefits Preservation Plan intended to provide a meaningful deterrent effect against acquisitions that could cause a change in ownership, however this is not a guarantee against such a change in ownership.\nJeffrey A. Citron, our founder, non-executive Chairman, and a significant stockholder, exerts significant influence over us.\nAs of December 31, 2015, Mr. Citron beneficially owned approximately 9.8% of our outstanding common stock, including outstanding securities exercisable for common stock within 60 days of such date. As a result, Mr. Citron is able to exert significant influence over all matters presented to our stockholders for approval, including\nelection and removal of our directors and change of control transactions. In addition, as our non-executive Chairman, Mr. Citron has and will continue to have influence over our strategy and other matters as a board member. Mr. Citron\u2019s interests may not always coincide with the interests of other holders of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws, the agreements governing our indebtedness, and the terms of certain settlement agreements to which we are a party contain provisions that could delay or discourage a takeover attempt, which could prevent the completion of a transaction in which our stockholders could receive a substantial premium over the then-current market price for their shares.\nCertain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and our second amended and restated bylaws may make it more difficult for, or have the effect of discouraging, a third party from acquiring control of us or changing our board of directors and management. These provisions:\n>\npermit our board of directors to issue additional shares of common stock and preferred stock and to establish the number of shares, series designation, voting powers (if any), preferences, other special rights, qualifications, limitations or restrictions of any series of preferred stock;\n>\nlimit the ability of stockholders to amend our restated certificate of incorporation and second amended and restated bylaws, including supermajority requirements;\n>\nallow only our board of directors, Chairman of the board of directors or Chief Executive Officer to call special meetings of our stockholders;\n>\neliminate the ability of stockholders to act by written consent;\n>\nrequire advance notice for stockholder proposals and director nominations;\n>\nlimit the removal of directors and the filling of director vacancies; and\n>\nestablish a classified board of directors with staggered three-year terms.\nIn addition, a change of control would constitute an event of default under our 2015 Credit Facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the lenders could elect to declare due and payable immediately all amounts due under our 2015 Credit Facility, including principal and accrued interest, and may take action to foreclose upon the collateral securing the indebtedness.\nUnder our 2015 Credit Facility, a \u201cchange of control\u201d would result from the occurrence of, among other things, the acquisition by any person or group (other than Mr. Citron and his majority-controlled affiliates) of 35% or more of the voting and/or economic interest of our outstanding common stock on a fully-diluted basis.\nSuch provisions could have the effect of depriving stockholders of an opportunity to sell their shares at a premium over prevailing market prices. Any delay or prevention of, or significant payments required to be made upon, a change of control transaction or changes in our board of directors or management could deter potential acquirors or prevent the completion of a transaction in which our stockholders could receive a substantial premium over the then-current market price for their shares.", "PERMNO": 91237, "SIC": 4899, "TIC": "VG"}
