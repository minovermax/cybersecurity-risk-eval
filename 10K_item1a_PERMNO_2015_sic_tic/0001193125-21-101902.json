Risk Factors\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has caused significant economic dislocation in the United States as many state and local governments have taken preventative or protective actions, such as imposing restrictions on travel and business operations, advising or requiring individuals to limit or forego time outside of their homes, and ordering temporary closures of businesses that have been deemed to be non-essential. This has resulted in a slow-down in economic activity and a related increase in unemployment. Since the COVID-19 outbreak, millions of individuals have filed claims for unemployment. In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, the Federal Reserve Board reduced the benchmark federal funds rate to a target range of 0% to 0.25%, and the yields on 10- and 30-year U.S. Treasury notes have declined to historic lows. Various state governments and federal agencies are requiring lenders to provide forbearance and other relief to borrowers (e.g., waiving late payment and other fees). The federal banking agencies have encouraged financial institutions to prudently work with affected borrowers, and federal legislation has provided relief from reporting loan classifications due to modifications related to the COVID-19 outbreak. Limitations have been placed on our ability to foreclose on properties during the COVID-19 pandemic. Certain industries have been particularly hard-hit, including the travel and hospitality industry, the restaurant industry and the retail industry. Finally, the spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices, including employee travel, employee work locations, and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences. We have employees working remotely as needed and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers and business partners.\nGiven the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances, it is difficult to predict the full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on our business. The extent of such impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, including when the COVID-19 can be controlled and abated. Further, while jurisdictions in which we operate have gradually allowed the re-opening of businesses and other organizations and removed the sheltering restrictions, it is premature to assess whether doing so will result in a meaningful increase in economic activity and the impact of such actions on further COVID-19 cases. As the result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related adverse local and national economic consequences, we could continue to be subject to any of the following risks, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations:\n\u2022\nDemand for our products and services may decline, making it difficult to grow assets and income.\n\u2022\nIf the economy is unable to substantially and successfully reopen, and high levels of unemployment continue for an extended period of time, loan delinquencies, problem assets, and foreclosures may increase, resulting in increased charges and reduced income.\n\u2022\nCollateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, which could cause loan losses to increase.\n\u2022\nOur allowance for loan losses has been and may have to be further increased if borrowers experience financial difficulties beyond forbearance periods, which will adversely affect our net income.\n\u2022\nThe net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us.\n\u2022\nAs the result of the decline in the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s target federal funds rate, the yield on our assets may continue to decline to a greater extent than the decline in our cost of interest-bearing liabilities, further reducing our net interest margin and spread and reducing net income.\n\u2022\nOur cyber security risks are increased as the result of an increase in the number of employees working remotely.\n\u2022\nA worsening of business and economic conditions or in the financial markets could result in an impairment of certain intangible assets. Among other things, a worsening of business and economic conditions could adversely affect our operating results, which, in turn, might require us to recognize an impairment to our deferred tax asset. See \u201c-Risks Related to our Business Strategy - Our ability to recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets is dependent on taxable income.\u201d\n\u2022\nWe are subject to litigation, regulatory enforcement risk and reputation risk regarding our participation in the PPP and the risk that the SBA may not fund some or all PPP loan guarantees.\n\u2022\nThe occurrence of what management would deem to be a triggering event that could, under certain circumstances, cause management to perform impairment testing that could result in an impairment charge being recorded for that period.\n\u2022\nWe rely on third-party vendors for certain services and the unavailability of a critical service due to the COVID-19 outbreak could have an adverse effect on us.\n\u2022\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation premiums may increase if the agency experiences additional resolution costs.\nMoreover, our future success and profitability substantially depends on the management skills of our executive officers and directors, many of whom have held officer and director positions with us for many years. The unanticipated loss or unavailability of key employees due to the outbreak could harm our ability to operate our business or execute our business strategy. We may not be successful in finding and integrating suitable replacements in the event of key employee loss or unavailability.\nAny one or a combination of the factors identified above could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations and prospects.\nRisks Related to our Lending Activities\nWe have a substantial amount of commercial real estate and commercial loans, and intend to continue to increase originations of these types of loans both directly and through participations. These loans involve credit risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAt December 31, 2020, commercial real estate loans (which includes non-owner occupied commercial real estate, multi-family, owner occupied commercial real estate and one- to four-family non-owner occupied real estate loans) totaled $189.3 million, or 57.1% of our loan portfolio, and commercial loans (which includes commercial and industrial loans) totaled $46.2 million, or 13.9% of our loan portfolio. Of this aggregate amount, we had $71.2 million in non-owner occupied non-residential real estate, $65.8 million in multi-family residential real estate, $37.6 million in owner occupied non-residential real estate, $10.2 million in non-owner occupied residential real estate, $4.5 in commercial real estate construction loans, and $1.5 million in commercial land development loans. We intend to increase originations of these types of loans.\nGiven their larger balances and the complexity of the underlying collateral, commercial real estate and commercial loans generally have more risk than the one- to four-family residential real estate loans we originate. Because the repayment of commercial real estate and commercial loans depends on the successful management and operation of the borrower\u2019s properties or related businesses, repayment of such loans can be affected by adverse conditions in the local, regional and national real estate market or economy. A downturn in the real estate market or the local, regional and national economy could adversely impact the value of properties securing the loan or the revenues from the borrower\u2019s business, thereby increasing the risk of non-performing loans. Further, unlike residential mortgage loans, commercial real estate loans and commercial loans may be secured by collateral other than real estate, such as inventory and accounts receivable, the value of which may depreciate over time, may be more difficult to appraise or liquidate and may be more susceptible to fluctuation in value at default. In addition, the physical condition of non-owner occupied properties may be below that of owner occupied properties due to lax property maintenance standards, which have a negative impact on the value of the collateral properties. As our commercial real estate and commercial loan portfolios increase, and to the extent that after the offering we choose to take advantage of our greater lending limit and increase the average size of our commercial real estate loans and commercial loans, the corresponding risks and potential for losses from these loans may also increase.\nOur portfolio of loans with a higher risk of loss is increasing, which may lead to additional provisions for loan losses or charge-offs, which would reduce our profits or cause losses.\nOur commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased to $189.3 million, or 57.1% of total loans, at December 31, 2020 from $178.9 million, or 57.3% of total loans, at December 31, 2019. We intend to continue our emphasis on originating commercial real estate and commercial loan originations. Many of these loans have not been subjected to a prolonged period of unfavorable economic conditions. As a result, it is difficult to predict the future performance of this part of our loan portfolio. These loans may have delinquency or charge-off levels above our historical experience, which could adversely affect our future performance.\nIf our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings could decrease.\nWe make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we review our loans and our loss and delinquency experience, and we evaluate economic conditions. If our assumptions or the results of our analyses are incorrect, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions to our allowance. In addition, our emphasis on loan growth and on increasing our portfolios of commercial real estate and commercial business loans, as well as any future credit deterioration, including as a result of COVID-19, could require us to increase our allowance for loan losses in the future. At December 31, 2020, our allowance for loan losses was 0.82% of total loans and 210.0% of non-performing loans. At December 31, 2020, our allowance for loan losses was 0.86% of total loans (excluding PPP loans) and 210.0% of non-performing loans (excluding PPP loans). Material additions to our allowance would materially decrease our net income.\nIn addition, bank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and, as a result of such reviews, we may be required to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as a result of such review or otherwise may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be required to increase our allowance for credit losses materially when the CECL accounting standard becomes effective for us.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board has delayed the effective date of the implementation of the Current Expected Credit Loss, or \u201cCECL\u201d standard for us until January 1, 2023. CECL will be a significant change from the standard currently applicable to us, because it will require financial institutions to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans and to recognize the expected credit losses as allowances for credit losses. This will change the current method of providing allowances for loan losses that are incurred or probable, which would likely require us to increase our allowance for credit losses, and to greatly increase the types of data we would need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses.\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities or properties we own.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate, and we could become subject to environmental liabilities with respect to one or more of these properties, or with respect to properties that we own in operating our business. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing defaulted loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous conditions or toxic substances are found on these properties, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage, civil fines and criminal penalties regardless of when the hazardous conditions or toxic substances first affected any particular property. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses to address unknown liabilities and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit our ability to use or sell the\naffected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. Our policies, which require us to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on non-residential real property, may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are subject to regulatory enforcement risk and reputation risk regarding our participation in the PPP, we are subject to litigation risk with respect to our participation in the PPP, and we are subject to the risk that the SBA may not fund some or all PPP loan guarantees.\nThe CARES Act included the PPP as a loan program administered through the SBA. Under the PPP, small businesses and other entities and individuals can apply for loans from existing SBA lenders and other lenders, subject to detailed qualifications and eligibility criteria.\nBecause of the short timeframe between the passing of the CARES Act and implementation of the PPP, some of the rules and guidance relating to the PPP were issued after lenders began processing PPP applications. Also, there was and continues to be uncertainty in the laws, rules and guidance relating to the PPP. Since the launch of the PPP, several banks have been subject to litigation regarding the procedures used in processing PPP applications that assisted borrowers in obtaining PPP loans. In addition, some banks and borrowers have received negative media attention associated with PPP loans. Although we believe that we have administered the PPP in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations and guidance, we may be exposed to litigation risk and negative media attention related to our participation in the PPP. If any such litigation is not resolved in in our favor, it may result in significant financial liability to us or adversely affect our reputation. In addition, litigation can be costly, regardless of outcome. Any financial liability, litigation costs or reputational damage caused by PPP-related litigation or media attention could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFederal and state regulators can impose or request that we consent to substantial sanctions, restrictions and requirements if they determine there are violations of laws, rules or regulations or weaknesses or failures with respect to general standards of safety and soundness, including with respect to the PPP, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operation and financial condition, and thereby adversely affect your investment.\nWe also have credit risk on PPP loans if the SBA determines that there is a deficiency in the manner in which we originated, funded or serviced loans, including any issue with the eligibility of a borrower to receive a PPP loan. In the event of a loss resulting from a default on a PPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there was a deficiency in the manner in which we originated, funded or serviced a PPP loan, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty or, if the SBA has already paid under the guaranty, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from us.\nRisks Related to Laws and Regulations\nChanges in laws and regulations and the cost of regulatory compliance with new laws and regulations may adversely affect our operations and/or increase our costs of operations.\nPyraMax Bank is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, MHC and the Company are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve Board. Such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which an institution and its holding company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of the federal deposit insurance fund and the depositors of PyraMax Bank, rather than for our stockholders. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on our operations, the classification of our assets and determination of the adequacy of the level of our allowance for loan losses. These regulations, along with existing tax, accounting, securities, insurance and monetary laws, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations, control the methods by which financial institutions conduct business, implement strategic initiatives and tax compliance, and govern financial reporting and disclosures. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material impact on our operations. Further, changes in accounting standards can be both difficult to predict and involve judgment and discretion in their interpretation by us and our independent accounting firm. These changes could materially impact, potentially even retroactively, how we report our financial condition and results of operations.\nNon-compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, Bank Secrecy Act, or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions.\nThe USA PATRIOT and Bank Secrecy Acts require financial institutions to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If such activities are suspected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury\u2019s Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions, including restrictions on pursuing acquisitions or establishing new branches. The policies and procedures we have adopted that are designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations may not be effective in preventing violations of these laws and regulations. Furthermore, these rules and regulations continue to evolve and expand. We have not been subject to fines or other penalties, nor have we suffered business or reputational harm, as a result of money laundering activities in the past.\nWe are subject to stringent capital requirements, which may adversely impact our return on equity, require us to raise additional capital, or limit our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares.\nFederal regulations establish minimum capital requirements for insured depository institutions, including minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, and define \u201ccapital\u201d for calculating these ratios. The minimum capital requirements are: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6%; (iii) a total capital ratio of 8%; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. The regulations also establish a \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d of 2.5%, and the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 8.5%; and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the capital conservation buffer amount.\nThe application of these capital requirements could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, and result in regulatory actions if we are unable to comply with such requirements. Specifically, PyraMax Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends to the Company will be limited if it does not maintain the capital conservation buffer required by the capital rules, which may further limit the Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends to its stockholders. See \u201cSupervision and Regulation-Federal Banking Regulation-Capital Requirements.\u201d\nThe Federal Reserve Board may require us to commit capital resources to support PyraMax Bank.\nFederal law requires that a holding company act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support such subsidiary bank. Under the \u201csource of strength\u201d doctrine, the Federal Reserve Board may require a holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to a subsidiary bank. A capital injection may be required at times when the holding company may not have the resources to provide it and therefore the holding company may be required to borrow the funds or raise capital. Any loans by a holding company to its subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank. In the event of a holding company\u2019s bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank. Thus, any borrowing that must be done by the Company to make a required capital injection becomes more difficult and expensive and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMonetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to being affected by general economic conditions, our earnings and growth are affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve Board, which regulates the money supply and credit conditions. Among the instruments used by the Federal Reserve Board to implement these objectives are open market purchases and sales of U.S. government securities, adjustments of the discount rate and changes in banks\u2019 reserve requirements against bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.\nThe monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board have had a significant effect on the operating results of financial institutions in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The effects of such policies upon our business, financial condition and results of operations cannot be predicted.\nWe are an emerging growth company, and any decision on our part to comply only with certain reduced reporting and disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nThe Company is an emerging growth company. For as long as the Company continues to be an emerging growth company, it may choose to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As an emerging growth company, the Company also is not subject to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which would require that our independent auditors review and attest as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We have also elected to use the extended transition period to delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of public companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. Investors may find our common stock less attractive since we have chosen to rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of any choices to reduce future disclosure, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and the price of our common stock may be more volatile.\nRisks Related to Market Interest Rates\nA continuation of the historically low interest rate environment may adversely affect our net interest income and profitability.\nIn recent years the Federal Reserve Board has maintained interest rates at historically low levels through its targeted federal funds rate and the purchase of mortgage-backed securities. Our ability to reduce our interest expense may be limited at current interest rate levels while the average yield on our interest-earning assets may continue to decrease. A continuation of a low interest rate environment may adversely affect our net interest income, which would have an adverse effect on our profitability.\nFuture changes in interest rates could reduce our profits and asset values.\nNet interest income makes up a majority of our income and is based on the difference between (i) the interest income we earn on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities, and (ii) the interest expense we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings.\nThe rates we earn on our assets and the rates we pay on our liabilities are generally fixed for a contractual period of time. Like many savings institutions, our interest-bearing liabilities generally have shorter contractual maturities than our interest-earning assets. This imbalance can create significant earnings volatility because market interest rates change over time. In a period of rising interest rates, the interest income we earn on our assets may not increase as rapidly as the interest we pay on our liabilities. In a period of declining interest rates, the interest income we earn on our assets may decrease more rapidly than the interest we pay on our liabilities, as borrowers prepay mortgage loans, and mortgage-backed securities and callable investment securities are called, requiring us to reinvest those cash flows at lower, current interest rates.\nThis creates reinvestment risk, which is the risk that we may not be able to reinvest prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates we earned on the prepaid loans or securities. Furthermore, an inverted interest rate yield curve, where short-term interest rates (which are usually the rates at which financial institutions borrow funds) are higher than long-term interest rates (which are usually the rates at which financial institutions lend funds for fixed-rate loans) can reduce a financial institution\u2019s net interest margin and create financial risk for financial institutions that originate longer-term, fixed rate mortgage loans.\nAny substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Changes in the level of interest rates also may negatively affect the value of our assets and ultimately affect our earnings.\nWe monitor interest rate risk through the use of simulation models, including estimates of the amounts by which the fair value of our assets and liabilities (our economic value of equity or \u201cEVE\u201d) and our net interest income would change in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates. As of December 31, 2020, in the event of an instantaneous 200 basis point increase in interest rates, we estimate that we would experience a 17.3% increase in EVE and a 14.0% increase in net interest income. For further discussion of how changes in interest rates could impact us, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Management of Market Risk.\u201d\nRisks Related to our Business Strategy\nOur business strategy includes managed growth, and our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively. Growing our operations could also cause our expenses to increase faster than our revenues.\nOur business strategy includes growth in loans and deposits. Achieving such growth will require us to attract customers that currently bank at other financial institutions in our market area. Our ability to successfully grow will depend on a variety of factors, including the ability of our executive officers to execute our business strategy to increase commercial real estate and commercial loans and to increase our new and existing customers\u2019 deposit relationships, our ability to attract and retain experienced bankers, the continued availability of desirable business opportunities, competition from other financial institutions in our market area and our ability to manage our growth. Growth opportunities may not be available or we may not be able to manage our growth successfully. If we do not manage our growth effectively, our financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected. Furthermore, there can be considerable costs involved in expanding lending capacity, and generally a period of time is required to generate the necessary revenues to offset these costs, especially in areas in which we do not have an established presence. Accordingly, any such business expansion can be expected to negatively impact our earnings unless and until the expected benefits of such growth are achieved.\nWe depend on our management team to implement our business strategy and execute successful operations and we could be harmed by the loss of their services.\nWe depend on the services of the members of our senior management team who direct our strategy and operations. Our executive officers and lending personnel possess substantial expertise, extensive knowledge of our markets and key business relationships, and have been integral in the restructuring of our operations, including the implementation of a more aggressive sales culture within our institution. Any one of them could be difficult to replace. Our loss of these persons, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, or our inability to hire additional qualified personnel, could impact our ability to implement our business strategy and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our ability to compete in our markets. See \u201cManagement.\u201d\nThe time to integrate our recently appointed executive officer may adversely affect our ability to timely institute changes necessary to react to competition.\nWe recently appointed David R. Ball as President and Chief Operating Officer and a director of the Company and PyraMax Bank. Mr. Ball was not previously employed by PyraMax Bank. Effectively integrating Mr. Ball into our senior management team will likely take time, and until that integration process is complete, our ability to timely institute changes necessary to react to competition may be adversely affected and could reduce our net income.\nOur utilization of time deposits, including brokered certificates of deposit, as a source of funds for loans and our other liquidity needs could have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe rely primarily on deposits for funds to make loans and provide for our other liquidity needs, including time deposits and brokered certificates of deposit. As of December 31, 2020, brokered deposits represented approximately 1.5% of our total deposits. Such deposits may not be as stable as other types of deposits and, in the future, depositors may not renew those time deposits when they mature, or we may have to pay a higher rate of interest to attract or keep them or to replace them with other deposits or with funds from other sources. Not being able to attract those deposits or to keep or replace them as they mature would adversely affect our liquidity. Additionally, we are regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which requires us to maintain certain capital levels to be considered \u201cwell capitalized.\u201d If we fail to maintain these capital levels, we could lose our ability to obtain funding through brokered deposits. In addition, we may also be restricted from paying higher deposit rates to attract, keep or replace those deposits, which could have a negative effect on our operating results and the value of our common stock.\nOur cost of operations is high relative to our revenues.\nThe cost of generating our income is measured by our efficiency ratio (the ratio of non-interest expense to the sum of net interest income and non-interest income). Our efficiency ratio was 83.7% and 97.3% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our efficiency ratio lags our peer group as our competitors for loans and deposits are often larger banks who can offer very competitive terms to originate and retain commercial real estate and commercial loans, as well as very competitive rates on deposit products. Additionally, our interest expense is higher than our peer group as our sources of funding tend to rely on FHLB advances more than our competitors. We have also had a series of significant one-time expenses over the last several years, including core data processing conversion, branch sale costs and expenses related to our self-insured healthcare coverage. .\nWe face additional risks due to our mortgage banking activities that could negatively impact net income and liquidity.\nWe sell the majority of the fixed-rate conforming and eligible jumbo one-to four-family residential real estate loans that we originate. The sale of these loans generates noninterest income and are a source of liquidity for us. Disruption in the secondary market for residential mortgage loans could result in our inability to sell mortgage loans, which could negatively impact our liquidity position and earnings. In addition, declines in real estate values or increases in interest rates could reduce the potential for robust mortgage originations, which could negatively impact our earnings. As we do sell mortgage loans, we also face the risk that such loans may have been made in breach of our representations and warranties to the buyers and we could be forced to repurchase such loans or pay other damages.\nGain on sales of loans comprises a significant portion of our revenue.\nOur net gain on sales of loans constitutes a meaningful component of our revenue. The gain on such sales for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $3.5 million and $715,000, respectively. Any increase in market interest rates may reduce our mortgage loan originations, resulting in fewer loans available for sale. This would result in a decrease in our non-interest income. Further, when we sell loans, we are required to make customary representations and warranties about such loans to the purchaser. Our loan sale agreements may require us to repurchase or substitute mortgage loans or indemnify investors if we breach certain representations and warranties made to purchasers. In addition, we may be required to repurchase loans as a result of borrower fraud or in the event of a payment default on a mortgage loan shortly after its sale. Any of the foregoing could harm our business, cash flow, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur ability to recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets is dependent on taxable income.\nThe Company records deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.\nWe recognize the expected future tax benefit from deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the tax benefit will be realized. Otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied against deferred tax assets, reducing the value of such assets. Assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant estimates related to expectations of future taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecasted income from operations and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction.\nEach quarter, the Company assesses its deferred tax asset position, including the recoverability of this asset or the need for a valuation allowance. This assessment takes into consideration positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that a portion of the asset will not be realized. If the Company is not able to recognize deferred tax assets in future periods, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nNew lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks.\nFrom time to time, we may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. In addition, we will continue to make investments in research, development, and marketing for new products and services. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services we may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the development and introduction of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. Furthermore, if customers do not perceive our new offerings as providing significant value, they may fail to accept our new products and services. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. Furthermore, the burden on management and our information technology of introducing any new line of business and/or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAcquisitions may disrupt our business and dilute stockholder value.\nWe evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities with other financial institutions and financial services companies. As a result, negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions with consideration consisting of cash, debt, and/or equity securities may occur at any time. We would seek acquisition partners that offer us either significant market presence or the potential to expand our market footprint and improve profitability through economies of scale or expanded services.\nAcquiring other banks, businesses, or branches may have an adverse effect on our financial results and may involve various other risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among other things:\n\u2022\ndifficulty in estimating the value of the target company;\n\u2022\npayment of a premium over book and market values that may dilute our tangible book value and earnings per share in the short and long term;\n\u2022\npotential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company;\n\u2022\nexposure to potential asset quality problems of the target company;\n\u2022\npotential volatility in reported income associated with goodwill impairment losses;\n\u2022\ndifficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the target company;\n\u2022\ninability to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits of the acquisition;\n\u2022\npotential disruption to our business;\n\u2022\npotential diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention;\n\u2022\nthe possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company; and\n\u2022\npotential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the target company.\nRisks Related to Economic Conditions\nA worsening of economic conditions in our market area could reduce demand for our products and services and/or result in increases in our level of non-performing loans, which could adversely affect our operations, financial condition and earnings.\nLocal economic conditions have a significant impact on the ability of our borrowers to repay loans and the value of the collateral securing loans. A deterioration in economic conditions, especially local conditions, as a result of COVID-19 or otherwise, could have the following consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, and could more negatively affect us compared to a financial institution that operates with more geographic diversity:\n\u2022\nDemand for our products and services may decline.\n\u2022\nLoan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures may increase.\n\u2022\nCollateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, thereby reducing customers\u2019 future borrowing power, and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with existing loans.\n\u2022\nThe net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us.\nMoreover, a significant decline in general economic conditions caused by inflation, recession, acts of terrorism, civil unrest, an outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic calamities, an epidemic or pandemic, unemployment or other factors beyond our control could further impact these local economic conditions and could further negatively affect the financial results of our banking operations. In addition, deflationary pressures, while possibly lowering our operating costs, could have a significant negative effect on our borrowers, especially our business borrowers, and the values of underlying collateral securing loans, which could negatively affect our financial performance.\nRisks Related to Competitive Matters\nStrong competition within our market area may limit our growth and profitability.\nCompetition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. We compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, brokerage and investment banking firms and unregulated or less regulated non-banking entities. Many of these competitors are substantially larger than us and have substantially greater resources and higher lending limits than we have and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide. In addition, some of our competitors offer loans with lower interest rates and/or more attractive terms than loans we offer. Competition also makes it increasingly difficult and costly to attract and retain qualified employees. We expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete for business and qualified employees in our market areas. The greater resources and deposit and loan products offered by some of our competitors may limit our ability to increase our interest-earning assets. For additional information see \u201cBusiness of PyraMax Bank, FSB-Competition.\u201d\nOur small size may make it more difficult for us to compete.\nOur small asset size may make it more difficult to compete with other financial institutions that are larger and can more easily afford to invest in the marketing and technologies needed to attract and retain customers. Because our principal source of income is the net interest income we earn on our loans and investments after deducting interest paid on deposits and other sources of funds, our ability to generate the revenues needed to cover our expenses and finance such investments is limited by the size of our loan and investment portfolios. Accordingly, we are not always able to offer new products and services as quickly as our competitors. Lower earnings may also make it more difficult to offer competitive salaries and benefits. In addition, our smaller customer base may make it difficult to generate meaningful non-interest income from such activities as securities and insurance brokerage. Finally, as a smaller institution, we are disproportionately affected by the continually increasing costs of compliance with new banking and other regulations.\nTechnology has made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products and made it possible for technology companies to compete with financial institutions in providing electronic, internet-based, and mobile phone-based financial solutions.\nTechnology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services, such as loans and payment services, that traditionally were banking products, and made it possible for technology companies to compete with financial institutions in providing electronic, internet-based, and mobile phone-based financial solutions. Competition with non-banks, including financial technology (\u201cfintech\u201d) companies, to provide financial products and services is intensifying. In particular, the activity of fintechs has grown significantly over recent years and is expected to continue to grow. In addition to fintechs, the large technology companies have begun to make efforts toward providing financial services directly to their customers and are expected to continue to explore new ways to do so. Many of these companies have fewer regulatory constraints, and some have lower cost structures, in part due to lack of physical locations. Some of these companies also have greater resources to invest in technological improvements than we currently have. Competition from non-banks and technology companies may cause us to increase the amount we spend on developing new products and services, including our mobile banking applications. Such competition may also prevent us from achieving our growth objectives.\nRisks Related to Operational Matters\nWe face significant operational risks because of our reliance on technology. Our information technology systems may be subject to failure, interruption or security breaches.\nInformation technology systems are critical to our business. Our business requires us to collect, process, transmit and store significant amounts of confidential information regarding our customers, employees and our own business, operations, plans and business strategies. We use various technology systems to manage our customer relationships, general ledger, securities investments, deposits, and loans. Our computer systems, data management and internal processes, as well as those of third parties, are integral to our performance. Our operational risks include the risk of malfeasance by employees or persons outside our company, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, systems failures or interruptions, breaches of our internal control systems and compliance requirements, and business continuation and disaster recovery. There have been increasing efforts by third parties to breach data security at financial institutions. Such attacks include computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, phishing attacks, denial of service or information or other security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary and other information, damages to systems, or other material disruptions to network access or business operations. Although we take protective measures and believe that we have not experienced any of the data breaches described above, the security of our computer systems, software, and networks may be vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses, or other malicious code and cyber-attacks that could have an impact on information security. Because the techniques used to cause security breaches change frequently, we may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.\nIn the event of a breakdown in our internal control systems, improper operation of systems or improper employee actions, or a breach of our security systems, including if confidential or proprietary information were to be mishandled, misused or lost, we could suffer financial loss, loss of customers and damage to our reputation, and face regulatory action or civil litigation. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Insurance coverage may not be available for such losses, or where available, such losses may exceed insurance limits.\nIn addition, we outsource a majority of our data processing requirements to third-party providers. Accordingly, our operations are exposed to the risk that these vendors will not perform in accordance with our contractual agreements with them, or we also could be adversely affected if such an agreement is not renewed by the third-party vendor or is renewed on terms less favorable to us. If our third-party providers encounter difficulties, or if we have difficulty communicating with those service providers, our ability to adequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and our business operations could be adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other vendors and their personnel. To our knowledge, the services and programs provided to us by third parties have not experienced any material security breaches. However, the existence of cyber-attacks or security breaches at third parties with access to our data, such as vendors, may not be disclosed to us in a timely manner.\nWe may not be able to successfully implement future information technology system enhancements, which could adversely affect our business operations and profitability.\nWe invest significant resources in information technology system enhancements in order to provide functionality and security at an appropriate level. We may not be able to successfully implement and integrate future system enhancements, which could adversely impact the ability to provide timely and accurate financial information in compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, which could result in sanctions from regulatory authorities. Such sanctions could include fines and suspension of trading in our stock, among others. In addition, future system enhancements could have higher than expected costs and/or result in operating inefficiencies, which could increase the costs associated with the implementation as well as ongoing operations.\nFailure to properly utilize system enhancements that are implemented in the future could result in impairment charges that adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations and could result in significant costs to remediate or replace the defective components. In addition, we may incur significant training, licensing, maintenance, consulting and amortization expenses during and after systems implementations, and any such costs may continue for an extended period of time.\nOur funding sources may prove insufficient to replace deposits at maturity and support our future growth.\nWe must maintain sufficient funds to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers. As a part of our liquidity management, we use a number of funding sources in addition to deposit growth and repayments and maturities of loans and investments. As we continue to grow, we are likely to become more dependent on these sources, which may include FHLB advances, proceeds from the sale of loans, federal funds purchased and brokered certificates of deposit. Adverse operating results or changes in industry conditions could lead to difficulty or an inability to access these additional funding sources. Our financial flexibility will be severely constrained if we are unable to maintain our access to funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate future growth at acceptable interest rates. If we are required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources to support future growth, our revenues may not increase proportionately to cover our costs. In this case, our operating margins and profitability would be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Accounting Matters\nChanges in management\u2019s estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and our financial condition or operating results.\nIn preparing our periodic reports, as well as periodic reports we will be required to file under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including our consolidated financial statements, our management is and will be required under applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and assumptions as of a specified date. These estimates and assumptions are based on management\u2019s best estimates and experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. Materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. Areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include our evaluation of the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses, fair value measurement (including the value of our mortgage servicing rights), valuation allowances associated with the realization of deferred tax assets and our determinations with respect to amounts owed for income taxes.\nChanges in accounting standards could affect reported earnings.\nThe bodies responsible for establishing accounting standards, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulatory bodies, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting guidance that governs the preparation of our financial statements. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply new or revised guidance retroactively.\nOur internal controls, procedures and policies may fail or be circumvented.\nManagement regularly reviews and updates our internal controls and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well-designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Our recent shift to a remote working model due to COVID-19 has required us to modify some of these controls, which are approved in advance by management and reviewed by the financial reporting internal controls manager and through internal audits. Similar to our other systems of controls, these new modifications can provide only reasonable assurances that the objectives of the system are being met. Any failure or circumvention of the controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOther Risks Related to Our Business\nWe are a community bank and our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to the success of our business. The failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance.\nWe are a community bank, and our reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business. A key component of our business strategy is to rely on our reputation for customer service and knowledge of local markets to expand our presence by capturing new business opportunities from existing and prospective customers in our market area and contiguous areas. Threats to our reputation can come from many sources, including adverse sentiment about financial institutions generally, unethical practices, employee misconduct, failure to deliver minimum standards of service or quality, compliance deficiencies, cybersecurity incidents and questionable or fraudulent activities of our customers. Negative publicity regarding our business, employees, or customers, with or without merit, may result in the loss of customers and employees, costly litigation and increased governmental regulation, any or all of which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe will be required to transition from the use of the LIBOR interest rate index in the future.\nWe have certain loans indexed to the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) to calculate the loan interest rate. As of December 31, 2020, we have extended credit to four customers totaling $8.2 million indexed to the LIBOR. LIBOR will be discontinued on December 31, 2021. At this time, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates may become acceptable alternatives to LIBOR. Regulators, industry groups and certain committees (e.g. the Alternative Reference Rates Committee) have published recommended fallback language for LIBOR-linked financial instruments, identified recommended alternatives for the LIBOR (e.g. the Secured Overnight Financing Rate), and proposed implementations of the recommended alternatives in floating-rate financial instruments. At this time, it is not possible to predict whether these specific recommendations and proposals will be broadly accepted. The implementation of a substitute index or indices for the calculation of interest rates under our loan agreements with our borrowers may result in our incurring significant expenses in effecting the transition, may result in reduced loan balances if borrowers do not accept the substitute index or indices, and may result in disputes or litigation with customers over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the substitute index or indices, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nLegal and regulatory proceedings and related matters could adversely affect us.\nWe have been and may in the future become involved in legal and regulatory proceedings. We consider most of the proceedings to be in the normal course of our business or typical for the industry; however, it is inherently difficult to assess the outcome of these matters, and we may not prevail in any proceedings or litigation. There could be substantial costs and management diversion in such litigation and proceedings, and any adverse determination could have a materially adverse effect on our business, reputation, or our financial condition and results of our operations.\nSocietal responses to climate change could adversely affect our business and performance, including indirectly through impacts on our customers.\nConcerns over the long-term impacts of climate change have led and will continue to lead to governmental efforts around the world to mitigate those impacts. Consumers and businesses also may change their behavior as a result of these concerns. We and our customers will need to respond to new laws and regulations as well as consumer and business preferences resulting from climate change concerns. The impact on our customers will likely vary depending on their specific attributes, including reliance on or role in carbon intensive activities. Among the impacts to us could be a drop in demand for our products and services, particularly in certain sectors. In addition, we could face reductions in creditworthiness on the part of some customers or in the value of assets securing loans. Our efforts to take these risks into account in making lending and other decisions, including by increasing our business with climate-friendly companies, may not be effective in protecting us from the negative impact of new laws and regulations or changes in consumer or business behavior.\nOur stock-based benefit plans will increase our costs, which will reduce our net income.\nOur employee stock ownership plan purchased 175,528 shares of common stock in the stock offering. We will record annual employee stock ownership plan expenses in an amount equal to the fair value of shares of common stock committed to be released to employees. If shares of common stock appreciate in value over time, compensation expense relating to the employee stock ownership plan will increase.\nWe also adopted a stock-based benefit plan, under which participants may be awarded shares of restricted common stock (at no cost to them) and/or options to purchase shares of our common stock. Under federal regulations, we are authorized to grant awards of stock or options under a stock-based benefit plan in an amount up to 25% of the shares of common stock held by persons other than 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, MHC. The number of shares of restricted stock or options granted under any initial stock-based benefit plan may not exceed 1.96% and 4.90%, respectively, of our total outstanding shares, including shares issued to 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, MHC and contributed to the charitable foundation. The shares of restricted common stock granted under the stock-based benefit plan will be expensed by us over their vesting period based on the fair market value of the shares on the date they are awarded and may lead to a reduction to stockholders\u2019 equity. We will generally recognize as an expense in our income statement the grant-date fair value of stock options as such options vest. When we record an expense related to the grant of options using the fair value method, we will incur significant compensation and benefits expense.\nThe implementation of a stock-based benefit plan may dilute your ownership interest.\nWe adopted a stock-based benefit plan, following shareholder approval that will be funded through either open market purchases, if permitted, or from the issuance of authorized but unissued shares. Public stockholders would experience a reduction in ownership interest totaling 6.31% in the event newly issued shares are used to fund stock options and restricted stock awards in an amount equal to 4.90% and 1.96%, respectively, of the total shares issued in the mutual holding company reorganization and stock offering (including shares issued to 1895 Bancorp of Wisconsin, MHC and the charitable foundation).\nOur contribution to the charitable foundation may not be tax deductible, which could reduce our profits.\nWe may not have sufficient profits to be able to fully use the tax deduction from our contribution to the charitable foundation. Under the Internal Revenue Code, an entity is permitted to deduct up to 10% of its taxable income (generally income before federal income taxes and charitable contributions expense) in any one year for charitable contributions. Any contribution in excess of the 10% limit may be deducted for federal income tax purposes over each of the five years following the year in which the charitable contribution is made. Accordingly, a charitable contribution could, if necessary, be deducted over a six-year period and expires thereafter. The CARES Act temporarily increased the 10% limitation to 25% for charitable contributions made in the calendar year ended December 31, 2020.", "PERMNO": 18356, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "BCOW"}
