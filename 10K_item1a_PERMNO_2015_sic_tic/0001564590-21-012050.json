maintain our sales and marketing capabilities; train and equip our sales force; enter into agreements with third parties that satisfactorily market, distribute, or sell that product; and obtain adequate third-party payer coverage and reimbursement and will be adversely impacted by unfavorable third-party guidelines or recommendations and any generic competition.\n\u2022\nOur clinical development efforts depend on the satisfactory performance by third parties on which we rely in conducting our preclinical studies and clinical trials and will take a long time, be subject to delays, be expensive, and may ultimately prove unsuccessful.\n\u2022\nWe rely completely on a limited number of third parties, including certain sole sources of supply, to manufacture our commercial supplies of ZILRETTA and our preclinical and clinical drug supplies for our product candidates, and any failure on their part could impact our sales, research and development, and regulatory approval efforts and increase our costs.\n\u2022\nWe may not be successful in establishing and maintaining effective development and commercialization collaborations, and our partners may fail in development or commercialization efforts, which could adversely affect our ability to develop or commercialize products and our financial condition and operating results.\n\u2022\nOur clinical study results do not guarantee similar efficacy following commercialization.\n\u2022\nThe regulatory approval process for our product candidates is lengthy, time-consuming, and unpredictable.\n\u2022\nWe are subject to substantial ongoing regulatory requirements and may face development and regulatory difficulties.\n\u2022\nRelationships with healthcare professionals, clinical investigators, consultants, actual and potential customers, and third-party payers are and will continue to be subject to healthcare laws.\n\u2022\nNew legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to commercialize any product we may offer, affect the prices we may obtain, and increase the time, effort, and cost involved in regulatory compliance.\n\u2022\nWe could face liability if a regulatory authority determines that we are promoting a product for any off-label uses.\n\u2022\nWe may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights and face ongoing risks from patent litigation, allegations by third parties that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, and claims of breach of intellectual property licensing agreements or confidentiality obligations.\n\u2022\nWe face significant competition, including from well-established biopharmaceutical companies, which may harm our business.\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to retain key executives and to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel.\n\u2022\nWe are at risk of product liability claims, general and securities class action litigation, and penalties associated with regulatory enforcement.\n\u2022\nFailure to comply with applicable privacy and data protection laws and regulations may subject us to liabilities that adversely affect our business, operations, and financial performance.\n\u2022\nWe are subject to a variety of risks associated with international operations, including geopolitical events, pandemics, natural disasters, and foreign exchange rates.\n\u2022\nFailure, inadequacy, interruption, or security lapse of our information technology could harm our ability to operate our business effectively and subject us to liability.\n\u2022\nThe market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and is subject to substantial sales of shares of our common stock by our stockholders or our sale of securities to fund our operations, which may also dilute our stockholders and impose additional restrictions on our business.\n\u2022\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock, so any returns will be limited to the value of our stock.\n\u2022\nFailure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting may lead to inaccurate reports of our financial results or allow fraud, which could harm our business and the trading price of our common stock.\n\u2022\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\n\u2022\nProvisions in our organization documents and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us and may prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nRisk Factors:\nYou should consider carefully the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The risks and uncertainties below are those identified by us as material, but there are also additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of that may become important factors that affect us. If any of the following risks occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future growth prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected, and the market price of our common stock would likely decline.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition and Need for Additional Capital\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses over the next few years.\nWe have a limited operating history. To date, we have focused primarily on developing our commercialized product, ZILRETTA. Our current and future product candidates will require substantial development time and resources before we would be able to apply for or receive regulatory approvals and begin generating revenue from product sales. We have incurred significant net losses in each year since our inception, including significant net losses in each of the three immediately preceding years, and expect to incur net losses over the next few years as we continue to invest in the commercialization of ZILRETTA and advance our development programs.\nWe have devoted most of our financial resources to product development and commercialization. To date, we have financed our operations almost exclusively through the sale of equity securities and debt. The size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future expenditures and our ability to generate revenue. We launched commercial sales of ZILRETTA in the fourth quarter of 2017, and, in light of our limited commercial history, cannot guarantee that our commercialization efforts will result in product revenues that meet our peak sales expectations or those of analysts and investors.\nSince first reported in December 2019, the novel strain of coronavirus that causes the COVID-19 disease (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) has become a global pandemic. Many governments have implemented various \u201csocial distancing\u201d and \u201cstay at home\u201d measures to mitigate the continued spread of COVID-19. ZILRETTA is required to be administered by healthcare professionals, and, since mid-March 2020, COVID-19 has resulted in limited patient access to physician offices and clinics as healthcare practices have implemented varying responses to the pandemic. Although many practices have reopened, some have limited in-person patient visits. In addition, we believe that many patients have been reluctant to visit physician offices and clinics due to fear of contracting COVID-19. While COVID-19 vaccines, which were first introduced in December 2020, will likely moderate these effects on patient visit rates over time, patients\u2019 ability to access and willingness to use these vaccines, the degree of vaccine efficacy, and the emergence of new viral strains will influence the rate of change, and restrictions on the administration of other medicines, including ZILRETTA, within a number of days of a COVID-19 vaccination may further reduce the frequency of ZILRETTA\u2019s administration. As a result of these adverse impacts on the operations of healthcare providers who administer ZILRETTA to patients and patients\u2019 willingness to make in-person visits to healthcare facilities, we have experienced and, in combination with restrictions associated with COVID-19 vaccine administration, may continue experiencing a meaningful diminution in revenue as compared to our prior expectations.\nWe also expect to continue to incur substantial expenses as we invest in the further commercialization of ZILRETTA, further scale up commercial manufacturing of ZILRETTA, conduct additional clinical trials for it and our product candidates, and continue our development activities with respect to our product pipeline. As a result, we expect to continue to incur significant losses and negative cash flows over the next few years.\nOur revenues may not be sufficient to cover our future expenses, and we may never be profitable.\nOur ability to generate significant revenue and achieve profitability depends primarily on our ability to successfully commercialize ZILRETTA and to obtain regulatory approval for and then successfully commercialize our product candidates. We may never succeed in these activities and may never generate revenues that are significant enough to achieve profitability.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with new pharmaceutical products and development efforts, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses; when, or if, we will begin to generate revenue from product sales sufficient to cover our operating expenses; or when, or if, we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. In addition, despite actions aimed at reducing our operating expenses, our expenses could increase beyond expectations if we determine that additional sales and marketing personnel or other resources are necessary for successful commercialization, if we face any legal or regulatory action related to our commercial activities, or if our development expenses for our product candidates are greater than we expect.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient revenues from product sales or to maintain an acceptable cost structure related to our operations, we may not become profitable and may need to obtain additional funding to continue operations.\nIf we fail to obtain additional financing, we may be forced to delay, reduce, or eliminate our product development programs and commercialization activities.\nDeveloping and commercializing pharmaceutical products, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, and building and maintaining sales and marketing capabilities, is expensive. Changing circumstances may cause us to consume capital more rapidly than we currently anticipate.\nAttempting to secure additional financing may divert our management from our day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates. In addition, we cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In particular, as a result of COVID-19 and actions taken to slow its spread, the global credit and financial markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruptions, including diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates, and uncertainty about economic stability. These factors may make any additional debt or equity financing more difficult, more costly, and more dilutive. Inability to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms may require us to:\n\u2022\nsignificantly scale back or discontinue our commercialization efforts or the further development of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nseek corporate partners for our product candidates at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available;\n\u2022\nseek corporate partners to assist in commercialization on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available;\n\u2022\nrelinquish, or license on unfavorable terms, our rights to products or product candidates that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves; or\n\u2022\nsignificantly curtail, or cease, operations.\nWe may sell additional equity or debt securities to fund our operations, which may result in dilution to our stockholders and impose restrictions on our business.\nIn order to raise additional funds to support our operations, we may sell additional equity or debt securities, which could adversely impact our stockholders as well as our business. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would result in the issuance of additional shares of our capital stock and dilution to all of our stockholders. The incurrence of debt would result in increased fixed payment obligations and could also result in certain restrictive covenants-such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt or acquire, sell, or license intellectual property rights-that would adversely impact our ability to conduct business.\nOur existing indebtedness contains restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business. In addition, we may be required to make a prepayment or repay our outstanding indebtedness earlier than we expect.\nOn August 2, 2019, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit and Security Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank, MidCap Financial Trust, and Flexpoint MCLS Holdings, LLC, or the Credit Agreement, which provides for a term loan of $40.0 million and a revolving credit facility up to $20.0 million. We concurrently drew down the $40.0 million term loan and used $7.7 million of the proceeds to repay the remaining amount owed on our prior credit facility. In February 2020, we drew down $20.0 million from the revolving credit facility. On May 18, 2020, we entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement pursuant to which we borrowed $15.0 million under a new term loan advance and immediately used the proceeds to repay an equal amount under the revolving credit facility, and the maximum principal amount of the revolving credit facility was reduced from $20.0 million to $5.0 million. The new term loan is subject to substantially the same terms, including interest rate, amortization, and maturity date, as the existing term loan under the credit facility. The Credit Agreement contains various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur or assume certain debt;\n\u2022\nmerge or consolidate or acquire all or substantially all of the capital stock or property of another entity;\n\u2022\nenter into any transaction or series of related transactions that would be deemed to result in a change in control of us under the terms of the agreement;\n\u2022\nchange the nature of our business;\n\u2022\nchange our organizational structure or type;\n\u2022\namend, modify, or waive any of our organizational documents;\n\u2022\nlicense, transfer, or dispose of certain assets;\n\u2022\ngrant certain types of liens on our assets;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments;\n\u2022\npay cash dividends;\n\u2022\nenter into material transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\namend or waive provisions of material agreements in certain manners.\nUnder the Credit Agreement, as amended, we are subject to a minimum liquidity threshold, such that at any time our liquidity is below $80.0 million, we will become subject to a minimum revenue covenant. The minimum liquidity threshold includes certain accounts receivable as deemed eligible under the Credit Agreement, in addition to cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Prior to May 2021, the minimum revenue covenant, if it applies in the future, is unmodified and is based on the greater of (i) a conservative percentage of the year\u2019s approved forecast and (ii) modest growth over the trailing twelve months of actual revenues. Beginning in May 2021, the minimum revenue covenant, if it applies, will be the greatest of (i) a conservative percentage of the year\u2019s approved forecast, (ii) modest growth over the trailing twelve months of actual revenues and (iii) 100% of the minimum revenue covenant amount for the preceding month.\nIf the revenue covenant becomes applicable to us and we fail to meet it, the commitments under the Credit Agreement could be terminated and any outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest, under the Credit Agreement could be declared immediately due and payable. Additionally, if our liquidity is below $80.0 million, all amounts received from customer collections will be applied immediately to reduce the revolving credit facility. The restrictive covenants in the Credit Agreement could prevent us from pursuing business opportunities that we or our stockholders may consider beneficial.\nA breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under the Credit Agreement. An event of default will also occur if, among other things, a material adverse change in our business, operations, or condition occurs, which could potentially include a material impairment of the prospect of our repayment of any portion of the amounts we owe under the Credit Agreement. In the case of a continuing event of default under the Credit Agreement, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable, proceed against the collateral in which we granted the lenders a security interest under the Credit Agreement, or otherwise exercise the rights of a secured creditor. Amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement are secured by all of our existing and future assets, excluding intellectual property, which is subject to a negative pledge arrangement.\nIn April 2017, we also issued $201.3 million principal amount of our 3.375% Convertible Senior Notes due 2024, or the 2024 Convertible Notes. The 2024 Convertible Notes will mature on May 1, 2024, unless earlier redeemed, repurchased, or converted in accordance with the terms of the indenture governing the notes. If specified bankruptcy, insolvency, or reorganization-related events of default occur, or if certain other events of default occur, including a default under the Credit Agreement resulting in an obligation to repay the indebtedness, and the trustee or certain holders of the 2024 Convertible Notes elect, the principal of, and accrued and unpaid interest on, all of the then-outstanding 2024 Convertible Notes will automatically become due and payable. In addition, if we undergo certain fundamental change transactions specified in the indenture governing the 2024 Convertible Notes, the holders of the notes may require us to repurchase their notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest.\nWe may not have enough available cash or be able to raise additional funds on satisfactory terms, if at all, through equity or debt financings to repay or refinance our indebtedness at the time any such repayment or repurchase is required. In such an event, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce, or terminate our product development or commercialization efforts or grant others rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected as a result.\nRisks Related to Commercialization Activities\nOur prospects are highly dependent on the successful commercialization of ZILRETTA. To the extent ZILRETTA is not commercially successful, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nZILRETTA is our only drug that has been approved for sale, and it has only been approved for the management of OA pain of the knee for patients in the United States. We are focusing a significant portion of our activities and resources on ZILRETTA, and we believe our prospects are highly dependent on, and a significant portion of the value of our company relates to, our ability to successfully commercialize ZILRETTA in the United States.\nSuccessful commercialization of ZILRETTA is subject to many risks. We have never, as an organization, commercialized a product prior to ZILRETTA, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so successfully with ZILRETTA for its approved indication. There are numerous examples of failures to meet expectations of market potential, including by pharmaceutical companies with more experience and resources than us.\nMarket acceptance of ZILRETTA and any other product for which we receive approval will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe efficacy and safety as demonstrated in clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe ability to demonstrate the impact of real-world evidence;\n\u2022\nthe timing and market introduction of competitive products;\n\u2022\nthe product label and clinical indications for which the product is approved;\n\u2022\nacceptance by physicians, the medical community, and patients of the product as a safe and effective treatment;\n\u2022\nthe ability to distinguish safety and efficacy from existing, less expensive generic alternative therapies;\n\u2022\nthe convenience of prescribing, administrating, and initiating patients on the product;\n\u2022\nthe potential and perceived advantages or value of the product over alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nthe cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments, including any similar generic treatments;\n\u2022\nthe economics of a buy-and-bill product and discounts and rebates we offer;\n\u2022\nthe availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement by third-party payers and government authorities to support pricing;\n\u2022\nthe prevalence and severity of adverse side effects; and\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts.\nCOVID-19 has adversely impacted our commercialization of ZILRETTA.\nCOVID-19 has severely impacted our commercialization of ZILRETTA. For example, federal, state, and local governments have taken varying preventive and proactive measures to slow the spread of COVID-19. While some healthcare facilities and physician offices, particularly those in major markets, have reopened and rescheduled previously cancelled or postponed non-emergency or elective procedures, COVID-19 cases have increased, and new viral strains have emerged, which may result in additional delays in procedures or otherwise restricted patient visits. Even in those markets where facilities are operating with fewer restrictions, we believe patients continue to be reluctant to seek treatment for fear of contracting COVID-19. These impediments and disruptions in patient care have resulted in a decreased volume of ZILRETTA being administered, which has translated into decreased sales.\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, we are uncertain as to whether states may implement new measures or how healthcare practices will respond. Even in those regions where healthcare operations and patient visits have fully resumed, we expect that it will take some time for activities to return to levels seen before the pandemic. While COVID-19 vaccines, which were first introduced in December 2020, will likely moderate these effects on patient visit rates over time, patients\u2019 ability to access and willingness to use these vaccines, the degree of vaccine efficacy, and the emergence of new viral strains will influence the rate of change, and restrictions on the administration of other medicines, including ZILRETTA, within a number of days of a COVID-19 vaccination may further reduce the frequency of ZILRETTA\u2019s administration. We expect sales of ZILRETTA to continue to be negatively impacted for the foreseeable future until the effects of COVID-19 are fully resolved. It is also possible that a prolonged impact of COVID-19 and the associated reduction of physician office visits could force various healthcare practices, particularly smaller primary care or orthopedic practices, to permanently close or to consolidate with larger practices or healthcare groups, which could cause us to lose previously established physician relationships and set back our efforts to increase adoption of ZILRETTA.\nIf we are unable to differentiate ZILRETTA from existing generic therapies for the treatment of OA, or if the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities approve generic products that compete with ZILRETTA, our ability to successfully commercialize ZILRETTA would be adversely affected.\nImmediate-release TA and other injectable immediate-release steroids, which are the current intra-articular, or IA, standard of care for OA pain, are available in generic form and are therefore relatively inexpensive compared to the pricing for ZILRETTA. These generic steroids also have well-established market positions and familiarity with physicians, healthcare payers, and patients. Although we believe the proven and extended pain relief evidenced in our clinical trials demonstrate that ZILRETTA represents a clinically meaningful and highly efficacious option, it is possible that we will receive data from additional clinical trials or in a post-marketing setting from physician and patient experiences with the commercial product that does not continue to support such interpretations. It is also possible that the FDA, physicians and healthcare payers will not agree with our interpretation of our existing and future clinical trial data. If we are unable to demonstrate the value of ZILRETTA based on our clinical data, patient experience, as well as real-world evidence, our opportunity for ZILRETTA to maintain premium pricing and be commercialized successfully would be adversely affected.\nIn addition to existing generic steroids, such as immediate-release TA, the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities may approve other generic products that could compete with ZILRETTA if we cannot adequately protect it with our patent portfolio. Once an NDA, including a Section 505(b)(2) application, is approved, the product covered thereby becomes a \u201clisted drug,\u201d which can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA. The FDCA, FDA regulations, and other applicable regulations and policies provide incentives to manufacturers to create modified, non-infringing versions of a drug to facilitate the approval of an ANDA or other application for generic substitutes. These manufacturers might only be required to conduct a relatively inexpensive study to\nshow that their product has the same active ingredient(s), dosage form, strength, route of administration, conditions of use, and labeling as our product and that the generic product is bioequivalent to ours, meaning it is absorbed in the body at the same rate and to the same extent. These generic equivalents, which must meet the same quality standards as branded pharmaceuticals, would be significantly less costly than ours to bring to market, and companies that produce generic equivalents are generally able to offer their products at lower prices. Thus, after the introduction of a generic competitor, a significant percentage of the sales of any branded product is typically lost to the generic product. Accordingly, competition from a generic equivalent would materially adversely impact our ability to successfully commercialize our equivalent product.\nWe face significant competition from other biopharmaceutical companies, and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.\nThe biopharmaceutical industries, particularly in the pain and OA market, are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. We have competitors worldwide, including major multinational pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. For example, the injectable OA treatment market today includes many injectable immediate-release steroids, including TA, the active ingredient in ZILRETTA, as well as hyaluronic acid, or HA, injections. Injectable therapies, such as ZILRETTA, are used primarily after oral medications no longer provide adequate pain relief. To the extent that new or improved oral or other systemically administered pain medications are introduced that demonstrate better long-term efficacy and safety, patients and physicians may further delay the introduction of injectable therapies, including ZILRETTA, in the OA treatment continuum. ZILRETTA could also face competition from other formulations or devices that deliver pain medication on an extended basis, such as transdermal delivery systems or implantable devices.\nMany of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources, such as larger research and development staffs and experienced commercial and manufacturing organizations. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors. As a result, these companies may obtain regulatory approval more rapidly than we can and be more effective in selling and marketing their products. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. Competition may increase further as a result of advances in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these industries. Our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring, or licensing on an exclusive basis drug products or drug delivery technologies that are more effective or less costly than our products or product candidates.\nWe believe that our ability to successfully compete will depend on, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe efficacy and safety of our products and product candidates, including relative to third-party products and product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe ability to distinguish safety and efficacy from existing, less expensive generic alternative therapies;\n\u2022\nthe time it takes for our product candidates to complete clinical development and receive marketing approval;\n\u2022\nthe ability to maintain a good relationship with regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nthe ability to commercialize and market our products that receive regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nthe price of our products, including in comparison to branded or generic competitors;\n\u2022\nwhether coverage and adequate levels of reimbursement are available under private and governmental health insurance plans, including Medicare;\n\u2022\nthe ability to protect our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nthe ability to manufacture on a cost-effective basis and sell commercial quantities of our products that receive regulatory approval; and\n\u2022\nacceptance of our products that receive regulatory approval by patients, physicians, and other healthcare providers.\nIf our competitors market products that are more effective, safer, less expensive, or reimbursed at higher rates than ours or offer discounts or rebates that allow physicians to receive more net revenue, we may not achieve commercial success. In addition, the biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapid technological change. Because we have limited research and development capabilities, it may be difficult for us to stay abreast of the rapid changes in each technology. If we fail to stay at the forefront of technological change, we may be unable to compete effectively.\nIf we are unable to maintain sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market, distribute, and sell our products, we may be unable to generate adequate revenue.\nOur strategy is to commercialize ZILRETTA in the United States with a targeted sales and marketing organization. While we have established our commercial team and our sales force, we do not have prior experience commercializing pharmaceutical\nproducts as an organization. In order to successfully market ZILRETTA, we must continue to build and maintain our sales, marketing, managerial, compliance, and related capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services. These efforts will continue to be expensive and time-consuming, and we compete with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to recruit, hire, train, and retain marketing and sales personnel. If we are unable to maintain adequate sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities, whether independently or with third parties, we may not generate significant revenue from ZILRETTA.\nAdditionally, our strategy in the United States includes distributing ZILRETTA through a limited network of third parties. While we have entered into these agreements to purchase or distribute ZILRETTA in the United States, the counterparties may not perform as agreed or may terminate their agreements with us. For example, ZILRETTA sales are concentrated with certain specialty distributors, which together represented the vast majority of our sales for the past two years. Loss of any specialty distributor through contract termination or its failure to distribute effectively would adversely affect product distribution. While we have entered into these agreements on commercially reasonable terms, there is no guarantee that we will be able to continue to do so, if at all.\nWe and any third parties that we may engage in the future will be competing with many companies that currently have extensive and well-funded marketing and sales operations. If we, alone or with commercialization partners, are unable to compete successfully against these established companies, the commercial success of our approved products will be limited. In addition, if we are unable to effectively develop and maintain our commercial team, including our U.S. sales force, or maintain and, if needed, expand, our customer base, our ability to effectively commercialize our products and generate product revenues would be limited.\nCustomer buying patterns and other factors may cause our quarterly results to fluctuate, which may adversely affect our short-term results.\nOur results of operations, and product revenues in particular, may vary from period to period due to a variety of factors, including the buying patterns of our direct purchasers, which vary from quarter to quarter and may be impacted by seasonality (such as in the first quarter of the year when patient deductibles tend to be reset). If our customers limit their product purchases, our sales could be adversely affected. Further, any changes in purchasing patterns or inventory levels, increases in product returns, delays in purchasing products, or delays in payment for products by our customers could also have a negative impact on our revenue and results of operations. In addition, we are unable to predict the long-term impact of COVID-19 and the pace of recovery and how this may impact purchases of ZILRETTA by healthcare providers in the future, as individual providers and their patients may have different responses as the pandemic evolves.\nIf we are unable to effectively train and equip our sales force, our ability to successfully commercialize ZILRETTA will be harmed.\nWe are required to expend significant time and resources to train our sales force to be credible, persuasive, and compliant with applicable laws in marketing ZILRETTA for its approved indication. In addition, we must train our sales force to ensure that an appropriate and compliant message about ZILRETTA is being delivered. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our MBMs have been using a mix of in-person and virtual interactions with physicians to convey key information about ZILRETTA and aid physicians and their staff in prescribing and obtaining reimbursement for ZILRETTA. While we have attempted to maintain the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, it may not be as effective as in the pre-COVID environment, as access to some providers remains limited. If we are unable to maintain an effectively trained sales force and equip them with compliant and effective materials, including medical and sales literature to help them appropriately inform and educate customers regarding the potential benefits and safety of ZILRETTA and its proper administration, our efforts to successfully commercialize ZILRETTA could be jeopardized, which would negatively impact our ability to generate product revenues.\nIf we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate levels of third-party payer coverage and reimbursement for any product we may offer, on reasonable pricing terms, that product\u2019s commercial success may be severely hindered.\nSuccessful sales of ZILRETTA and any other approved product candidates depend on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payers, including governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, managed care organizations, and commercial payers, among others. Patients who are prescribed medicine for the treatment of their conditions generally rely on third-party payers to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. Coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payers are critical to product acceptance. Coverage decisions may depend upon clinical and economic standards that disfavor drug products when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are already available or subsequently become available. The resulting reimbursement payment rates for ZILRETTA and, if approved, our product candidates, might not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high.\nIn addition, the market for any product we may sell may depend significantly on access to third-party payers\u2019 medical policies, drug formularies, or lists of medications for which third-party payers provide coverage and reimbursement, as well as inclusion of that product on the reimbursement policies and formularies used by large physician practices and hospitals. The industry competition to be included in such policies or formularies often leads to downward pricing pressures on pharmaceutical companies, and we may be required to offer discounted rates to certain government and other payers to ensure coverage of our drugs. Also, third-party payers, physician practices, and hospitals may refuse to include a particular branded drug in their policies or formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available, or when the reimbursement landscape is unclear.\nGovernmental and commercial third-party payers are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement, and requirements for substitution of generic products. In addition, in the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payers. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payer to payer, and one payer\u2019s determination to provide coverage for a product does not ensure that other payers also will provide coverage. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly and will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payer separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained.\nFurther, we believe that coverage and reimbursement will likely be increasingly restricted in many or all markets. Third-party coverage and reimbursement for any product we may sell in a particular market may not be available or adequate or may be more limited than the indications for which the drug is approved by other regulatory authorities. Moreover, eligibility for coverage and reimbursement does not imply that a drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sales, and distribution costs. If coverage and reimbursement are not available or only available at limited levels for a product we may sell, we may not be able to successfully commercialize that product, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nGuidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products.\nGovernment agencies promulgate regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us and to our products and product candidates. In addition, professional societies, practice management groups, private health and science foundations, and organizations involved in various diseases from time to time may also publish guidelines or recommendations to the healthcare and patient communities with respect to specific classes of products. Recommendations of government agencies or these other groups or organizations may relate to such matters as usage, dosage, route of administration, and use of concomitant therapies. Recommendations or guidelines that do not recognize a product, suggest limitations or inadequacies of a product, or suggest the use of competitive or alternative products as the standard of care to be followed by patients and healthcare providers could result in decreased use or adoption of any of our products.\nZILRETTA is available to a much larger number of patients and in broader populations through commercial sales as compared to the patients in our clinical studies, and the results of ZILRETTA\u2019s use in such larger context may be inconsistent with the results from our clinical studies.\nWhile the FDA granted approval of ZILRETTA based on the data included in the NDA, we do not know whether the results that served as the basis for the FDA\u2019s approval of ZILRETTA will be consistent with commercial results as a large number of patients and broader populations are exposed to ZILRETTA and are exposed over longer periods of time, including results related to safety and efficacy. New data relating to ZILRETTA, including from adverse event reports or our ongoing studies of ZILRETTA in other indications, may result in additional changes to the product label and may adversely affect sales, or result in withdrawal of ZILRETTA from the market. The FDA and regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions may also consider any new data in connection with further marketing approval applications. If ZILRETTA or any additional approved products cause serious or unexpected side effects after receiving market approval, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including withdrawal of product approval, restrictions on its distribution, additional labeling, changes in promotion or product administration, or a requirement for additional clinical studies. Any of these events could prevent us from maintaining market acceptance of the affected product and could substantially increase the costs of commercializing ZILRETTA or any additional products.\nRecently enacted and future legislation, including health care reform measures, may increase the difficulty and cost for us to commercialize ZILRETTA and any future products and may affect the prices we may obtain.\nThe United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering, or have enacted, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell ZILRETTA and any other products approved for sale profitably. Among policy makers and third-party payers in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality, and expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of\nthese efforts and has been, and may continue to be, significantly affected by major legislative, congressional, and enforcement initiatives. Moreover, in some foreign jurisdictions, pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is already subject to government control.\nFor example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended, or PPACA, was intended to, among other items, broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose taxes and fees on the health industry, and impose additional health policy reforms. Among the PPACA provisions of importance to the pharmaceutical industry are the imposition of additional fees, an increase in required rebates and a change in their method of calculation, discounts to eligible beneficiaries under Medicare Part D, expanded discount eligibility for entities under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program, expansion of the range of existing manufacturer liabilities, expanded eligibility for Medicaid programs, additional reporting requirements, expansion of and enhanced penalties under fraud and abuse laws, and improved market access for follow-on biologic products. There have been legal and political challenges to PPACA. For example, the United States Supreme Court is currently reviewing the constitutionality of the PPACA. It is unclear how the Supreme Court ruling, other such litigation, and the healthcare reform efforts of the Biden administration will impact PPACA and our business. We expect that PPACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement, as well as additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product, including ZILRETTA. It is also possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to COVID-19.\nRisks Related to Product Development and Regulatory Compliance\nWe may be unable to remove the LOU or expand the label for ZILRETTA and may never obtain regulatory approval of ZILRETTA for additional indications, approval of our other product candidates in the United States, or obtain approval for or commercialize ZILRETTA or our other product candidates outside of the United States, which would limit our ability to realize their full market potential.\nThe time required to obtain approval by the FDA and comparable foreign authorities is unpredictable but typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. In addition, approval policies, regulations, or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate\u2019s clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions.\nOur product candidates could fail to receive regulatory approval for many reasons, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe applicable regulatory authorities may disagree with the design, scope, or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authorities that a product candidate is safe and effective for its proposed indication;\n\u2022\nthe results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required for approval;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to demonstrate that a product candidate\u2019s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;\n\u2022\nthe applicable regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates may not be sufficient to support the submission of an NDA or similar submission or to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere;\n\u2022\nthe applicable regulatory authorities may fail to approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical and commercial supplies; and\n\u2022\nthe approval policies or regulations of the applicable regulatory authorities may change significantly in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.\nThe lengthy approval process, as well as the unpredictability of future clinical trial results, may result in our failing to obtain regulatory approval to market ZILRETTA in additional indications or to market our other product candidates at all, which would harm our business, results of operations, and prospects.\nIn addition, any approval obtained may include fewer or more limited indications than we request, be contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials or require a label that does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for successful commercialization of that product candidate. For example, while ZILRETTA has been approved for the management of OA pain of the knee, the approved product label originally contained a limitation of use, or LOU, stating that ZILRETTA is not intended for repeat administration. On December 26, 2019, the FDA approved our supplemental new drug application, or sNDA, to revise the product label for ZILRETTA. The sNDA was based on data from an open-label Phase 3b clinical trial, which indicated that repeat administration of ZILRETTA for treatment of OA knee pain was safe and\nwell tolerated with no deleterious impact on cartilage or joint structure observed through X-ray analysis. While the LOU was updated from stating ZILRETTA was not intended for repeat administration to stating that the efficacy and safety of repeat administration of ZILRETTA have not been demonstrated, the FDA did not find the data submitted in the sNDA sufficient to approve a removal of the LOU entirely. If we are unable to remove the LOU or expand the label for ZILRETTA, our ability to fully market ZILRETTA may be limited. Any of the foregoing could harm the commercial prospects for our product candidates.\nOur product candidates may not receive regulatory approval despite success in clinical trials. Even if we successfully obtain regulatory approval to market one or more of our product candidates, our revenue will be dependent, to a significant extent, upon the size of the markets in the territories for which we gain regulatory approval. If the markets for patients or indications that we are targeting are not as significant as we estimate, we may not generate significant revenue from sales of such products, if approved.\nClinical development is a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results. Clinical failure can occur at any stage of clinical development.\nClinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. The results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials of our product candidates may not be predictive of the results of subsequent clinical trials. In particular, the results generated in our completed ZILRETTA pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial do not ensure that any future ZILRETTA clinical trial will be successful or consistent with the results generated in the Phase 3 trial.\nProduct candidates may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials. For example, while FX201 has demonstrated successful results in numerous animal models, we cannot predict if it will prove to behave similarly in our on-going Phase 1 trial or subsequent trials. In addition to the safety and efficacy trials of any product candidate, clinical trial failures may result from a multitude of factors including flaws in trial design, dose selection, placebo effect, and patient enrollment criteria. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials. In addition, data obtained from trials and studies are susceptible to varying interpretations, and regulators may not interpret our data as favorably as we do, which may delay, limit, or prevent regulatory approval. If any product candidate is found to be unsafe or lack efficacy or feasibility in particular indications, we will not be able to obtain regulatory approval for the indication and our business could be materially harmed.\nInterim, topline, and preliminary data from our preclinical studies and clinical trials may change as more data become available and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data.\nFrom time to time, we disclose interim, topline, or preliminary data from our preclinical studies and clinical trials, which is based on a preliminary analysis of then-available data, and the results and related findings and conclusions are subject to change as more data become available. We may also announce topline data following the completion of a preclinical study or clinical trial, which may be subject to change following a more comprehensive review of the data related to the particular study or trial. We also make assumptions, estimations, calculations, and conclusions as part of our analyses of data, and we may not have received or had the opportunity to fully and carefully evaluate all data. As a result, the interim, topline, or preliminary results that we report may differ from future results of the same studies, or different conclusions or considerations may qualify such results once additional data have been received and fully evaluated. Topline data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published. As a result, interim, topline, and preliminary data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available. Adverse differences between previous preliminary or interim data and future interim or final data could significantly harm our business prospects.\nInterim data from clinical trials that we may complete are also subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available, as higher doses or different dosing regimens are explored, or as patients from our clinical trials continue other treatments. Adverse differences between preliminary or interim data and final data could significantly harm our business prospects. Further, disclosure of interim data by us, our collaboration partners, or our competitors could result in volatility in the price of our common stock.\nIn addition, the information we choose to publicly disclose regarding a particular study or clinical trial is based on what is typically extensive information, and you or others may not agree with what we determine to be material or otherwise appropriate information to include in our disclosure, and any information we determine not to disclose may ultimately be deemed significant with respect to future decisions, conclusions, views, activities, or otherwise regarding a particular product candidate or our business. If the interim, topline, or preliminary data that we report differ from future or more comprehensive data, or if others, including regulatory authorities, disagree with the conclusions reached, our ability to obtain approval for and commercialize our product candidates, our business, operating results, prospects, or financial condition may be harmed.\nCOVID-19 will likely continue to have an adverse impact on our clinical trials and further development of our pipeline.\nCOVID-19\u2019s impact on the healthcare industry is significant and has impacted our on-going clinical trials and may disrupt further development of our pipeline. For example, in April 2020, we temporarily suspended the active Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating the safety and tolerability of FX201. The decision was made in consideration of guidance from the FDA to ensure the safety of trial participants and minimize risk to trial integrity from disruptions caused by COVID-19. In addition, we decided to terminate the Phase 2 trial evaluating the efficacy of ZILRETTA in patients with shoulder OA and adhesive capsulitis, given the small number of patients enrolled in the trial, the uncertainty as to when we would be able to restart the study, and the costs required to maintain it in an inactive status.\nAs COVID-19 continues to disrupt our ability to conduct clinical trials, we cannot predict with confidence when we will restart enrollment in or initiate new clinical trials for our clinical candidates in the United States and other countries. For example, while we subsequently restarted our Phase 1 clinical trial of FX201 in late May 2020, and we intend to initiate a trial investigating ZILRETTA in patients with shoulder OA and start clinical development of FX301 in 2021, we cannot guarantee that COVID-19\u2019s impact or restrictions implemented by government agencies or healthcare facilities in response to COVID-19 will not force us to delay, suspend, or terminate these trials, and we cannot predict how access to, utilization of, and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines may influence such impacts and restrictions. These impacts of COVID-19 will increase the costs of completing clinical development and delay our ability to obtain marketing approval for our pipeline product candidates and ZILRETTA for additional indications.\nDelays in clinical trials are common and have many causes, and any delay could result in increased costs to us and jeopardize or delay our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates.\nWe may experience delays in clinical trials of our products and product candidates. Our clinical trials may not begin on time, have an effective design, enroll a sufficient number of patients, or be completed on schedule, if at all. Our clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including:\n\u2022\ninability to raise funding necessary to initiate or continue a trial;\n\u2022\ndelays in obtaining regulatory approval to commence a trial;\n\u2022\ndelays in reaching agreement with the FDA on final trial design;\n\u2022\nimposition of a clinical hold for safety reasons or following an inspection of our clinical trial operations or trial sites by the applicable regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\ndelays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\ndelays in obtaining required institutional review board approval at each site;\n\u2022\ndelays in recruiting suitable patients to participate in a trial;\n\u2022\ndelays in having patients complete participation in a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u2022\nclinical sites dropping out of a trial to the detriment of enrollment;\n\u2022\ntime required to add new clinical sites;\n\u2022\ndelays by our contract manufacturers to produce and deliver sufficient supply of clinical trial materials; or\n\u2022\nthe impact of COVID-19 and actions taken to mitigate its spread, including access to, utilization of, and timing of COVID-19 vaccines.\nIf initiation or completion of our clinical trials are delayed for any reason, our development costs may increase, our approval process could be delayed, and our ability to commercialize our product candidates could be materially harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nChanges in funding for the FDA and other government agencies or their ability to maintain operations due to the impact of COVID-19 or other reasons could hinder their ability to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel, prevent new products from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner, or otherwise prevent those agencies from performing normal functions on which our business operations rely, which could negatively impact our business.\nThe ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels; ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept payment of user fees; the continuing impact of COVID-19; and statutory, regulatory, and policy changes. Average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of other government agencies on which our operations may rely, including those that fund research and development activities, is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. Disruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow their review and approval of new drugs, labeling supplements, and other regulatory requests to be acted upon, which would adversely affect our business.\nThe FDA granted marketing approval of ZILRETTA for the treatment of patients with OA pain of the knee, and we could face liability if a regulatory authority determines that we are promoting a product for any off-label uses.\nA company may not promote \u201coff-label\u201d uses for its drug products. An off-label use is the use of a product for an indication that is not described in the product\u2019s FDA-approved label in the United States or for uses in other jurisdictions that differ from those approved by the applicable regulatory agencies. Physicians, on the other hand, may prescribe products for off-label uses. Although the FDA and other regulatory agencies do not regulate a physician\u2019s choice of drug treatment made in the physician\u2019s independent medical judgment, they do restrict promotional communications from pharmaceutical companies or their employees with respect to off-label uses. A significant number of pharmaceutical companies have been the target of inquiries and investigations at the U.S. federal and state levels in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales practices, including pricing and Medicare of Medicaid reimbursement violations. A company that is found to have promoted off-label use of its product may be subject to significant liability, including substantial civil and criminal fines, damage awards, and other sanctions, such as consent decrees and corporate integrity agreements pursuant to which its activities would be subject to ongoing scrutiny and monitoring. Any regulatory enforcement action, qui tam suit by a private individual, or resulting fines, awards, or other sanctions would have an adverse effect on our revenue, business, financial prospects, and reputation.\nWe intend to comply with all promotional requirements, but we cannot be sure that regulatory agencies will agree that we have not violated those requirements. For example, we may communicate certain results from our clinical trials that are consistent with, but not directly included in, a product label. While we believe that our communication of these data is in accordance with FDA guidance and applicable laws, we cannot be certain that the FDA or other regulatory agencies will agree with our use of these data, and our sales force may use such data in a way that is inconsistent with our policies. As a result, we may be subject to significant liabilities, and our management\u2019s attention could be diverted to handle any such alleged violations.\nAny relationships with healthcare professionals, principal investigators, consultants, actual and potential customers, and third-party payers in connection with our current and future business activities are and will continue to be subject to federal and state healthcare laws. If we do not comply, or only partially comply, with such laws, we could face criminal sanctions, civil penalties, administrative penalties, imprisonment, exclusion, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements and oversight, and curtailment or restructuring of our operations.\nOur operations are directly or indirectly subject to various federal and state healthcare laws, such as fraud and abuse laws, anti-kickback laws, false claims laws, marketing expenditure tracking and disclosure (or \u201csunshine\u201d) laws, government price reporting, and health information privacy and security laws. Our costs associated with compliance and exposure to potential liability under these laws are likely to increase with increased commercialization. These laws may impact, among other things, our activities with investigators and research subjects, as well as sales, marketing, promotion, manufacturing, distribution, pricing, discounting, customer incentive programs, physician speaker programs, and other business arrangements and activities. We may also be subject to patient privacy regulation in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations may involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental and enforcement authorities will conclude that our business practices, including activities undertaken by third parties on our behalf, may not comply with statutes, regulations, or case law interpreting applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any applicable laws or regulations, we may be subject to significant penalties, including damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, possible exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements and oversight, and curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If a government authority were to conclude that we provided improper advice or encouraged the submission of a false claim for reimbursement, we could face governmental action against us. If any of the above occurs, it could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. Additionally, if any providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to significant sanctions, including exclusion from government-funded healthcare programs.\nZILRETTA is still subject to substantial ongoing regulatory requirements, and our product candidates may face future development and regulatory difficulties.\nThe FDA approved ZILRETTA only for the treatment of OA knee pain. If any additional clinical studies of ZILRETTA are negative, the FDA could decide to withdraw approval, add warnings, or narrow the approved indication in the product label.\nZILRETTA is, and, if approved, our other product candidates, will also be, subject to ongoing FDA requirements governing the labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, advertising, promotion, record-keeping, and reporting of\nsafety and other post-market information. The holder of an approved NDA is obligated to monitor and report adverse events, or AEs, and any failure of a product to meet the specifications in the NDA. The holder of an approved NDA must also submit new or supplemental applications and obtain FDA approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling, or manufacturing process. Advertising and promotional materials must comply with FDA rules and are subject to FDA review, in addition to other potentially applicable federal and state laws.\nIn addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to payment of user fees and continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, and adherence to commitments made in the NDA. If we or a regulatory agency discover previously unknown problems with a product, such as AEs of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions relative to that product or the manufacturing facility, including requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing.\nWe rely on third-party collaborators to assist us in meeting our reporting and related obligations. While we work closely with these third parties, we do not control all of their activities. If our third-party collaborators do not meet the relevant commitments, we may fail to meet our applicable regulatory requirements.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements for any product we may sell, a regulatory agency may take a variety of actions, including seeking an injunction, imposing penalties, withdrawing approval, or seizing the product. Any government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate negative publicity. The occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our products and generate revenue.\nIf we fail to develop, acquire, or in-license other potential future product candidates or products, our business and prospects will be limited.\nOur long-term growth strategy is to develop, acquire, or in-license and commercialize a portfolio of potential future product candidates. Our primary means of expanding our pipeline of product candidates is to select and acquire or in-license product candidates for the treatment of therapeutic indications that complement or augment our current pipeline, or that otherwise fit into our development or strategic plans on terms that are acceptable to us, or develop improved formulations and delivery methods for existing products. Developing new formulations or delivery methods of existing or potential future product candidates or identifying, selecting, and acquiring or in-licensing promising product candidates requires substantial technical, financial, and human resources expertise. Efforts to do so may not result in the actual development, acquisition, or in-license of a particular product candidate, potentially resulting in a diversion of our management\u2019s time and the expenditure of our resources with no resulting benefit. If we are unable to add additional product candidates to our pipeline, our long-term business and prospects will be limited.\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties\nWe rely completely on third parties to manufacture our commercial supplies of ZILRETTA and our preclinical and clinical drug supplies for our product candidates.\nIf we were to experience an unexpected loss of supply of any product or product candidate for any reason, we could experience disruptions in commercial supply or delays, suspensions, or terminations of clinical trials or regulatory submissions. We do not currently have nor do we plan to acquire the infrastructure or capability internally to manufacture our preclinical and clinical drug supplies, and we lack the resources and the capability to manufacture any of our product candidates on a clinical or commercial scale. The facilities used by our contract manufacturers or other third-party manufacturers to manufacture our products and product candidates must obtain and maintain approval by the FDA. While we work closely with our third-party manufacturers on the manufacturing process for our products and product candidates, including quality audits, we generally do not control the implementation of the manufacturing process of, and are completely dependent on, our contract manufacturers or other third-party manufacturers for compliance with cGMP regulatory requirements and for manufacture of both active drug substances and finished drug products. If our contract or other third-party manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to applicable specifications and the strict regulatory requirements in place, they will not be able to secure or maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities.\nIn addition, we have no control over the ability of our contract manufacturers or other third-party manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance, and qualified personnel. If an applicable regulatory authority does not approve, or withdraws approval for, these facilities for the manufacture of our products and product candidates, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to commercialize, develop, or obtain or maintain regulatory approval for our products and product candidates.\nWe are particularly reliant on Patheon with respect to maintaining ZILRETTA manufacturing capacity. Patheon facilities required approval from the FDA as a condition of regulatory approval for ZILRETTA, and. because Patheon manufactures ZILRETTA in the United Kingdom, or U.K., it needs to maintain and update its facility license with the applicable U.K. regulatory agencies, and any delay or inability to do so would delay or prevent Patheon from being able to produce commercial supplies of ZILRETTA. Furthermore, the manufacturing process for ZILRETTA is unique and involves specialized equipment and proprietary processes, which increases the risk that Patheon will experience manufacturing delays.\nWe also rely on our manufacturers to purchase from third-party suppliers the materials necessary to produce ZILRETTA and our product candidates. There are a limited number of suppliers for these materials, and we may need to assess alternate suppliers to prevent a possible disruption in production. We do not have any control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these raw materials. Moreover, we currently do not have any agreements for the commercial production of these raw materials. Although we generally do not begin a clinical trial unless we believe we have a sufficient supply of a product candidate to complete the clinical trial, any significant delay in the supply of a product candidate, or the raw material components thereof, for an ongoing clinical trial due to the need to replace a contract manufacturer or other third-party manufacturer could considerably delay completion of our clinical trials, product testing, and potential regulatory approval of our product candidates. If our manufacturers or we are unable to purchase these raw materials, there would be a shortage in supply, which would impair our ability to generate revenue from the sale of our products.\nWe expect to continue to depend on contract manufacturers or other third-party manufacturers for the foreseeable future. We have entered into long-term commercial supply agreements with our current contract manufacturers in order to maintain adequate supplies to manufacture finished ZILRETTA drug product. We may, however, be unable to enter into such agreements or do so on commercially reasonable terms for potential future product candidates, which could have a material adverse impact upon our business.\nWe rely on sole sources of supply for our products and product candidates, and any supply chain disruption may limit our product sales or cause delay in developing, obtaining approval for, and commercializing our product candidates.\nCurrently, we use the following sole sources of supply for manufacturing ZILRETTA: Farmabios SpA for TA, Evonik Corporation for PLGA, and Patheon for finished microsphere drug product. Because of the unique equipment and process for loading TA onto PLGA microspheres, transferring finished drug product manufacturing activities for ZILRETTA to an alternate supplier would be a time-consuming and costly endeavor, and there are only a limited number of manufacturers that we believe are capable of performing this function for us. Switching finished drug suppliers may involve substantial cost and could result in a failure to maintain adequate product supplies. We expect that for the foreseeable future Patheon will be the only manufacturer qualified as a commercial supplier of ZILRETTA with the FDA. From time to time, commercial batches of ZILRETTA may fail to meet required specifications and be unavailable for commercial sale. If we experience multiple successive batch failures, or if supply from Patheon is otherwise interrupted, there could be a significant disruption in commercial supply. Any alternative vendor would need to be qualified through an NDA supplement, which could result in further delay. Applicable regulatory agencies may also require additional studies if a new ZILRETTA supplier is relied upon for commercial production.\nAs the global impact of COVID-19 continues, we may experience additional disruptions that could severely impact our supply chain, which would disrupt our clinical trials and commercialization efforts. To the extent that our vendors are unable to comply with their obligations under our agreements with them or cannot deliver or are delayed in delivering goods and services to us, our ability to continue meeting commercial demand for our products or advancing development of our product candidates may become impaired. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain sufficient commercial supply if there is a rapid increase in ZILRETTA demand as the impact of COVID-19 abates.\nThese factors could cause the disruption of the commercialization of ZILRETTA; delay clinical trials, regulatory submissions, required approvals, or commercialization of any of our other product or product candidates; cause us to incur higher costs; or prevent us from commercializing them successfully. Furthermore, if our suppliers fail to deliver the required clinical or commercial quantities of active pharmaceutical ingredient on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices and we are unable to secure one or more replacement suppliers capable of production at a substantially equivalent cost, our clinical trials may be delayed or we could lose potential revenue in the event of a product stockout for ZILRETTA or any of our other product candidates that is approved and launched.\nOur other product candidates also rely on sole sources of supply for the preclinical and clinical supply of materials. The manufacturing processes for our product candidates are complex, and it may be difficult or impossible to finalize appropriate processes for the scaled manufacture of the product candidates.\nManufacturing issues may arise that could increase product and regulatory approval costs or disrupt or delay commercialization.\nAs we scale up manufacturing of ZILRETTA and other product candidates, we may encounter product, packaging, equipment, and process-related issues that may require refinement or resolution in order to proceed with our planned clinical trials or maintain regulatory approval for commercial marketing. In the future, we may identify impurities or other product related issues, which could result in increased scrutiny by regulatory authorities, suspensions of commercial activities or product recalls, delays in our clinical program and regulatory approval, increases in our operating expenses, or failure to obtain or maintain approval for our products or product candidates.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates and our business could be substantially harmed.\nWe rely upon and plan to continue to rely upon third-party CROs to monitor and manage data for our preclinical and clinical programs. We rely on these parties for execution of our preclinical studies and clinical trials and control only certain aspects of their activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our trials is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory, and scientific standards, and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We and our CROs are required to comply with FDA laws and regulations regarding current good clinical practice, or GCP, which are also required by comparable foreign regulatory authorities for all of our products in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce GCP through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators, and trial sites. If we or any of our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCP, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the applicable regulatory authority may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot be certain that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with GCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under cGMP regulations. While we have agreements governing activities of our CROs, we have limited influence over their actual performance. In addition, portions of the clinical trials for our product candidates may be conducted outside of the United States, which will make it more difficult for us to monitor CROs and perform visits of our clinical trial sites and will force us to rely heavily on CROs to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials and compliance with applicable regulations.\nSome of our CROs have an ability to terminate their respective agreements with us for patient safety reasons or concerns regarding our financial stability. If any of our relationships with these third-party CROs terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or to do so on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, our CROs are not our employees, and, except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such CROs, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our preclinical and clinical programs. If CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols, regulatory requirements, or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed, or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates. Consequently, our results of operations and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase substantially, and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed significantly.\nSwitching or adding CROs involves additional cost and requires management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO commences work. As a result, delays occur, which can materially impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines. Though we carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and prospects.\nWe may not be successful in establishing effective collaborations or maintaining development and commercialization collaborations, and our partners may not devote sufficient resources to the development or commercialization of our products or product candidates or may otherwise fail in development or commercialization efforts, which could adversely affect our ability to develop or commercialize certain of our products or product candidates and our financial condition and operating results.\nWe may seek third-party collaborators or licensees for the development and commercialization of our product candidates. For instance, we have entered into an exclusive license agreement for the development and commercialization of ZILRETTA in China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan with HK Tainuo and Jiangsu Tainuo. We intend to seek to enter into additional collaborations for developing, marketing and commercializing our product candidates in certain territories at the appropriate time in the future. We have, with respect to our collaboration with HK Tainuo and Jiangsu Tainuo, and will likely have, with respect to any additional collaboration arrangements with any third parties, limited control over the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators dedicate to the development or commercialization of our product candidates. Our ability to\ngenerate revenues from these arrangements will depend on our collaborators' abilities to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements and otherwise to comply with their contractual obligations.\nAny of our existing or future collaborations may not ultimately be successful, which could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects. In addition, the terms of any such collaboration or other arrangement may not prove to be favorable to us or may not be perceived as favorable, which may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock. In some cases, we may be responsible for continuing development of a product or product candidate or research program under collaboration and the payment we receive from our partner may be insufficient to cover the cost of this development. Moreover, collaborations and sales and marketing arrangements are complex and time consuming to negotiate, document and implement and they may require substantial resources to maintain.\nConflicts may arise between us and partners, such as conflicts concerning the interpretation of clinical data, the achievement of milestones, the division of development or commercialization responsibilities or expenses, the interpretation of financial provisions, or the ownership of intellectual property developed during the collaboration. If any such conflicts arise, a partner could act in its own self-interest, which may be adverse to our best interests. Any such disagreement between us and a partner could delay or prevent the development or commercialization of our products or product candidates, and in turn prevent us from generating sufficient revenue to achieve or maintain profitability:\nFurther, we are subject to the following additional risks associated with our current and any future collaborations with third parties, the occurrence of which could cause our collaboration arrangements to fail:\n\u2022\ncollaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of our product candidates or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in the collaborator's strategic focus or available funding or external factors such as an acquisition that diverts resources or creates competing priorities;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may fail in their development or commercialization efforts with our product candidate, in which event the development and commercialization of such product candidate could be delayed or terminated;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may delay clinical trials, insufficiently fund a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial, abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials, or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\u2022\ncollaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our products or product candidates if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may fail to successfully design or implement clinical trials and may collect and publish clinical trial data that are inconsistent with, or contradictory to, our clinical trial results;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n\u2022\ncollaborators may deviate from established guidelines, instructions, or best practices for product handling and storage, which may compromise the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of our products and potentially result in the occurrence of serious adverse events in patients using our products;\n\u2022\ncollaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates;\n\u2022\nreductions in the payments we believe are due to us pursuant to the applicable collaboration arrangement;\n\u2022\nactions taken by a partner inside or outside our collaboration that could negatively impact our rights or benefits under our collaboration; or\n\u2022\npartner unwillingness to keep us informed regarding the progress of its development and commercialization activities or to permit public disclosure of the results of those activities.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations and Industry\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain key executives and to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on the members of our executive team, the loss of whose services could adversely impact the achievement of our objectives. While we have entered into employment agreements or offer letters with each of our executive officers, any of them could leave our employment at any time, as all of our employees are \u201cat will\u201d employees. Recruiting and retaining other qualified employees for our business, including scientific and technical personnel, will also be critical to our success. There is currently a shortage of skilled executives and other technically qualified personnel in our industry,\nparticularly in the greater Boston, Massachusetts, area where our headquarters is located, which is likely to continue. As a result, competition for skilled personnel is intense, and the turnover rate can be high. We may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies for individuals with similar skill sets. In addition, failure in the commercialization of ZILRETTA or clinical studies of our product candidates may make it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified personnel. The inability to recruit or the loss of the services of any executive or key employee might impede the progress of our development and commercialization objectives.\nWe face potential product liability, and, if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability.\nThe use of our product candidates in clinical trials and the sale of our products expose us to the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims might be brought against us by consumers, healthcare providers, or others coming into contact with our products or product candidates. If we cannot successfully defend against product liability claims, we could incur substantial liability and costs. In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\nimpairment of our business reputation and perception of our products in the market;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal or suspension of marketing approvals;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022\ncosts due to related litigation;\n\u2022\ndistraction of management\u2019s attention from our primary business;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants;\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize our product candidates;\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for our products approved for commercial sale; and\n\u2022\nreputational harm.\nOur current product liability insurance coverage may not be sufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive, and in the future we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability. On occasion, large judgments have been awarded in class action or mass tort lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated adverse effects. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to decline and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could adversely affect our results of operations and business.\nCollaborations with third parties to develop and commercialize products outside of the United States subject us to a variety of risks associated with international operations that could materially and adversely affect our business.\nAgreements with third parties to market ZILRETTA, and, if approved, our product candidates, outside of the United States, subject us to additional risks related to entering into international business relationships, including:\n\u2022\ndifferent regulatory requirements for drug approvals in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers, and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\neconomic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u2022\ncompliance with tax, employment, immigration, and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u2022\nforeign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue;\n\u2022\nworkforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\n\u2022\ndifferent government payer systems, multiple payer-reimbursement regimes or patient self-pay systems, and price controls;\n\u2022\npotential noncompliance with the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, or similar antibribery and anticorruption laws in other jurisdictions as well as various regulations pertaining to data privacy, such as the GDPR;\n\u2022\nproduction shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and\n\u2022\nbusiness interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable U.S. and foreign privacy and data protection laws and regulations, we may be subject to liabilities that adversely affect our business, operations, and financial performance.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations requiring that we take measures to protect the privacy and security of certain information we gather and use in our business. For example, HIPAA, as amended, and its implementing regulations impose certain regulatory and contractual requirements regarding the privacy and security of personal health information on covered entities, such as health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and certain healthcare providers and their business associates and covered subcontractors that perform certain services involving the use or disclosure of personal health information. In addition, numerous other federal and state laws, such as state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use, and storage of personal information.\nWe may also be subject to or affected by foreign laws and regulation governing the collection, use, disclosure, security, transfer, and storage of personal data, such as information that we collect about employees, patients, and healthcare providers in connection with clinical trials and our other operations. The global legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and implementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. This evolution may create uncertainty in our business, result in liability, or impose additional costs on us. The cost of compliance with these laws, regulations, and standards is high and is likely to increase in the future. It is possible that each of these privacy laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with laws, regulations, or standards could result in negative publicity, diversion of management time and effort, and proceedings against us by governmental entities or others. In many jurisdictions, enforcement actions and consequences for noncompliance are rising. As we continue to expand into other foreign countries and jurisdictions, we may be subject to additional laws and regulations that may affect how we conduct business.\nBusiness interruptions could delay us in the process of developing or commercializing our products and product candidates.\nWe are vulnerable to natural disasters and other events that could disrupt our operations. We do not carry insurance for natural disasters and may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur. Further, our operations, and those of our contractors, consultants, and collaborators, could be subject to various natural or man-made disasters or business interruptions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations. To the extent our suppliers and service providers are unable to comply with their obligations under our agreements with them or cannot deliver or are delayed in delivering goods and services to us, our ability to continue meeting commercial demand for our products or advancing development of our product candidates may become impaired.\nExposure to U.K. political developments could impact our suppliers and harm our business.\nThe U.K.\u2019s referendum to leave the EU, or \u201cBrexit,\u201d has caused and may continue to cause disruptions to capital and currency markets worldwide. The full impact of the Brexit decision, however, remains to be seen. Our results of operations and access to capital may be negatively affected by interest rate, exchange rate, and other market and economic volatility, as well as regulatory and political changes. The tax consequences of the U.K.\u2019s withdrawal from the EU are uncertain as well. Brexit may also have a detrimental effect on our suppliers, which could, in turn, adversely affect our revenues and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain or protect intellectual property rights, we may not be able to compete effectively in our market.\nWe rely upon a combination of patents, trade secret protection, confidentiality agreements, and proprietary know how and intend to seek marketing exclusivity for any approved product in order to protect the intellectual property related to our products and product candidates. To date we have three issued patents covering ZILRETTA in the United States.\nThe strength of patents in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical field involves complex legal and scientific questions and can be uncertain. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability, and commercial value of our patent rights and our current or future licensors\u2019 or collaborators\u2019 patent rights are highly uncertain. The patent applications that we own or in-license may fail to result in issued patents with claims that cover our products or product candidates in applicable countries. Even for our issued and future patents, third parties may challenge their inventorship, ownership, validity, enforceability, or scope in the courts or issuing patent offices. This may result in such patents being narrowed or invalidated, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technologies or products or limit the duration of the patent protection for our technologies and products. If this were to occur, early generic competition could be expected against the covered product and potentially reduce the value of our product candidates in development. Also, a third party may challenge our rights to patents and patent applications that we license from third parties. Furthermore, even if they are\nunchallenged, our patents and patent applications may not adequately protect our intellectual property or prevent others from designing around our claims.\nIf our patent applications with respect to any product or product candidate fail to issue or if their breadth or strength of protection is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us in development and threaten our ability to commercialize any resulting products. We cannot offer any assurances about which, if any, patents will issue or whether any issued patents will not be found invalid and unenforceable or will go unthreatened by third parties. Further, if we encounter delays in regulatory approvals for additional indications or in additional jurisdictions, the period of time during which we could market ZILRETTA or any product candidate under patent protection could be reduced. See \u201cBusiness-Patents and Patent Applications\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our material patents and patent applications.\nIn addition to the protection afforded by patents, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary know-how that is not patentable, processes for which patents are difficult to enforce, and any other elements of our drug development process that involve proprietary know-how, information, or technology that is not covered by patents. For example, we maintain trade secrets with respect to certain of the formulation and manufacturing techniques related to the TA-formulated PLGA microspheres in ZILRETTA, including those that relate to precise pharmaceutical release. Although we generally require all of our employees to assign their inventions to us, and all of our employees and third parties who have access to our proprietary know-how, information, or technology to enter into confidentiality agreements, we cannot provide any assurances that all such agreements have been duly executed or that our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. Further, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same manner as the laws of the United States. As a result, we may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property both in the United States and abroad. If we are unable to prevent material disclosure of the non-patented intellectual property related to our technologies to third parties, and there is no guarantee that we will have any such enforceable trade secret protection, we may not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThird-party claims of infringement may prevent or delay our development and commercialization efforts.\nOur commercial success depends in part on our avoiding infringement of the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. There is a substantial amount of litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including patent infringement lawsuits, interferences, oppositions, and inter party reexamination proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or U.S. PTO. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications owned by third parties exist in the fields in which we and our collaborators are commercializing or developing product candidates. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our products and product candidates may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent rights of third parties.\nThird parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. There may be third-party patents or patent applications with claims to materials, formulations, methods of manufacture, or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our products or product candidates. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending patent applications that may later result in issued patents that our products or product candidates may infringe. In addition, third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of our technologies infringes upon these patents. If any third-party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover the manufacturing process of any of our products or product candidates, any drug substance formed during the manufacturing process, or any final product itself, the holders of such patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize such product or product candidate unless we obtain a license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire. Similarly, if any third-party patent were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our formulations or methods of use, the holders of any such patent may be able to block our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable product or product candidate unless we obtain a license or until such patent expires. In either case, such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nParties making claims against us may request injunctive or other equitable relief, which relief could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize one or more of our products or product candidates. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees for willful infringement, obtain one or more licenses from third parties, pay royalties, or redesign our infringing products or manufacturing processes, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. We cannot predict whether any such license would be available at all or whether\nit would be available on commercially reasonable terms. Furthermore, even in the absence of litigation, we may need to obtain licenses from third parties to advance our research, manufacture clinical trial supplies, or allow commercialization of our product candidates. We may fail to obtain any of these licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at all, and would then be unable to further develop and commercialize one or more of our products or product candidates, which could harm our business significantly. We cannot provide any assurances that third-party patents do not exist that might be enforced against our products, resulting in either an injunction prohibiting our sales, or, with respect to our sales, an obligation on our part to pay royalties or other forms of compensation to third parties.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive, time consuming, and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our issued patents, licensed patents, or our other intellectual property. In some cases, it may be difficult or impossible to detect third-party infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, even in relation to issued patent claims, and proving any such infringement may be even more difficult. Accordingly, for such undetectable infringement or misappropriation our ability to recover damages will be negligible, and we could be at a market disadvantage because we may lack the resources of some of our competitors to monitor for and detect infringement. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. Any claims we assert against perceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their patents. In addition, in any patent infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part; construe the patent\u2019s claims narrowly; or refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology. An adverse result in litigation proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patent. In addition, patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment, and other provisions during the patent application process. While an inadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which non-compliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. If we fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering our product candidates, our competitors might be able to enter the market, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting, and defending patents on all of our product candidates throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as United States law. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing on our intellectual property rights in all countries outside the United States, and competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection and may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection but enforcement is not as strong as in the United States.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business.\nOur owned or licensed patents directed to our product candidates may expire or have limited commercial life before the product candidate is approved for marketing in a relevant jurisdiction.\nGiven the amount of time required for the development, testing, and regulatory review of product candidates, patents protecting our product candidates might expire before or shortly after those candidates obtain regulatory approval, which may subject us to increased competition and reduce or eliminate our ability to recover our development costs. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours. Although we may be able to seek extensions of patent terms where available, we cannot be certain that an extension will be granted, or, if granted, what the applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded during any extended period will be. The applicable authorities in each country may not agree with our assessment of\nwhether such extensions are available and may refuse to grant extensions to our patents or grant more limited extensions than we request. If this occurs, our competitors may take advantage of our investment in development and trials by referencing our clinical and preclinical data and launch their product earlier than might otherwise be the case.\nChanges in U.S. patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products.\nOur success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biotechnology industry involve both technological and legal complexity and is therefore costly, time-consuming, and inherently uncertain. In addition, in recent years the United States enacted patent reform legislation and U.S. Supreme Court rulings narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty regarding our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the U.S. PTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future.\nWe have in-licensed or acquired a portion of our intellectual property necessary to develop our product candidates, and, if we fail to comply with our obligations under any of these arrangements, we could lose such intellectual property rights.\nWe rely on several arrangements with third parties that give us rights to intellectual property necessary for the manufacture of ZILRETTA and the development of FX201 and FX301. Our current arrangements impose various development, royalty, and other obligations on us. If we materially breach these obligations, or if our counterparts fail to adequately perform their respective obligations, these exclusive arrangements could be terminated, which would result in our inability to develop, manufacture, and sell products that are covered by such intellectual property.\nWe may need to obtain licenses from third parties to advance our research or allow commercialization of our product candidates, and we have done so from time to time. We may fail to obtain any of these licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at all. If so, we may be required to expend significant time and resources to develop or license replacement technology. If we are unable to do so, we may be unable to develop or commercialize our affected product candidates, which could harm our business significantly. We cannot provide any assurances that third-party patents do not exist that might be enforced against our current product candidates or future products, resulting in either an injunction prohibiting our sales, or, with respect to our sales, an obligation on our part to pay royalties or other forms of compensation to such third parties.\nIn many cases, patent prosecution of our licensed technology is controlled solely by the licensor. If our licensors fail to obtain and maintain patent or other protection for the proprietary intellectual property we license from them, we could lose our rights to the intellectual property or our exclusivity with respect to those rights, and our competitors could market competing products using the intellectual property. In certain cases, we control the prosecution and maintenance of patents resulting from licensed technology. If we breach any of those obligations, we may incur significant liability to our licensing partners. Licensing of intellectual property is of critical importance to our business and involves complex legal, business, and scientific issues and is complicated by the rapid pace of scientific discovery in our industry. Disputes may arise regarding intellectual property subject to a licensing agreement, including:\n\u2022\nthe scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which our technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor not covered by the licensing agreement;\n\u2022\nthe sublicensing of patent and other rights under our collaborative development relationships;\n\u2022\nour diligence obligations under the license agreement and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations;\n\u2022\nthe ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by our licensors and us and our partners; and\n\u2022\nthe priority of invention of patented technology.\nIf disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidates.\nIf our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our business may be adversely affected.\nWe rely on our trademarks and trade names to build name recognition among potential partners and potential customers in our markets of interest. If we are unable to successfully register our trademarks and trade names and establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, then we may not be able to compete effectively, and our business may be adversely affected. Our efforts to enforce or protect our proprietary rights related to trademarks or trade names may be ineffective and could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations. In addition, our unregistered trademarks or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented, or declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks. We may not be able to protect our rights to these trademarks and trade names. Competitors may adopt trade names or trademarks similar to ours, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to market confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other registered trademarks or trademarks that incorporate variations of our unregistered trademarks or trade names. If our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our business may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may be highly volatile, you may not be able to resell your shares at a desired market price, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile due to a variety of factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nsuccess or perceived success of the commercialization of ZILRETTA;\n\u2022\nthe impact and duration of COVID-19 and actions taken to mitigate its spread;\n\u2022\ninability to obtain approval for additional indications for ZILRETTA;\n\u2022\nfailure to successfully develop and commercialize additional product candidates;\n\u2022\nchanges in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u2022\nadverse results or delays in clinical trials;\n\u2022\ninability to obtain additional funding;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations applicable to our products or product candidates;\n\u2022\ninability to obtain adequate supply for our products or product candidates, or the inability to do so at acceptable prices;\n\u2022\nadverse regulatory decisions;\n\u2022\nintroduction of new products or technologies by our competitors;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet or exceed product development or financial projections we provide to the public;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet or exceed the estimates and projections of the investment community;\n\u2022\nthe perception of the pharmaceutical industry by the public, legislatures, regulators, and the investment community;\n\u2022\nannouncements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\ndisputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters, and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key scientific or management personnel;\n\u2022\nsignificant lawsuits, including patent, product liability, or stockholder litigation;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by us or our stockholders in the future; and\n\u2022\ntrading volume of our common stock.\nThe trading price of our common stock may also be dependent upon the valuations and recommendations of the analysts who cover our company. If our results do not meet these analysts\u2019 forecasts, the expectations of our investors, or any financial guidance or expectations we provide to investors, the market price of our common stock could decline. Our ability to meet analysts\u2019 forecasts (including revenue and profitability), investors\u2019 expectations, and our own guidance or financial expectations is substantially dependent on our ability to increase sales of ZILRETTA and to successfully commercialize ZILRETTA in the United States. Because we have not yet fully commercialized ZILRETTA, we and the analysts who cover\nour company have limited ability to accurately predict future sales results, and actual results may differ materially from expectations.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the Nasdaq Global Market in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, and we have in the past experienced volatility that has been unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance. Broad market and industry factors may continue to negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.\nWe will continue to incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses and devote a substantial amount of time in complying with a variety of laws, regulations, and rules, such as the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act; and the rules of the Nasdaq Global Market. We also incur costs indirectly resulting from those laws, regulations, and rules. For example, they have made it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to incur substantial costs to maintain our current levels of such coverage. In addition, stockholder activism and the current political environment may lead to new regulations and disclosure obligations involving additional costs and further impacting how we operate our business.\nIf the estimates we make, or the assumptions on which we rely, in preparing our consolidated financial statements prove inaccurate, our actual results may vary from those reflected in our projections and accruals.\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses; the amounts of charges accrued by us; and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, our management evaluates our critical and other significant estimates and judgments, including, among others, those associated with revenue recognition and accrued expenses related to preclinical and clinical development costs. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events, contractual milestones, and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Any significant differences between our actual results and our estimates could materially affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nStockholder sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities. We cannot predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive plans, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.\nWe may need significant additional capital in the future to continue our planned operations. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell such equity securities in one or more transactions at prices, under terms, and in a manner as we may determine from time to time. These sales may result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights superior to our existing stockholders.\nPursuant to our 2013 equity incentive plan, we are authorized to grant stock options and other equity-based awards to our employees, directors, and consultants. The number of shares available for future grant under this plan automatically increases each year by 4% of all shares of our capital stock outstanding as of December 31 of the prior calendar year, subject to the ability of our board of directors to reduce the size of any such increase. Currently, we plan to register the increased number of shares available for issuance under this plan each year. If our board of directors elects to increase the number of shares available for future grant by a significant amount each year, our stockholders would experience additional dilution, which could cause our stock price to fall.\nWe are at risk of securities class action litigation.\nSecurities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities, and pharmaceutical companies have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years. If we face such\nlitigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could harm our business.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nOur net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future tax liabilities because of their limited duration or because of restrictions under U.S. tax law, which only permits NOLs generated in tax years ending on or before December 31, 2017, to be carried forward for twenty years. Our federal NOLs generated in tax years ending after December 31, 2017, may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of federal NOLs, particularly for tax years beginning after December 31, 2020, may be limited. It is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the Tax Act and the CARES Act.\nSection 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, contains rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an ownership change to utilize its NOLs and tax credits existing as of the date of such ownership change. Under the rules, such an ownership change is generally any change in ownership of more than 50% of a company\u2019s stock within a rolling three-year period. The rules generally focus on changes in ownership among stockholders considered by the rules as owning, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of the stock of a company or in connection with new issuances of stock by the company. Future ownership changes may further limit the amount of NOL carryforwards we could use to offset future taxable income.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock, so any returns will be limited to the value of our stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common stock. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation, and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Additionally, our loan agreements with certain banks contain covenants that restrict our ability to pay dividends. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to the appreciation of their stock.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated bylaws, and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders, and may prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nSome provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nauthorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nlimiting the removal of directors by the stockholders;\n\u2022\ncreating a staggered board of directors;\n\u2022\nrequiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\neliminating the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders; and\n\u2022\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove members of management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing such members. In addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless such transactions are approved by our board of directors. This provision could delay or prevent a change of control, even if desired by or beneficial to our stockholders. Further, other provisions of Delaware law may also discourage, delay, or prevent someone from acquiring us or merging with us.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption, or security lapse of that technology, including any cybersecurity incidents, could harm our ability to operate our business effectively.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems and those of third parties with which we contract are vulnerable to cyber-attacks, computer viruses, unauthorized access, physical damage, and telecommunication and\nelectrical failures. System failures, accidents, or security breaches could cause interruptions in our operations and could result in a material disruption of our commercial and clinical activities and business operations, in addition to possibly requiring substantial expenditures of resources to remedy. The loss of clinical trial data could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability, our development programs or the development of our product candidates could be delayed, and trade secrets or other competitive advantages could be lost.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants, or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties.\nWe employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies and may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants, or independent contractors have used or disclosed confidential information of third parties. We may also be subject to claims that former employers or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patents. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. There is no guarantee of success in defending these claims, and, even if we are successful, litigation could result in substantial cost and be a distraction to our management and other employees.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, which could cause stockholders to lose confidence in our public reporting and harm our business and the trading price of our common stock.\nEffective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, any testing by us conducted in connection with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in such internal controls that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that require prospective or retroactive changes to our controls, procedures, or consolidated financial statements, which could result in substantial additional costs. Inadequate internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 14457, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "FLXN"}
