{"cik": "1578318", "company": "Envision Healthcare Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-29", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the factors described below, in addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report, when evaluating the Company and its business. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business operations. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe are subject to decreases in our revenue and profit margin under our fee-for-service contracts, where we bear the risk of changes in volume, payor mix and third-party reimbursement rates.\nIn our fee-for-service arrangements, which generated approximately 78% of our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, we, or our affiliated physicians, collect the fees for transports and physician services provided. Under these arrangements, we assume financial risks related to changes in the mix of insured and uninsured patients and patients covered by government-sponsored healthcare programs, third-party reimbursement rates, and transports and patient volume. In some cases, our revenue decreases if our volume or reimbursement decreases, but our expenses may not decrease proportionately. See \u201c-Risks Related to Healthcare Regulation-Changes in the rates or methods of third-party reimbursements, including due to political discord in the budgeting process outside our control, may adversely affect our revenue and operations\u201d.\nWe collect a smaller portion of our fees for services rendered to uninsured patients than for services rendered to insured patients. Our credit risk related to services provided to uninsured individuals is exacerbated because the law requires communities to provide \u201c911\u201d emergency response services and hospital EDs to treat all patients presenting to the ED seeking care for an emergency medical condition regardless of their ability to pay. We also believe uninsured patients are more likely to seek care at hospital EDs because they frequently do not have a primary care physician with whom to consult.\nOur revenue would be adversely affected if we lose existing contracts.\nA significant portion of our growth historically has resulted from increases in the number of patient encounters and fees for services we provide under existing contracts, the addition of new contracts and the increase in the number of emergency and non-emergency transports. Substantially all of our net revenue in the year ended December 31, 2015, was generated under contracts, including exclusive contracts that accounted for approximately 88% of our 2015 net revenue. Our contracts with hospitals generally have terms of three years and the term of our contracts with communities to provide \u201c911\u201d services generally ranges from three to five years. Most of our contracts are terminable by either of the parties upon notice of as little as 30 days. Any of our contracts may not be renewed or, if renewed, may contain terms that are not as favorable to us as our current contracts. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in retaining our existing contracts or that any loss of contracts would not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, certain of our contracts will expire during each fiscal period, and we may be required to seek renewal of these contracts through a formal bidding process that often requires written responses to a RFP. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in retaining such contracts or that we will retain them on terms that are as favorable as present terms.\nWe may not accurately assess the costs we will incur under new contracts.\nOur new contracts increasingly involve a competitive bidding process. When we obtain new contracts, we must accurately assess the costs we will incur in providing services in order to realize adequate profit margins and otherwise meet our financial and strategic objectives. Increasing pressures from healthcare payors to restrict or reduce reimbursement rates at a time when the costs of providing medical services continue to increase make assessing the costs\nassociated with the pricing of new contracts, as well as maintenance of existing contracts, more difficult. Starting new contracts in a number of our service lines may also negatively impact cash flow as we absorb various expenses before we are able to bill and collect revenue associated with the new contracts. In addition, integrating new contracts, particularly those in new geographic locations, could prove more costly, and could require more management time, than we anticipate. Our failure to accurately predict costs or to negotiate an adequate profit margin could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to successfully recruit and retain physicians and other healthcare professionals with the qualifications and attributes desired by us and our customers.\nOur ability to recruit and retain affiliated physicians and other healthcare professionals significantly affects our performance under our contracts. Our customer hospitals have increasingly demanded a greater degree of specialized skills, training and experience in the healthcare professionals providing services under their contracts with us. This decreases the number of healthcare professionals who may be permitted to staff our contracts. Moreover, because of the scope of the geographic and demographic diversity of the hospitals and other facilities with which we contract, we must recruit healthcare professionals, and particularly physicians, to staff a broad spectrum of contracts. We have had difficulty in the past recruiting physicians to staff contracts in some regions of the country and at some less economically advantaged hospitals. Moreover, we compete with other entities to recruit and retain qualified physicians and other healthcare professionals to deliver clinical services. Our future success in retaining and winning new hospital contracts depends in part on our ability to recruit and retain physicians and other healthcare professionals to maintain and expand our operations.\nOur non-compete agreements and other restrictive covenants involving physicians may not be enforceable.\nWe have contracts with physicians and professional corporations in many states. Some of these contracts, as well as our contracts with hospitals, include provisions preventing these physicians and professional corporations from competing with us both during and after the term of our relationship with them. The law governing non-compete agreements and other forms of restrictive covenants varies from state to state. Some states are reluctant to strictly enforce non-compete agreements and restrictive covenants applicable to physicians. There can be no assurance that our non-compete agreements related to affiliated physicians and professional corporations will not be successfully challenged as unenforceable in certain states. In such event, we would be unable to prevent former affiliated physicians and professional corporations from competing with us, potentially resulting in the loss of some of our hospital contracts.\nIf we fail to implement our business strategy, our financial performance and our growth could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur future financial performance and success are dependent in large part upon our ability to implement our business strategy successfully. Our business strategy includes several initiatives, including capitalizing on organic growth opportunities, growing complementary and integrated services lines, pursuing selective acquisitions, enhancing operational efficiencies and productivity, and expanding our Evolution Health business. We may not be able to implement our business strategy successfully or achieve the anticipated benefits of our business plan. If we are unable to do so, our long-term growth, profitability, and ability to service our debt will be adversely affected. Even if we are able to implement some or all of the initiatives of our business plan successfully, our operating results may not improve to the extent we anticipate, or at all.\nImplementation of our business strategy could also be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, such as increased competition, legal developments, government regulation, general economic conditions or increased operating costs or expenses. In addition, to the extent we have misjudged the nature and extent of industry trends or our competition, we may have difficulty in achieving our strategic objectives.\nOur margins may be negatively impacted by cross-selling to existing customers or selling bundled services to new customers.\nOne of our growth strategies involves the continuation and expansion of our efforts to sell complementary services across our businesses. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in our cross-selling efforts. As part of our cross-selling efforts, we may need to offer a bundled package of services that are at a lower price point to existing or new customers as compared to the price of individual services or otherwise offer services which may put downward price pressure on our services. Such price pressure may have a negative impact on our operating margins. In addition, if a complementary service offered as part of a bundled package underperforms as compared to the other services included in such package, we could face reputational harm which could negatively impact our relationships with our customers and ultimately our results of operations.\nWe may not succeed in our continuing efforts to develop our Evolution Health business, which is subject to additional rules, prohibitions, regulations and reimbursement requirements that differ from our facility-based physician and healthcare transportation services.\nWe have continued to expand our physician-led services outside the hospital through our Evolution Health business. Currently, Evolution Health accounts for less than 5% of our consolidated net revenue and provides services in only four states. A key component of our growth strategy is to continue to expand our Evolution Health business by adding new customers and entering new geographic markets. As part of this strategy, we are expanding the physician-led services we provide through Evolution Health to health plans, hospital systems, and at-risk provider groups. The continuing expansion of our Evolution Health business will expose us to additional risks, in part because our Evolution Health business requires compliance with additional federal and state laws and regulations, including those that govern licensure, enrollment, documentation, prescribing, coding, and scope of practice, which may differ from the laws and regulations that govern our other businesses. For example, we utilize nurses and other allied health personnel in providing care to patients outside the acute-care setting. It is necessary for us to make sure that these personnel only provide services within the scope of their license. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations may result in unanticipated expenses. In addition, if we are unable to comply with the additional legal requirements, we could incur liability which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe implementation of the PPACA is not complete, and is subject to various uncertainties that could affect our Evolution Health business, including (i) the degree to which the United States moves away from its traditional \"fee-for-service\" delivery model to an outcome-based delivery model, (ii) the number of additional healthcare consumers currently without means of payment that will ultimately gain access to insurance and (iii) the scope of reimbursement changes to the U.S. healthcare system. As such, there can be no assurance that our expansion efforts in this business will ultimately be successful. In addition, realizing growth opportunities in physician-led care management solutions outside the hospital setting will require significant attention from our management team, and if management is unable to provide such attention, implementation of this strategy could be delayed or hindered and thereby negatively impact our business.\nWe may enter into partnerships with payors and other healthcare providers, including risk-based partnerships. If this strategy is not successful, our financial performance could be adversely affected.\nIn recent years, we have entered into strategic business partnerships with hospital systems and other large payors to take advantage of commercial opportunities in our facility-based physician services business. For example, EmCare has entered into joint venture agreements with large hospital systems to provide physician services to various healthcare facilities. However, there can be no assurance that our efforts in these areas will continue to be successful. Moreover, joint venture and strategic partnership models expose us to commercial risks that may be different from our other business models, including that the success of the joint venture or partnership is only partially under our operational and legal control and the opportunity cost of not pursuing the specific venture independently or with other partners. In addition, under certain joint venture or strategic partnership arrangements, the hospital system partner has the option to acquire our stake in the venture on a predetermined financial formula, which, if exercised, would lead to the loss of our associated revenue and profits which may not be offset fully by the immediate proceeds of the sale of our stake. Furthermore, joint ventures may raise fraud and abuse issues. For example, the OIG has taken the position that certain contractual joint ventures between a party which makes referrals and a party which receives referrals for a\nspecific type of service may violate the federal Anti-Kickback Statute if one purpose of the arrangement is to encourage referrals.\nIn addition, we have entered into and in the future expect to enter into risk-based partnerships designed to encourage healthcare providers to assume financial accountability for outcomes and work together to better coordinate care for patients, both when they are in the hospital and after they are discharged. Examples of such opportunities include CMS initiatives such as the CMS Bundled Payments for Care Improvement initiative, in which participation commenced in 2015, the Medicare Shared Savings Program and the Independence at Home Demonstration, as well as agreements entered into by our Evolution Health business with health plans that include risk-based incentives tied to outcomes. We view taking advantage of targeted risk-based initiatives, including opportunities afforded by the PPACA, as an important part of our business strategy in order to develop our integrated service offerings across the patient continuum, continue the expansion of our Evolution Health business, further develop our relationships with hospitals, hospital systems and other payors, and prepare for the possibility that Medicare may require us to participate in a capitated or value-based payment system for certain of our businesses in the future.\nAdvancing such initiatives can be time consuming and expensive, and there can be no assurance that our efforts in these areas will ultimately be successful. In addition, if we fail to deliver quality care under these risk-based partnerships at a cost consistent with our expectations, or are unable to adequately assess and manage the risks we are assuming, our participation in these initiatives may be less profitable than previously expected, or we may be subject to significant financial penalties depending on the program. An unsuccessful implementation of such initiatives could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe could be subject to lawsuits for which we are not fully reserved.\nPhysicians, hospitals and other participants in the healthcare industry have become subject to an increasing number of lawsuits alleging medical malpractice and related legal theories such as negligent hiring, supervision and credentialing. Similarly, ambulance transport services may result in lawsuits concerning vehicle collisions and personal injuries, patient care incidents or mistreatment and employee job-related injuries. Some of these lawsuits may involve large claim amounts and substantial defense costs.\nEmCare generally procures professional liability insurance coverage for its affiliated medical professionals and professional and corporate entities. Beginning January 1, 2002, insurance coverage has been provided by affiliates of CCC, which then reinsure the entire program, procured primarily by EmCare\u2019s wholly owned insurance subsidiary, EMCA. AMR currently has an insurance program which includes a combination of insurance purchased from third parties and large self-insured retentions and/or deductibles for all of its insurance programs subsequent to September 1, 2001. AMR reinsures a portion of these self-insured retentions and/or deductibles through an arrangement with EMCA. Under these insurance programs, we establish reserves, using actuarial estimates, for all losses covered under the policies. Moreover, in the normal course of our business, we are involved in lawsuits, claims, audits and investigations, including those arising out of our billing and marketing practices, employment disputes, contractual claims and other business disputes for which we may have no insurance coverage, and which are not subject to actuarial estimates. The outcome of these matters could have a material effect on our results of operations in the period when we identify the matter, and the ultimate outcome could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur liability to pay for EmCare\u2019s and certain of AMR\u2019s insurance program losses is partially collateralized by funds held through EMCA and letters of credit issued by Corporation and, to the extent these losses exceed the collateral and assets of EMCA or the limits of our insurance policies, will have to be funded by us. If our AMR losses with respect to such claims exceed the collateral held by AMR\u2019s insurance providers or the collateral held through EMCA, and the letters of credit issued by Corporation in connection with our self-insurance program or the limits of our insurance policies, we will have to fund such amounts.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulatory regimes, including a variety of labor laws and regulations. Failure to comply with laws and regulations could subject us to, among other things, penalties and legal expenses which could have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations including, but not limited to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\u201cERISA\u201d) and regulations promulgated by the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d), the U.S. Department of Labor and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. We are also subject to a variety of federal and state employment and labor laws and regulations, including the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act, the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, and other regulations related to working conditions, wage-hour pay, overtime pay, family leave, employee benefits, antidiscrimination, termination of employment, safety standards and other workplace regulations.\nFailure to properly adhere to these and other applicable laws and regulations could result in investigations, the imposition of penalties or adverse legal judgments by public or private plaintiffs, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Similarly, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the cost of complying with newly-implemented laws and regulations.\nIn addition, from time to time we have received, and expect to continue to receive, correspondence from former employees terminated by us who threaten to bring claims against us alleging that we have violated one or more labor and employment regulations. In certain instances former employees have brought claims against us and we expect that we will encounter similar actions against us in the future. An adverse outcome in any such litigation could require us to pay contractual damages, compensatory damages, punitive damages, attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.\nSee \u201c-Risks Related to Healthcare Regulation\u201d.\nThe reserves we establish with respect to our losses covered under our insurance programs are subject to inherent uncertainties.\nIn connection with our insurance programs, we establish reserves for losses and related expenses, which represent estimates involving actuarial and statistical projections, at a given point in time, of our expectations of the ultimate resolution and administration costs of losses we have incurred in respect of our liability risks. Insurance reserves inherently are subject to uncertainty. Our reserves are based on historical claims, demographic factors, industry trends, severity and exposure factors and other actuarial assumptions calculated by an independent actuary firm. The independent actuary firm performs studies of projected ultimate losses on an annual basis and provides quarterly updates to those projections. We use these actuarial estimates to determine appropriate reserves. Our reserves could be significantly affected if current and future occurrences differ from historical claim trends and expectations. While we monitor claims closely when we estimate reserves, the complexity of the claims and the wide range of potential outcomes may hamper timely adjustments to the assumptions we use in these estimates. Actual losses and related expenses may deviate, individually and in the aggregate, from the reserve estimates reflected in our consolidated financial statements. The long-term portion of insurance reserves was $252.7 million and $180.6 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. If we determine that our estimated reserves are inadequate, we will be required to increase reserves at the time of the determination, which would result in a reduction in our net income in the period in which the deficiency is determined.\nInsurance coverage for some of our losses may be inadequate and may be subject to the credit risk of commercial insurance companies.\nSome of our insurance coverage is through various third-party insurers. To the extent we hold policies to cover certain groups of claims or rely on insurance coverage obtained by third parties to cover such claims, but either we or such third parties did not obtain sufficient insurance limits, did not buy an extended reporting period policy, where applicable, or the issuing insurance company is unable or unwilling to pay such claims, we may be responsible for those losses. Furthermore, for our losses that are insured or reinsured through commercial insurance companies, we are subject\nto the \u201ccredit risk\u201d of those insurance companies. While we believe our commercial insurance company providers currently are creditworthy, there can be no assurance that such insurance companies will remain so in the future.\nVolatility in market conditions could negatively impact insurance collateral balances and result in additional funding requirements.\nOur insurance collateral is comprised principally of government and investment grade securities and cash deposits with third parties. The volatility experienced in the market has not had a material impact on our financial position or performance. Future volatility could, however, negatively impact the insurance collateral balances and result in additional funding requirements.\nWe have made and may continue to make acquisitions, such as the recently completed acquisition of Rural/ Metro, which could divert the attention of management and which may not be integrated successfully into our existing business.\nWe have pursued, and may continue to pursue, acquisitions to increase our market penetration, enter new geographic markets and expand the scope of services we provide. In 2015, we acquired nine companies for total consideration of approximately $1.4 billion, including our acquisition of Rural/ Metro. We have evaluated, and expect to continue to evaluate, possible acquisitions on an ongoing basis. We cannot assure you that we will identify suitable acquisition candidates, acquisitions will be completed on acceptable terms or at all, our due diligence process will uncover all potential liabilities or issues affecting our integration process, we will not incur break-up, termination or similar fees and expenses, or we will be able to integrate successfully the operations of any acquired business, such as Rural/ Metro, into our existing business. Furthermore, acquisitions in new geographic markets and services may require us to comply with new and unfamiliar legal and regulatory requirements, which could impose substantial obligations on us and our management, cause us to expend additional time and resources, and increase our exposure to penalties or fines for non-compliance with such requirements. The acquisitions could be of significant size and involve operations in multiple jurisdictions. The acquisition and integration of another business could divert management attention from other business activities. This diversion, together with other difficulties we may incur in integrating an acquired business, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may incur debt to finance acquisitions. Such borrowings may not be available on terms as favorable to us as our current borrowing terms and may increase our leverage.\nThe high level of competition in our segments of the market for medical services could adversely affect our contract and revenue base.\nEmCare. The market for providing physician staffing and related management services to hospitals and clinics is highly competitive. Such competition could adversely affect our ability to obtain new contracts, retain existing contracts and increase or maintain profit margins. We compete with both national and regional enterprises such as Team Health, Hospital Physician Partners, The Schumacher Group, California Emergency Physicians, and National Emergency Services Healthcare Group, some of which may have greater financial and other resources available to them, greater access to physicians or greater access to potential customers. We also compete against local physician groups and self-operated facility-based physician services departments for satisfying staffing and scheduling needs.\nAMR. The market for providing ambulance transport services to municipalities, counties, other healthcare providers and third-party payors is highly competitive. In providing ambulance transport services, we compete with governmental entities, including cities and fire districts, hospitals, local and volunteer private providers, and with several large national and regional providers such as, Falck, Paramedics Plus and Acadian Ambulance. In many communities, our most important competitors are the local fire departments, which in many cases have acted traditionally as the first response providers during emergencies, and have been able to expand their scope of services to include emergency ambulance transport and do not wish to give up their franchises to a private competitor. In 2011, the California state legislature passed legislation which makes some public agencies eligible for additional federal funding for Medi-Cal ambulance transports if certain conditions are met. These additional funds may provide an opportunity for certain public agencies, including local fire departments, to enter into the ambulance transportation market or provide additional\nambulance transports, which could increase competition in the California market. As of December 31, 2015, we are unaware of any public agencies receiving funds from this program.\nWe are required to make capital expenditures, particularly for our healthcare transportation business, in order to remain compliant and competitive.\nOur capital expenditure requirements primarily relate to maintaining and upgrading our vehicle fleet and medical equipment to serve our customers and remain competitive. The aging of our vehicle fleet requires us to make regular capital expenditures to maintain our current level of service. Our net capital expenditures from purchases and sales of assets totaled $94.4 million, $75.6 million, and $65.0 million in the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In addition, changing competitive conditions or the emergence of any significant advances in medical technology could require us to invest significant capital in additional equipment or capacity in order to remain competitive. If we are unable to fund any such investment or otherwise fail to invest in new vehicles or medical equipment, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe depend on our senior management and may not be able to retain those employees or recruit additional qualified personnel.\nWe depend on our senior management. The loss of services of any of the members of our senior management could adversely affect our business until a suitable replacement can be found. There may be a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions, and we cannot assure you that we would be able to identify or employ such qualified personnel on acceptable terms.\nOur business depends on numerous complex information systems, and any failure to successfully maintain these systems or implement new systems could materially harm our operations.\nWe depend on complex, integrated information systems and standardized procedures for operational and financial information and our billing operations. We may not have the necessary resources to enhance existing information systems or implement new systems where necessary to handle our volume and changing needs. Furthermore, we may experience unanticipated delays, complications and expenses in implementing, integrating and operating our systems. Any interruptions in operations during periods of implementation would adversely affect our ability to properly allocate resources and process billing information in a timely manner, which could result in customer dissatisfaction and delayed cash flow. We also use the development and implementation of sophisticated and specialized technology to differentiate our services from our competitors and improve our profitability. The failure to successfully implement and maintain operational, financial and billing information systems could have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain new business, retain existing business and maintain or increase our profit margins.\nDisruptions in our disaster recovery systems, management continuity planning or information systems could limit our ability to operate our business effectively, or adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur information technology systems facilitate our ability to conduct our business. While we have disaster recovery systems and business continuity plans in place, any disruptions in our disaster recovery systems or the failure of these systems to operate as expected could, depending on the magnitude of the problem, adversely affect our operating results by limiting our capacity to effectively monitor and control our operations. Despite our implementation of a variety of security measures, our technology systems could be subject to physical or electronic break-ins, and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering. In addition, in the event that a significant number of our management personnel were unavailable in the event of a disaster, our ability to effectively conduct business could be adversely affected.\nInformation security risks have generally increased in recent years because of new technologies and the increased incidence of cyber-attacks resulting in the theft of protected health, business or financial information. Outside parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce our employees or to release confidential or sensitive information or to make fraudulent payments, through illegal electronic tactics. A failure in or breach of our information systems as a result of cyber-attacks or other tactics could disrupt our business, result in the release or misuse of confidential or proprietary\ninformation or financial loss, damage our reputation, increase our administrative expenses, and expose us to additional risk of liability to federal or state governments or individuals. Although we believe that we have robust information security procedures and other safeguards in place, which are monitored and routinely tested internally and by external parties, as cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. Any of these disruptions or breaches of security could have a material adverse effect on our business, regulatory compliance, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights that are material to our business, or to defend successfully against intellectual property infringement claims by third parties.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends in part upon our intellectual property rights, including but not limited to our trademarks and copyrights, and our proprietary technology. Our use of contractual provisions, confidentiality procedures and agreements, and trademark, copyright, unfair competition, trade secret and other laws to protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary technology may not be adequate. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary technology, or to defend against claims by third parties that the conduct of our businesses or our use of intellectual property infringes upon such third-party\u2019s intellectual property rights. Any intellectual property litigation or claims brought against us, whether or not meritorious, could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources, and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained in all cases. The terms of any settlement or judgment may require us to pay substantial amounts to the other party or cease exercising our rights in such intellectual property, including ceasing the use of certain trademarks used by us to distinguish our services from those of others or ceasing the exercise of our rights in copyrightable works. In addition, we may have to seek a license to continue practices found to be in violation of a third-party\u2019s rights, which may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected as a result.\nA successful challenge by tax authorities to our treatment of certain physicians as independent contractors or the elimination of an existing safe harbor could materially increase our costs relating to these physicians.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we contracted with approximately 7,100 physicians and clinical personnel as independent contractors to fulfill our contractual obligations to customers. Because we treat these physicians as independent contractors rather than as employees, we do not (i) withhold federal or state income or other employment related taxes from the compensation that we pay to them, (ii) make federal or state unemployment tax or Federal Insurance Contributions Act payments with respect to them, (iii) provide workers compensation insurance with respect to them (except in states that require us to do so for independent contractors), or (iv) allow them to participate in benefits and retirement programs available to employed physicians. Our contracts with these physicians obligate them to pay these taxes and other costs. Whether these physicians are properly classified as independent contractors generally depends upon the facts and circumstances of our relationship with them. It is possible that the nature of our relationship with these physicians would support a challenge to our treatment of them as independent contractors. Under current federal tax law, however, if our treatment of these physicians is consistent with a long-standing practice of a significant segment of our industry and we meet certain other requirements, it is possible, but not certain, that our treatment would qualify under a \u201csafe harbor\u201d and, consequently, we would be protected from the imposition of taxes. However, if a challenge to our treatment of these physicians as independent contractors by federal or state taxing authorities were successful and these physicians were treated as employees instead of independent contractors, we could be liable for taxes, penalties and interest to the extent that these physicians did not fulfill their contractual obligations to pay those taxes. In addition, there are currently, and have been in the past, proposals made to eliminate the safe harbor, and similar proposals could be made in the future. If such a challenge were successful or if the safe harbor were eliminated, there could be a material increase in our costs relating to these physicians and, therefore, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMany of our AMR employees are represented by labor unions and any work stoppage could adversely affect our business.\nApproximately 45% of AMR employees are represented by 70 active collective bargaining agreements. There are 29 operational locations representing approximately 4,160 employees currently in the process of negotiations or will be subject to negotiation in 2016. In addition, 18 collective bargaining agreements, representing approximately 2,540 employees will be subject to negotiations in 2017. We cannot assure you that we will be able to negotiate a satisfactory renewal of these collective bargaining agreements or that our employee relations will remain stable.\nOur consolidated revenue and earnings could vary significantly from period to period due to our national contract with the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\nOur revenue and earnings under our national contract with FEMA are likely to vary significantly from period to period. In the past five years of the FEMA contract, our annual revenues from services rendered under this contract have varied by approximately $44 million. In its present form, the contract generates significant revenue for us only in the event of a national emergency and then only if FEMA exercises its broad discretion to order a deployment. Our FEMA revenue therefore depends largely on circumstances outside of our control. We therefore cannot predict the revenue and earnings, if any, we may generate in any given period from our FEMA contract. This may lead to increased volatility in our actual revenue and earnings period to period.\nWe may be required to enter into large scale deployment of resources in response to a national emergency under our contract with FEMA, which may divert management attention and resources.\nWe do not believe that a FEMA deployment adversely affects our ability to service our local \u201c911\u201d contracts. However, any significant FEMA deployment requires significant management attention and could reduce our ability to pursue other local transport opportunities, such as inter-facility transports, and to pursue new business opportunities, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Healthcare Regulation\nWe conduct business in a heavily regulated industry and if we fail to comply with these laws and government regulations, we could incur penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations.\nThe healthcare industry is heavily regulated and closely scrutinized by federal, state and local governments. Comprehensive statutes and regulations govern the manner in which we provide and bill for services, our contractual relationships with our physicians, vendors and customers, our marketing activities and other aspects of our operations. Failure to comply with these laws can result in civil and criminal penalties such as fines, damages, overpayment recoupment loss of enrollment status and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The risk of our being found in violation of these laws and regulations is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are sometimes open to a variety of interpretations. Any action against us for violation of these laws or regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could take a long period of time to resolve, cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business.\nOur practitioners and our customers are also subject to ethical guidelines and operating standards of professional and trade associations and private accreditation agencies. Compliance with these guidelines and standards is often required by our contracts with our customers or to maintain our reputation.\nThe laws, regulations and standards governing the provision of healthcare services may change significantly in the future. We cannot assure you that any new or changed healthcare laws, regulations or standards will not materially adversely affect our business. We cannot assure you that a review of our business by judicial, law enforcement, regulatory or accreditation authorities will not result in a determination that could adversely affect our operations.\nWe are subject to comprehensive and complex laws and rules that govern the manner in which we bill and are paid for our services by third-party payors, and the failure to comply with these rules, or allegations that we have failed to do so, can result in civil or criminal sanctions, including exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs.\nLike most healthcare providers, the majority of our services are paid for by private and governmental third-party payors, such as Medicare and Medicaid. These third-party payors typically have differing and complex billing and documentation requirements that we must meet in order to receive payment for our services. Reimbursement to us is typically conditioned on our providing the correct procedure and diagnostic codes and properly documenting the services themselves, including the level of service provided, the medical necessity for the services, the site of service and the identity of the practitioner who provided the service.\nWe must also comply with numerous other laws applicable to our documentation and the claims we submit for payment, including but not limited to (i) \u201ccoordination of benefits\u201d rules that dictate which payor we must bill first when a patient has potential coverage from multiple payors, (ii) requirements that we obtain the signature of the patient or patient representative, or, in certain cases, alternative documentation, prior to submitting a claim, (iii) requirements that we make repayment within a specified period of time to any payor which pays us more than the amount to which we are entitled, (iv) requirements that we bill a hospital or nursing home, rather than Medicare, for certain ambulance transports provided to Medicare patients of such facilities, (v) \u201creassignment\u201d rules governing our ability to bill and collect professional fees on behalf of our physicians, (vi) requirements that our electronic claims for payment be submitted using certain standardized transaction codes and formats and (vii) laws requiring us to handle all health and financial information of our patients in a manner that complies with specified security and privacy standards. See \u201cBusiness-Regulatory Matters-Medicare, Medicaid and Other Government Reimbursement Programs\u201d.\nGovernmental and private third-party payors and other enforcement agencies carefully audit and monitor our compliance with these and other applicable rules, and in some cases in the past have found that we were not in compliance. We have received in the past, and expect to receive in the future, repayment demands from third-party payors based on allegations that our services were not medically necessary, were billed at an improper level, or otherwise violated applicable billing requirements. Our failure to comply with the billing and other rules applicable to us could result in non-payment for services rendered or refunds of amounts previously paid for such services. In addition, non-compliance with these rules may cause us to incur civil and criminal penalties, including fines, imprisonment and exclusion from government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, under a number of state and federal laws. These laws include the federal False Claims Act, the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, HIPAA, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and other provisions of federal, state and local law. The federal False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute were both recently amended in a manner which makes it easier for the government to demonstrate that a violation has occurred.\nA number of states have enacted false claims acts that are similar to the federal False Claims Act. Additional states are expected to enact such legislation in the future because Section 6031 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (\u201cDRA\u201d) amended the federal law to encourage these types of changes, along with a corresponding increase in state initiated false claims enforcement efforts. Under the DRA, if a state enacts a false claims act that is at least as stringent as the federal statute and that also meets certain other requirements, such state will be eligible to receive a greater share of any monetary recovery obtained pursuant to certain actions brought under such state\u2019s false claims act. The OIG, in consultation with the Attorney General of the United States, is responsible for determining if a state\u2019s false claims act complies with the statutory requirements. Currently, at least 29 states and the District of Columbia have some form of false claims act. The OIG has reviewed 28 of these and determined that 15 of these satisfy the DRA standards. We anticipate this figure will continue to increase.\nIn addition, from time to time we self-identify practices that may have resulted in Medicare or Medicaid overpayments or other regulatory issues. For example, we have previously identified situations in which we may have inadvertently utilized incorrect billing codes for some of the services we have billed to government programs such as Medicare or Medicaid. In such cases, if appropriate, it is our practice to disclose the issue to the affected government programs and to refund any resulting overpayments. Although the government usually accepts such disclosures and repayments without taking further enforcement action, it is possible that such disclosures or repayments will result in\nallegations by the government that we have violated the False Claims Act or other laws, leading to investigations and possibly civil or criminal enforcement actions.\nOn January 16, 2009, the HHS released the final rule mandating that everyone covered by the Administrative Simplification Provisions of HIPAA, which includes EmCare and AMR, must implement ICD-10 for medical coding. Pursuant to the HIPAA Administrative Data Standards and Related Requirements all claims submitted on or after October 1, 2015, were required to comply with ICD-10 guidelines. ICD-10 codes contain significantly more information than the ICD-9 codes currently used for medical coding and will require covered entities to code with much greater detail and specificity than ICD-9 codes. We have and may continue to incur additional costs for computer system updates, training, and other resources required to implement these changes.\nOther changes to the Medicare program intended to implement Medicare\u2019s new \u201cpay for performance\u201d philosophy may require us to make investments to receive maximum Medicare reimbursement for our services. These program revisions may include (but are not necessarily limited to) the Medicare Physician Quality Reporting System (the \u201cPQRS\u201d), formerly known as the Medicare Physician Quality Reporting Initiative, which provides additional Medicare compensation to physicians who implement and report certain quality measures.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of these or any of the other laws which govern our activities, any resulting penalties, damages, fines or other sanctions could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.\nUnder recently enacted amendments to federal privacy law, we are subject to more stringent penalties in the event we improperly use or disclose protected health information regarding our patients.\nHIPAA required HHS to adopt standards to protect the privacy and security of certain health-related information. The HIPAA privacy regulations contain detailed requirements concerning the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information by \u201ccovered entities\u201d, which include EmCare and AMR.\nIn addition to the privacy requirements, HIPAA covered entities must implement certain administrative, physical, and technical security standards to protect the integrity, confidentiality and availability of certain electronic health information received, maintained, or transmitted by covered entities or their business associates. HIPAA also implemented the use of standard transaction code sets and standard identifiers that covered entities must use when submitting or receiving certain electronic healthcare transactions, including activities associated with the billing and collection of healthcare claims.\nHITECH, as implemented by an omnibus final rule published in the Federal Register on January 25, 2013, significantly expands the scope of the privacy and security requirements under HIPAA and increases penalties for violations. Under HITECH mandatory penalties are imposed for certain violations of HIPAA that are due to \u201cwillful neglect\u201d. Penalties range from $100 per violation and can exceed $50,000 for a single violation and up to $250,000 for repeated violations, subject to a cap of $1.5 million for violations of the same standard in a single calendar year. HITECH also authorized state attorneys general to file suit on behalf of their residents. Courts can award damages, costs and attorneys\u2019 fees related to violations of HIPAA. In addition, HITECH mandates that the Secretary of HHS conduct periodic compliance audits of a cross-section of HIPAA covered entities or business associates. It also tasks HHS with establishing a methodology whereby harmed individuals who were the victims of breaches of unsecured PHI may receive a percentage of the Civil Monetary Penalty fine paid by the violator.\nHITECH and implementing regulations enacted by HHS further require that patients be notified of any unauthorized acquisition, access, use, or disclosure of their unsecured PHI that compromises the privacy or security of such information, with some exceptions related to unintentional or inadvertent use or disclosure by employees or authorized individuals within the \u201csame facility\u201d. HITECH and implementing regulations specify that such notifications must be made \u201cwithout unreasonable delay and in no case later than 60 calendar days after discovery of the breach\u201d. If a breach affects 500 patients or more, it must be reported immediately to HHS, which will post the name of the breaching entity on its public web site. Breaches affecting 500 patients or more in the same state or jurisdiction must also be reported to the local media. If a breach involves fewer than 500 people, the covered entity must record it in a log and\nnotify HHS at least annually. These security breach notification requirements apply not only to unauthorized disclosures of unsecured PHI to outside third parties, but also to unauthorized internal access to such PHI. This means that unauthorized employee \u201csnooping\u201d into medical records could trigger the notification requirements.\nMany states in which we operate also have state laws that protect the privacy and security of confidential, personal information. These laws may be similar to or even more protective than the federal provisions. Not only may some of these state laws impose fines and penalties upon violators, but some may afford private rights of action to individuals who believe their personal information has been misused. California\u2019s patient privacy laws, for example, provide for penalties of up to $250,000 and permit injured parties to sue for damages.\nThe impact of recent healthcare reform legislation and other changes in the healthcare industry and in healthcare spending on us is currently unknown, but may adversely affect our business model, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur revenue is from the healthcare industry and could be affected by changes in healthcare spending and policy. The healthcare industry is subject to changing political, regulatory and other influences. In March 2010, the President signed into law the PPACA, commonly referred to as \u201cthe healthcare reform legislation\u201d, which made major changes in how healthcare is delivered and reimbursed, and increased access to health insurance benefits to the uninsured and underinsured population of the United States. The PPACA, among other things, increases the number of individuals with Medicaid and private insurance coverage, implements reimbursement policies that tie payment to quality, facilitates the creation of accountable care organizations that may use capitation and other alternative payment methodologies, strengthens enforcement of fraud and abuse laws, and encourages the use of information technology. Many of these changes did not go into effect until 2014, and many require implementing regulations which have not yet been drafted or have been released only as proposed rules.\nIn addition, certain provisions of the PPACA authorize voluntary demonstration projects, which include the development of bundling payments for acute, inpatient hospital services, physician services, and post-acute services for episodes of hospital care. The impact of these projects on us cannot be determined at this time.\nFurthermore, the PPACA may adversely affect payors by increasing their medical cost trends, which could have an effect on the industry and potentially impact our business and revenues as payors seek to offset these increases by reducing costs in other areas, although the extent of this impact is currently unknown.\nFollowing challenges to the constitutionality of certain provisions of the PPACA by a number of states, on June 28, 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the individual mandate provisions of the PPACA, but struck down the provisions that would have allowed HHS to penalize states that do not implement Medicaid expansion provisions through the loss of existing federal Medicaid funding. At least 29 states and the District of Columbia have implemented or are planning to implement the Medicaid expansion. It is uncertain whether the remaining states will implement the expansion at a later date, or whether any participating states will discontinue the expansion. While the PPACA will increase the likelihood that more people in the United States will have access to health insurance benefits, we cannot quantify or predict with any certainty the likely impact of the PPACA on our business model, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we are unable to timely enroll our providers in the Medicare program, our collections and revenue will be harmed.\nThe 2009 Physician Fee Schedule rule substantially reduced the time within which providers can retrospectively bill Medicare for services provided by such providers from 27 months prior to the effective date of the enrollment to 30 days prior to the effective date of the enrollment. In addition, the new enrollment rules also provide that the effective date of the enrollment will be the later of the date on which the enrollment application was filed and approved by the Medicare contractor, or the date on which the provider began providing services. If we are unable to properly enroll physicians and midlevel providers within the 30 days after the provider begins providing services, we will be precluded from billing Medicare for any services which were provided to a Medicare beneficiary more than 30 days prior to the effective date of the enrollment. Such failure to timely enroll providers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, the PPACA added additional enrollment requirements for Medicare and Medicaid enrollment. Those statutory requirements have been further enhanced through implementing regulations and increased enforcement scrutiny. Every enrolled provider must revalidate its enrollment at regular intervals, and must update the Medicare contractors and many state Medicaid programs with significant changes on a timely (and typically very short) basis. If we fail to provide sufficient documentation as required to maintain our enrollment, Medicare could deny continued future enrollment or revoke our enrollment and billing privileges.\nIf current or future laws or regulations force us to restructure our arrangements with physicians, professional corporations and hospitals, we may incur additional costs, lose contracts and suffer a reduction in net revenue under existing contracts, and we may need to refinance our debt or obtain debt holder consent.\nA number of laws bear on our relationships with our physicians. There is a risk that state authorities in some jurisdictions may find that our contractual relationships with our physicians violate laws prohibiting the corporate practice of medicine and fee-splitting. These laws generally prohibit the practice of medicine by lay entities or persons and are intended to prevent unlicensed persons or entities from interfering with or inappropriately influencing the physician\u2019s professional judgment. They may also prevent the sharing of professional services income with non-professional or business interests. From time to time, including recently, we have been involved in litigation in which private litigants have raised these issues.\nOur physician contracts include contracts with individual physicians and with physicians organized as separate legal professional entities (e.g., professional medical corporations). Antitrust laws may deem each such physician/entity to be separate, both from EmCare and from each other and, accordingly, each such physician/practice is subject to a wide range of laws that prohibit anti-competitive conduct between or among separate legal entities or individuals. A review or action by regulatory authorities or the courts could force us to terminate or modify our contractual relationships with physicians and affiliated medical groups or revise them in a manner that could be materially adverse to our business.\nVarious licensing and certification laws, regulations and standards apply to us, our affiliated physicians and our relationships with our affiliated physicians. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in our services being found to be non-reimbursable or prior payments being subject to recoupment, and can give rise to civil or criminal penalties. We routinely take the steps we believe are necessary to retain or obtain all requisite licensure and operating authorities. While we have made reasonable efforts to substantially comply with federal, state and local licensing and certification laws and regulations and standards as we interpret them, we cannot assure you that agencies that administer these programs will not find that we have failed to comply in some material respects.\nEmCare\u2019s professional liability insurance program, under which insurance is provided for most of our affiliated medical professionals and professional and corporate entities, is reinsured through our wholly owned subsidiary, EMCA. The activities associated with the business of insurance, and the companies involved in such activities, are closely regulated. Failure to comply with the laws and regulations can result in civil and criminal fines and penalties and loss of licensure. While we have made reasonable efforts to substantially comply with these laws and regulations, and utilize licensed insurance professionals where necessary or appropriate, we cannot assure you that we will not be found to have violated these laws and regulations in some material respects.\nAdverse judicial or administrative interpretations could result in a finding that we are not in compliance with one or more of these laws and rules that affect our relationships with our physicians.\nThese laws and rules, and their interpretations, may also change in the future. Any adverse interpretations or changes could force us to restructure our relationships with physicians, professional corporations or our hospital customers, or to restructure our operations. This could cause our operating costs to increase significantly. A restructuring could also result in a loss of contracts or a reduction in revenue under existing contracts. Moreover, if we are required to modify our structure and organization to comply with these laws and rules, our financing agreements may prohibit such modifications and require us to obtain the consent of the holders of such debt or require the refinancing of such debt.\nOur relationships with healthcare providers and facilities and our marketing practices are subject to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and similar state laws, and we entered into a settlement in 2006 for alleged violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute.\nWe are subject to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of \u201cremuneration\u201d in return for, or to induce, the referral of business or ordering of\nservices paid for by Medicare or other federal programs. \u201cRemuneration\u201d has been broadly interpreted to mean anything of value, including, for example, gifts, discounts, credit arrangements, and in-kind goods or services, as well as cash. Certain federal courts have held that the Anti-Kickback Statute can be violated if \u201cone purpose\u201d of a payment is to induce referrals. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. Violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute can result in imprisonment, civil or criminal fines or exclusion from Medicare and other governmental programs. Recognizing that the federal Anti-Kickback Statute is broad, Congress authorized the OIG to issue a series of regulations, known as \u201csafe harbors\u201d. These safe harbors set forth requirements that, if met in their entirety, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal, or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy each applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities, such as the OIG.\nIn 1999, the OIG issued an Advisory Opinion indicating that discounts provided to health facilities on the transports for which they are financially responsible potentially violate the Anti-Kickback Statute when the ambulance company also receives referrals of Medicare and other government-funded transports from the facility. The OIG has clarified that not all discounts violate the Anti-Kickback Statute, but that the statute may be violated if part of the purpose of the discount is to induce the referral of the transports paid for by Medicare or other federal programs, and the discount does not meet certain \u201csafe harbor\u201d conditions. In the Advisory Opinion and subsequent pronouncements, the OIG has provided guidance to ambulance companies to help them avoid unlawful discounts.\nLike other ambulance companies, we have provided discounts to our healthcare facility customers (nursing homes and hospitals) in certain circumstances. We have attempted to comply with applicable law when such discounts are provided. However, the government alleged that certain of our hospital and nursing home contracts in effect in Texas prior to 2002 contained discounts in violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, and in 2006 we entered into a settlement with the government regarding these allegations. The settlement included a CIA. The term of that CIA has expired, we have filed a final report with the OIG and this CIA was released in February 2012.\nThere can be no assurance that other investigations or legal action related to our contracting practices will not be pursued against AMR in other jurisdictions or for different time frames. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Some of these state prohibitions apply to referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any payor, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and do not contain identical safe harbors. Additionally, we could be subject to private actions brought pursuant to the False Claims Act\u2019s \u201cwhistleblower\u201d or \u201cqui tam\u201d provisions which, among other things, allege that our practices or relationships violate the Anti-Kickback Statute. The False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. In recent years, the number of suits brought by private individuals has increased dramatically. In addition, various states have enacted false claim laws analogous to the False Claims Act. Many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payor and not merely a federal healthcare program. There are many potential bases for liability under these false claim statutes. Liability arises, primarily, when an entity knowingly submits, or causes another to submit, a false claim for reimbursement. Pursuant to changes in the PPACA, a claim resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute can constitute a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act. Further, the PPACA amended the Anti-Kickback Statute in a manner which makes it easier for the government to demonstrate intent to violate the statute which is an element of a violation.\nIn addition to AMR\u2019s contracts with healthcare facilities and public agencies, other marketing practices or transactions entered into by EmCare and AMR may implicate the Anti-Kickback Statute. Although we have attempted to structure our past and current marketing initiatives and business relationships to comply with the Anti-Kickback Statute, we cannot assure you that we will not have to defend against alleged violations from private or public entities or that the OIG or other authorities will not find that our marketing practices and relationships violate the statute.\nIf we are found to have violated the Anti-Kickback Statute or a similar state statute, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties, including exclusion from the Medicare or Medicaid programs, or may be required to enter into\nsettlement agreements with the government to avoid such sanctions. Typically, such settlement agreements require substantial payments to the government in exchange for the government to release its claims, and may also require us to enter into a CIA.\nChanges in our ownership structure and operations require us to comply with numerous notification and reapplication requirements in order to maintain our licensure, certification or other authority to operate, and failure to do so, or an allegation that we have failed to do so, can result in payment delays, forfeiture of payment or civil and criminal penalties.\nWe and our affiliated physicians are subject to various federal, state and local licensing and certification laws with which we must comply in order to maintain authorization to provide, or receive payment for, our services. For example, Medicare and Medicaid require that we complete and periodically update enrollment forms in order to obtain and maintain certification to participate in programs. Compliance with these requirements is complicated by the fact that they differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and in some cases are not uniformly applied or interpreted even within the same jurisdiction. Failure to comply with these requirements can lead not only to delays in payment and refund requests, but in extreme cases can give rise to civil or criminal penalties.\nIn certain jurisdictions, changes in our ownership structure require pre- or post-notification to governmental licensing and certification agencies, or agencies with which we have contracts. Relevant laws in some jurisdictions may also require re-application or re-enrollment and approval to maintain or renew our licensure, certification, contracts or other operating authority. Our changes in corporate structure and ownership involving changes in our beneficial ownership required us in some instances to give notice, re-enroll or make other applications for authority to continue operating in various jurisdictions or to continue receiving payment from their Medicaid or other payment programs. The extent of such notices and filings may vary in each jurisdiction in which we operate, although those regulatory entities requiring notification generally request factual information regarding the new corporate structure and new ownership composition of the operating entities that hold the applicable licensing and certification.\nWhile we have made reasonable efforts to substantially comply with these requirements, we cannot assure you that the agencies that administer these programs or have awarded us contracts will not find that we have failed to comply in some material respects. A finding of non-compliance and any resulting payment delays, refund demands or other sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with the terms of our settlement agreements with the government, or if we are unable to favorably resolve current regulatory investigations, we could be subject to additional litigation or other governmental actions which could be harmful to our business.\nIn the last seven years, we have entered into two settlement agreements with the U.S. Government. In September 2006, AMR entered into a settlement agreement to resolve allegations that AMR subsidiaries provided discounts to healthcare facilities in Texas in periods prior to 2002 in violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. In May 2011, AMR entered into a settlement agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) and a Corporate Integrity Agreement (\u201cCIA\u201d) with the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cOIG\u201d) to resolve allegations that AMR subsidiaries submitted claims for reimbursement in periods dating back to 2000. The government believed such claims lacked support for the level billed in violation of the False Claims Act.\nIn connection with the September 2006 settlement for AMR, we entered into a CIA which required us to maintain a compliance program which included the training of employees and safeguards involving our contracting process nationwide (including tracking of contractual arrangements in Texas). The term of that CIA has expired, we have filed a final report with the OIG and this CIA was released in February 2012.\nIn December 2006, AMR received a subpoena from the DOJ. The subpoena requested copies of documents for the period from January 2000 through the present. The subpoena required us to produce a broad range of documents relating to the operations of certain AMR affiliates in New York. We produced documents responsive to the subpoena. The government identified claims for reimbursement that the government believes lack support for the level billed, and invited us to respond to the identified areas of concern. We reviewed the information provided by the government and\nprovided our response. On May 20, 2011, AMR entered into a settlement agreement with the DOJ and a CIA with the OIG in connection with this matter. Under the terms of the settlement, AMR paid $2.7 million to the federal government. We entered into the settlement in order to avoid the uncertainties of litigation, and have not admitted any wrongdoing.\nIn connection with the May 2011 settlement for AMR, we entered into a CIA with the OIG which requires us to maintain a compliance program. This program includes, among other elements, the appointment of a compliance officer and committee, training of employees nationwide, safeguards for our billing operations as they relate to services provided in New York, including specific training for operations and billing personnel providing services in New York, review by an independent review organization and reporting of certain reportable events. On July 1 2013, we divested substantially all of the assets underlying AMR\u2019s service in New York, although the specific CIA compliance program obligations remain in effect for ongoing AMR operations.\nIn July 2011, AMR received a subpoena from the Civil Division of the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Central District of California (\u201cUSAO\u201d) seeking certain documents concerning AMR\u2019s provision of ambulance services within the City of Riverside, California. The USAO indicated that it, together with the OIG, was investigating whether AMR violated the federal False Claims Act and/or the federal Anti-Kickback Statute in connection with AMR\u2019s provision of ambulance transport services within the City of Riverside. The California Attorney General\u2019s Office conducted a parallel state investigation for possible violations of the California False Claims Act. In December 2012, we were notified that both investigations were concluded and that the agencies had closed the matter. There were no findings made against AMR, and the closure of the matter did not require any payments from AMR.\nIn September 2009, a qui tam action was filed against Rural/Metro in the U. S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. The complaint alleged that Rural/Metro had falsified Medicare required documents and billed Medicare and Medicaid improperly for ambulance services. The federal government intervened in the lawsuit on March 14, 2011, and on June 14, 2012, Rural/Metro entered into a settlement agreement with the DOJ and plaintiff, agreeing to pay $5.5 million to the federal government. In connection with this settlement, Rural/Metro entered into a CIA with the OIG (the \u201cRural/Metro CIA\u201d), which requires it to maintain a compliance program. This program includes, among other elements, the appointment of a compliance officer and committee, training of employees nationwide, safeguards for Rural/Metro\u2019s billing operations, review by an independent review organization and reporting of certain reportable events. The term of the Rural/Metro CIA is five years and is set to expire in June 2017. On October 28, 2015, the Company completed its acquisition of Rural/Metro and, therefore, is responsible for compliance with the terms of the Rural/Metro CIA.\nWe cannot assure you that the CIAs or the compliance program we have implemented have prevented, or will prevent, any repetition of the conduct or allegations that were the subject of these settlement agreements, or that the government will not raise similar allegations in other jurisdictions or for other periods of time. If such allegations are raised, or if we fail to comply with the terms of the CIAs, we may be subject to fines and other contractual and regulatory remedies specified in the CIAs or by applicable laws, including exclusion from the Medicare program and other federal and state healthcare programs. Such actions could have a material adverse effect on the conduct of our business, our financial condition or our results of operations.\nOn August 7, 2012, EmCare received a subpoena from the OIG requesting copies of documents for the period from January 1, 2007, through the present that appears to be primarily focused on EmCare\u2019s contracts for services at hospitals that are affiliated with Health Management Associates, Inc. (\u201cHMA\u201d). During the months of December 2013 and January 2014, several lawsuits filed by whistleblowers on behalf of the federal and certain state governments against HMA were unsealed; the Company is a named defendant in two of these lawsuits (the \u201cHMA Lawsuits\u201d). Although the federal government intervened in these lawsuits in connection with certain of the allegations against HMA, the federal government has not, at this time, intervened in these matters as they relate to the Company. The Company has been engaged in dialogue with the relevant federal government representatives in an effort to reach a resolution of this matter. As the Company and these government representatives have made significant progress towards resolution of these matters, the Company recorded a reserve of $30.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2015, based on management\u2019s estimates of probable exposure resulting from the HMA Lawsuits. The reserve has been included in restructuring and other charges in the Company\u2019s statements of operations for the twelve months ended December 31,\n2015. We are unable to predict the timing of final resolution of this matter, and there can be no assurance that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations or cash flow.\nOn December 10, 2012, an OIG subpoena was served on Mercy Hospital, Buffalo, New York, requesting documents related to interfacility specialty care transports provided by Rural/ Metro\u2019s Buffalo division. Rural/Metro provided responsive documents. On April 14, 2014, Rural/ Metro received a second subpoena from the DOJ, Western District of New York, requesting additional information. The investigation was subsequently expanded to include Rural/Metro\u2019s Kentucky market. Rural/Metro is cooperating with the government and is in the process of providing additional responsive documents. We are unable to determine the potential impact, if any, that will result from this investigation.\nOn January 8, 2015, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Arizona issued a Civil Investigative Demand (\u201cCID\u201d) for copies of documents pertaining to ambulance transports provided by Rural/ Metro in its San Diego and Arizona markets. The CID does not provide any information regarding specific allegations or claims made by the government. Rural/ Metro is cooperating with the government during its investigation and has provided responsive documents. We are unable to determine the potential impact, if any, that will result from this investigation.\nOn March 27, 2015, OIG issued a Request for Information or Assistance to Rural/Metro relating to its Arvada, Colorado location. The request does not indicate any specific allegation against Rural/Metro. Rural/Metro is cooperating with the government during its investigation and has provided responsive documents. We are unable to determine the potential impact, if any, that will result from this investigation.\nIf we are unable to effectively adapt to changes in the healthcare industry, our business may be harmed.\nPolitical, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry in the United States to fundamental change. See \u201c-Risks Related to Healthcare Regulation-The impact of recent healthcare reform legislation and other changes in the healthcare industry and in healthcare spending on us is currently unknown, but may adversely affect our business model, financial condition or results of operations\u201d. The PPACA and other changes in the healthcare industry and in healthcare spending may adversely affect our revenue. We anticipate that Congress and state legislatures may continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery and payment systems and may in the future propose and adopt legislation effecting additional fundamental changes in the healthcare delivery system.\nWe cannot assure you as to the ultimate content, timing or effect of changes, nor is it possible at this time to estimate the impact of potential legislation. Further, it is possible that future legislation enacted by Congress or state legislatures could adversely affect our business or could change the operating environment of our customers. It is possible that changes to the Medicare or other government reimbursement programs may serve as precedent to similar changes in other payors\u2019 reimbursement policies in a manner adverse to us. Similarly, changes in private payor reimbursement programs could lead to adverse changes in Medicare and other government payor programs which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in the rates or methods of third-party reimbursements, including due to political discord in the budgeting process outside our control, may adversely affect our revenue and operations.\nWe derive a majority of our revenue from direct billings to patients and third-party payors such as Medicare, Medicaid and private health insurance companies. As a result, any changes in the rates or methods of reimbursement for the services we provide could have a significant adverse impact on our revenue and financial results. The PPACA could ultimately result in substantial changes in Medicare and Medicaid coverage and reimbursement, as well as changes in coverage or amounts paid by private payors, which could have an adverse impact on our revenues from those sources.\nIn addition to changes from the PPACA, government funding for healthcare programs is subject to statutory and regulatory changes, administrative rulings, interpretations of policy and determinations by intermediaries and governmental funding restrictions, all of which could materially impact program coverage and reimbursements for both ambulance and physician services. In recent years, Congress has consistently attempted to curb spending on Medicare, Medicaid and other programs funded in whole or part by the federal government. State and local governments have also attempted to curb spending on those programs for which they are wholly or partly responsible. This has resulted in cost\ncontainment measures such as the imposition of new fee schedules that have lowered reimbursement for some of our services and restricted the rate of increase for others, and new utilization controls that limit coverage of our services. The ambulance service rate decreases under the Congressionally mandated national fee schedule have adversely impacted AMR\u2019s net revenue in prior years. While a further reduced fee schedule was scheduled to go into effect in 2014, Congress extended updates preventing any reductions until January 1, 2018. We may be unable to receive ambulance service rate increases on a timely basis where rates are regulated, or to establish or maintain satisfactory rate structures where rates are not regulated.\nLegislative provisions at the national level impact payments received by EmCare physicians under the Medicare program. One of the primary provisions of the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (\u201cMACRA\u201d) replaces the SGR annual update methodology to determine payments for physicians\u2019 services with a merit based incentive payment system, starting in 2020. Additionally, MACRA included a provision that extends Medicare ambulance add-on payments, supplemental payments based on the point of pickup, until April 1, 2018. The long term impact of MACRA, including the transition to merit based incentive programs, is still being analyzed and we cannot estimate the impact of this legislation on our future revenues.\nThe Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, sets forth across-the-board cuts, or sequestrations, to Medicare reimbursement rates, which began in April 2013. These annual reductions of 2%, on average, apply to mandatory and discretionary spending and have been extended through 2025. Unless Congress takes action in the future to modify these sequestrations, Medicare reimbursements will continue to be reduced by 2%, on average, annually.\nWe believe that regulatory trends in cost containment will continue. We cannot assure you that we will be able to offset reduced operating margins through cost reductions, increased volume, the introduction of additional procedures or otherwise. In addition, we cannot assure you that federal, state and local governments will not impose reductions in the fee schedules or rate regulations applicable to our services in the future. Any such reductions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Substantial Indebtedness\nOur substantial indebtedness may adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from making payments on our indebtedness.\nWe have substantial indebtedness. As of December 31, 2015, we had total indebtedness, including capital leases, of approximately $3,029.7 million, including $750.0 million of Corporation\u2019s 5.125% Senior Notes due 2022 (\u201c2022 Notes\u201d), $2,276.2 million of borrowings under the senior secured term loan facility (\u201cTerm Loan Facility\u201d), and approximately $3.5 million of other long-term indebtedness. In addition, as of December 31, 2015, after giving effect to approximately $140.8 million of letters of credit issued under the asset-backed revolving credit facility (\u201cABL Facility\u201d), we were able to borrow approximately $409.2 million under the ABL Facility. On February 6, 2015, Corporation entered into a Second Amendment to the ABL Credit Agreement, under which certain lenders under the ABL Facility increased the commitments available to Corporation under the ABL Facility to $550.0 million. As of December 31, 2015, we also had approximately $242.9 million in operating lease commitments.\nThe degree to which we are leveraged may have important consequences for holders of our common stock. For example, it may:\n\u00b7\nmake it more difficult for us to make payments on our indebtedness;\n\u00b7\nincrease our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions, including recessions and periods of significant inflation and financial market volatility;\n\u00b7\nexpose us to the risk of increased interest rates because any borrowings we make under the ABL Facility, and our borrowings under the Term Loan Facility under certain circumstances, will bear interest at variable rates;\n\u00b7\nrequire us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other expenses;\n\u00b7\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate;\n\u00b7\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness; and\n\u00b7\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds that may be needed to operate and expand our business.\nDespite our indebtedness levels, we, our subsidiaries and our affiliated professional corporations may be able to incur substantially more indebtedness which may increase the risks created by our substantial indebtedness.\nWe, our subsidiaries and our affiliated professional corporations may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. The Company is not subject to any restriction on its ability to incur indebtedness. The terms of the indenture governing the 2022 Notes and the credit agreements governing the ABL Facility and the Term Loan Facility do not fully prohibit our subsidiaries and our affiliated professional corporations from incurring indebtedness. If the Company\u2019s subsidiaries are in compliance with certain incurrence ratios set forth in the credit agreements governing the ABL Facility and the Term Loan Facility and the indenture governing the 2022 Notes, the Company\u2019s subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness, which may increase the risks created by our current substantial indebtedness. Our affiliated professional corporations are not subject to the covenants governing any of our indebtedness. After giving effect to $140.8 million of letters of credit issued under the ABL Facility, as of December 31, 2015, we were able to borrow an additional $409.2 million under the ABL Facility.\nWe will require a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness. The ability to generate cash or refinance our indebtedness as it becomes due depends on many factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nThe Company and Corporation are each holding companies, and as such they have no independent operations or material assets other than their ownership of equity interests in their respective subsidiaries and our subsidiaries\u2019 contractual arrangements with physicians and professional corporations. The Company and EVHC each depend on their respective subsidiaries to distribute funds to them so that they may pay their obligations and expenses, including satisfying their indebtedness. Our ability to make scheduled payments on, or to refinance our obligations under, our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures and other corporate expenses will depend on the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions, dividends or advances, which in turn will depend on their future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors and any legal and regulatory restrictions on the payment of distributions and dividends to which they may be subject. Many of these factors are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, that currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements will be realized or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable it to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness or to fund our other needs. In order for us to satisfy our obligations under our respective indebtedness and fund our planned capital expenditures, we must continue to execute our business strategy. If we are unable to do so, we may need to reduce or delay our planned capital expenditures or refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. Significant delays in our planned capital expenditures may materially and adversely affect our future revenue prospects. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nThe indenture governing the 2022 Notes and the credit agreements governing the ABL Facility and the Term Loan Facility restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to engage in some business and financial transactions.\nIndenture. The indenture governing the 2022 Notes contains restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to:\n\u00b7\nincur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares;\n\u00b7\npay dividends on, redeem or repurchase stock or make other distributions in respect of our capital stock;\n\u00b7\nmake investments;\n\u00b7\nrepurchase, prepay or redeem subordinated indebtedness;\n\u00b7\nagree to payment restrictions affecting the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends to us or make other intercompany transfers;\n\u00b7\nincur additional liens;\n\u00b7\ntransfer or sell assets;\n\u00b7\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u00b7\nenter into certain transactions with our affiliates; and\n\u00b7\ndesignate any of our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.\nSenior Secured Credit Facilities. The credit agreements governing the ABL Facility and the Term Loan Facility (together, the \u201cSenior Secured Credit Facilities\u201d) contain a number of covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to:\n\u00b7\nincur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares;\n\u00b7\npay dividends on, redeem or repurchase stock or make other distributions in respect of our capital stock;\n\u00b7\nmake investments;\n\u00b7\nrepurchase, prepay or redeem junior indebtedness;\n\u00b7\nagree to payment restrictions affecting the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends to us or make other intercompany transfers;\n\u00b7\nincur additional liens;\n\u00b7\ntransfer or sell assets;\n\u00b7\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u00b7\nenter into certain transactions with affiliates;\n\u00b7\nagree to payment restrictions affecting our restricted subsidiaries;\n\u00b7\nmake negative pledges; and\n\u00b7\ndesignate any of our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.\nThe credit agreement governing the ABL Facility also contains other covenants customary for asset-based facilities of this nature. Our ability to borrow additional amounts under the credit agreement governing the ABL Facility depends upon satisfaction of these covenants. Events beyond our control can affect our ability to meet these covenants.\nOur failure to comply with obligations under the indenture governing the 2022 Notes and the credit agreements governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities may result in an event of default under that indenture or those credit\nagreements. A default, if not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of our indebtedness. We cannot be certain that we will have funds available to remedy these defaults. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds available to pay the accelerated indebtedness or that we will have the ability to refinance the accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us or at all.\nAn increase in interest rates would increase the cost of servicing our debt and could reduce our profitability.\nOur indebtedness under the ABL Facility bears interest at variable rates and, to the extent the rate for deposits in U.S. dollars in the London interbank market (adjusted for maximum reserves) for the applicable interest period (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) exceeds 1.00%, our indebtedness under the Term Loan Facility bears interest at variable rates. As a result, increases in interest rates could increase the cost of servicing such debt and materially reduce our profitability and cash flows. As of December 31, 2015, assuming all ABL Facility revolving loans were fully drawn and LIBOR exceeded 1.00%, each one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in approximately a $28.3 million increase in annual interest expense on the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. The impact of such an increase would be more significant for us than it would be for some other companies because of our substantial debt.\nWe may be unable to raise funds necessary to finance the change of control repurchase offers required by the indenture governing the 2022 Notes.\nUnder the indenture governing the 2022 Notes, upon the occurrence of specific kinds of change of control, Corporation must offer to repurchase the 2022 Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the 2022 Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase. The occurrence of specified events that would constitute a change of control under the indenture governing the 2022 Notes would also constitute a default under the credit agreements governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities that permits the lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder and would require Corporation to offer to repurchase the 2022 Notes under the indenture governing the 2022 Notes. In addition, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities may limit or prohibit the purchase of the 2022 Notes by us in the event of a change of control, unless and until the indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities is repaid in full. As a result, following a change of control event, Corporation may not be able to repurchase the 2022 Notes unless all indebtedness outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities is first repaid and any other indebtedness that contains similar provisions is repaid, or Corporation may obtain a waiver from the holders of such indebtedness to provide it with sufficient cash to repurchase the 2022 Notes. Any future debt agreements that we enter into may contain similar provisions. We may not be able to obtain such a waiver, in which case EVHC may be unable to repay all indebtedness under the 2022 Notes. We may also require additional financing from third parties to fund any such repurchases, and we may be unable to obtain financing on satisfactory terms or at all. Further, our ability to repurchase the 2022 Notes may be limited by law. In order to avoid the obligations to repurchase the 2022 Notes and events of default and potential breaches of the credit agreements governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, we may have to avoid certain change of control transactions that would otherwise be beneficial to us.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe Company is a holding company with no operations of its own, and it depends on its subsidiaries for cash to fund all of its operations and expenses, including to make future dividend payments, if any.\nOur operations are conducted entirely through our subsidiaries and our ability to generate cash to fund all of our operations and expenses, to pay dividends or to meet any debt service obligations is highly dependent on the earnings and the receipt of funds from our subsidiaries via dividends or intercompany loans. We do not currently expect to declare or pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future; however, to the extent that we determine in the future to pay dividends on our common stock, none of our subsidiaries will be obligated to make funds available to us for the payment of dividends. Further, the indenture governing the 2022 Notes and the agreements governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities significantly restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends, make loans or otherwise transfer assets to us. In addition, Delaware law may impose requirements that may restrict our ability to pay dividends to holders of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly. Among the factors that could affect our stock price are:\n\u00b7\nindustry or general market conditions;\n\u00b7\ndomestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance;\n\u00b7\nchanges in our customers\u2019 preferences;\n\u00b7\nnew regulatory pronouncements and changes in regulatory guidelines;\n\u00b7\nlawsuits, enforcement actions and other claims by third parties or governmental authorities;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u00b7\nchanges in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial performance or lack of research and reports by industry analysts;\n\u00b7\naction by institutional stockholders or other large stockholders, including future sales;\n\u00b7\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n\u00b7\ninvestor perception of us and our industry;\n\u00b7\nchanges in market valuations or earnings of similar companies;\n\u00b7\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions or strategic partnerships;\n\u00b7\nany future sales of our common stock or other securities; and\n\u00b7\nadditions or departures of key personnel.\nThe stock markets have experienced extreme volatility in recent years that has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, class action litigation has often been instituted against such company. Any litigation of this type brought against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nFuture sales of shares by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. As of February 19, 2016, we had 187,054,786 outstanding shares of common stock. Of these shares, all of the 179,907,145 shares of common stock sold in our initial public offering in August of 2013, and in the secondary offerings in February, July, and September of 2014, and March of 2015, are freely transferable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), unless purchased by our \u201caffiliates\u201d as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. The remaining shares of our common stock outstanding as of February 19, 2016, are restricted securities within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act, but will be eligible for resale subject to applicable volume, means of sale, holding period and other limitations of Rule 144 under the Securities Act.\nIn August 2013, we filed a registration statement under the Securities Act to register the shares of common stock to be issued under our equity compensation plans and, as a result, all shares of common stock acquired upon exercise of stock options granted under our plans will also be freely tradable under the Securities Act, unless purchased by our affiliates. As of December 31, 2015, there were stock options outstanding to purchase a total of 9,390,316 shares of our common stock and there were 134,700 shares of our common stock subject to restricted stock units. In addition, 16,376,956 shares of our common stock are reserved for future issuances under our Omnibus Incentive Plan.\nIn the future, we may issue additional shares of common stock or other equity or debt securities convertible into common stock in connection with a financing, acquisition, litigation settlement or employee arrangement or otherwise. Any of these issuances could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish misleading or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more analysts downgrade our stock or publishes misleading or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nFuture offerings of debt or equity securities, which would rank senior to our common stock, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIf, in the future, we decide to issue debt or equity securities that rank senior to our common stock, it is likely that such securities will be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility. Additionally, any convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our common stock and may result in dilution to owners of our common stock. We and, indirectly, our stockholders, will bear the cost of issuing and servicing such securities. Because our decision to issue debt or equity securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, holders of our common stock will bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting the value of their stock holdings in us.\nFulfilling our obligations incident to being a public company, including with respect to the requirements of and related rules under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, is expensive and time-consuming, and any delays or difficulties in satisfying these obligations could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and our stock price.\nWe are subject to the reporting and corporate governance requirements, under the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), that apply to issuers of listed equity, which impose certain significant compliance costs and obligations upon us. The changes necessitated by being a publicly listed company require a significant commitment of additional resources and management oversight resulting in increased operating costs. These requirements also place additional demands on our finance and accounting staff and on our financial accounting and information systems. Other expenses associated with being a public company include increases in auditing, accounting and legal fees and expenses, investor relations expenses, increased directors\u2019 fees and director and officer liability insurance costs, registrar and transfer agent fees and listing fees, as well as other expenses. As a public company, we are required, among other things, to define and expand the roles and the duties of our Board of Directors and its committees and institute more comprehensive compliance and investor relations functions.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually, and the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures quarterly. In connection with management's assessment of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, management identified a material weakness in the Company\u2019s internal control over estimates of unbilled revenue for patient encounters in its EmCare segment, which was remediated as of the date of this Annual Report. We cannot\nassure you that our system of internal controls will be able to prevent material weaknesses in our internal controls in the future. If our internal controls prove insufficient to prevent a material weakness in the future, the accuracy of our financial reporting could be adversely affected resulting in reputational harm, distractions to management and our board of directors, and disruptions to our business.\nWe could be the subject of securities class action litigation due to future stock price volatility, which could divert management\u2019s attention and adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe stock market in general, and market prices for the securities of companies like ours in particular, have from time to time experienced volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of the underlying companies. A certain degree of stock price volatility can be attributed to being a newly public company. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In certain situations in which the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. If any of our stockholders were to bring a similar lawsuit against us, the defense and disposition of the lawsuit could be costly and divert the time and attention of our management and harm our operating results.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws could discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws include a number of provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable. For example, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws collectively:\n\u00b7\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by our Board of Directors to thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u00b7\nprovide for our classified Board of Directors, which divides our Board of Directors into three classes, with members of each class serving staggered three-year terms, which prevents stockholders from electing an entirely new Board of Directors at an annual meeting;\n\u00b7\nlimit the ability of stockholders to remove directors;\n\u00b7\nprovide that vacancies on our Board of Directors, including vacancies resulting from an enlargement of our Board of Directors, may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office;\n\u00b7\nprohibit stockholders from calling special meetings of stockholders;\n\u00b7\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders;\n\u00b7\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election as directors or to bring other business before an annual meeting of our stockholders; and\n\u00b7\nrequire the approval of holders of at least 662/3% of the outstanding shares of our common stock to amend our amended and restated by-laws and certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation.\nThese provisions may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if the provisions are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws may also make it difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our management. These provisions may facilitate management entrenchment that may delay, deter, render more difficult or prevent a change in our control, which may not be in the best interests of our stockholders.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe do not intend to declare and pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. We currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth, to develop our business, to fund the share repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors on October 21, 2015, (see \u201c-Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for a discussion of our share repurchase program), for working capital needs and for general corporate purposes. Therefore, you are not likely to receive any dividends on your common stock for the foreseeable future and the success of an investment in shares of our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in their value. There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which stockholders have purchased their shares. In addition, our operations are conducted almost entirely through our subsidiaries. As such, to the extent that we determine in the future to pay dividends on our common stock, none of our subsidiaries will be obligated to make funds available to us for the payment of dividends. The timing of any share repurchases under our recently announced share repurchase program will depend upon marketplace conditions, our capital allocation strategy, and other factors. Further, the indenture governing the 2022 Notes and the agreements governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities significantly restrict the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends, repurchase shares or otherwise transfer assets to us. In addition, Delaware law may impose requirements that may restrict our ability to pay dividends to holders of our common stock or to repurchase shares of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed to us or our stockholders by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (\u201cDGCL\u201d) or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. By becoming a stockholder in our company, you will be deemed to have notice of and have consented to the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation related to choice of forum. The choice of forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.", "PERMNO": 14065, "SIC": 8090, "TIC": "EVHC.1"}
