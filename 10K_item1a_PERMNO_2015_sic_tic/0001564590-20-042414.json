{"cik": "933034", "company": "STRATTEC SECURITY CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-09-03", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe recognize we are subject to the following risk factors based on our operations and the nature of the automotive industry in which we operate:\nCoronavirus or Other Health Epidemics - The Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is adversely affecting, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, our operations and supply chains and we have experienced and expect to continue to experience reductions in demand for certain of our products and services as a result of the pandemic. Because we manufacture our products in facilities around the world, including in Mexico and through our joint venture partners in Europe, China and India, we are and will continue to be vulnerable to an outbreak of COVID-19 (or the resurgence of such an outbreak) or other contagious diseases in those regions as well as in the United States. The effects of COVID-19 and other contagious diseases have included and may continue to include disruptions or restrictions on our ability to travel, our ability to manufacture our affected products and our ability to ship these affected products to customers as well as disruptions that have and may continue to affect our key customers and suppliers, including those in these regions or other affected regions of the world, including in the United States, Mexico, China and neighboring countries. Current and future disruption of our ability to manufacture or distribute our products or of the ability of our customers to take orders of our products or our suppliers to deliver key raw materials on a timely basis has had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our sales and operating results. In addition, the COVID-19 outbreak (or a worsening of this outbreak) and future outbreaks of contagious diseases in the human population has resulted in and could continue to result in a widespread health crisis that adversely affects the economies and financial markets of many countries (including those where we operate or where our products are ultimately used), resulting in an economic downturn that has and could continue to affect demand for our products and impact our operating results.\nWe have been adhering to guidelines and mandates from governmental and health organizations in the territories that we have locations and production facilities, and have implemented various risk mitigation plans to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19. To that end, we have encouraged working remotely where applicable, adopted social distancing where appropriate, implemented travel restrictions, and we are taking actions to ensure that locations and facilities are cleaned and sanitized regularly. All of these actions may impact our operations and profitability. Further, we have complied with and may be required to comply with additional foreign, national, state or local governmental authority recommendations, guidelines, and/or mandates, which have resulted in and may result in additional temporary reduction in or suspension in work at certain of our locations and production facilities. All of these additional actions have and will continue to adversely impact our operating results.\nLoss of Significant Customers, Vehicle Content, Vehicle Models and Market Share - Sales to General Motors Company, Ford Motor Company and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles represented approximately 62 percent of our annual net sales (based on fiscal 2020 results) and, accordingly, these customers account for a significant percentage of our outstanding accounts receivable. The contracts with these customers provide for supplying the customer\u2019s requirements for a particular model. The contracts do not specify a specific quantity of parts. The contracts typically cover the life of a model, which averages approximately four to five years. Components for certain customer models may also be \u201cmarket tested\u201d annually. Therefore, the loss of any one of these customers, the loss of a contract for a specific vehicle model, a reduction in vehicle content, the early cancellation of a specific vehicle model, technological changes or a significant reduction in demand for certain key models could occur, and if so, could have a material adverse effect on our existing and future revenues and net income.\nOur major customers also have significant under-funded legacy liabilities related to pension and postretirement health care obligations. The loss in our major customers\u2019 North American automotive market share to the New Domestic automotive manufacturers (primarily the Japanese and Korean automotive manufacturers) and/or a significant decline in the overall market demand for new vehicles may ultimately result in severe financial difficulty for these customers, including bankruptcy. If our major customers cannot fund their operations, we may incur significant write-offs of accounts receivable, incur impairment charges or require restructuring actions.\nProduction Slowdowns by Customers - Our major customers and many of their suppliers were significantly impacted by the Great Recession of 2008/2009. Many of our major customers instituted production cuts during our fiscal 2009 and 2010. While production subsequently increased after the cuts made in 2009, additional economic slowdowns or pandemics could bring about new production cuts which could have a material adverse effect on our existing and future revenues and net income.\nFinancial Distress of Automotive Supply Base - During the Great Recession, which impacted calendar years 2009 and 2010, deteriorating automotive industry conditions adversely affected STRATTEC and our supply base. Lower production levels at our major customers, volatility in certain raw material and energy costs and the global credit market crisis resulted in severe financial distress among many companies within the automotive supply base. During the above time frame, several automotive suppliers filed for bankruptcy protection or ceased operations. The potential continuation or renewal of financial distress within the supply base (whether from COVID-19 or otherwise) and suppliers\u2019 inability to obtain credit from lending institutions could lead to commercial disputes and possible supply chain interruptions. In addition, the potential for future adverse industry conditions (including from COVID-19 or otherwise) may require us to provide financial assistance or other measures to ensure uninterrupted production. The continuation or renewal of these industry conditions could have a material adverse effect on our existing and future revenues and net income.\nShortage of Raw Materials or Components Supply - In the event of catastrophic acts of nature such as fires, tsunamis, hurricanes and earthquakes or a rapid increase in production demands, either we or our customers or other suppliers may experience supply shortages of raw materials or components. This could be caused by a number of factors, including a lack of production line capacity or manpower or working capital constraints. In order to manage and reduce the costs of purchased goods and services, we and others within our industry have been rationalizing and consolidating our supply base. As a result, there is greater dependence on fewer sources of supply for certain components and materials used in our products, which could increase the possibility of a supply shortage of any particular component. If any of our customers experience a material supply shortage, either directly or as a result of supply shortages at another supplier, that customer may halt or limit the purchase of our products. Similarly, if we or one of our own suppliers experience a supply shortage, we may become unable to produce the affected products if we cannot procure the components from another source. Such production interruptions could impede a ramp-up in vehicle production and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe consider the production capacities and financial condition of suppliers in our selection process, and expect that they will meet our delivery requirements. However, there can be no assurance that strong demand, capacity limitations, shortages of raw materials, labor disputes or other problems will not result in any shortages or delays in the supply of components to us.\nCost Reduction - There is continuing pressure from our major customers to reduce the prices we charge for our products. This requires us to generate cost reductions, including reductions in the cost of components purchased from outside suppliers. If we are unable to generate sufficient production cost savings in the future to offset pre-programmed price reductions, our gross margin and profitability will be adversely affected.\nCyclicality and Seasonality in the Automotive Market - The automotive market is cyclical and is dependent on consumer spending, on the availability of consumer credit and to a certain extent, on customer sales incentives. Economic factors adversely affecting consumer demand for automobiles and automotive production, such as rising fuel costs, could adversely impact our net sales and net income. We typically experience decreased sales and operating income during the first fiscal quarter of each year due to the impact of scheduled customer plant shut-downs in July and new model changeovers during that period.\nForeign Operations - We own and operate manufacturing operations in Mexico. As discussed below under \u201cInvestment in Joint Ventures and Majority Owned Subsidiaries\u201d included in Notes to Financial Statements under Item 8 in this Form 10-K, we also have joint venture and majority owned investments in Mexico, Brazil, China and India. As these operations continue to expand, their success will depend, in part, on our and our partners\u2019 ability to anticipate and effectively manage certain risks inherent in international operations, including: enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems, payment cycles of foreign customers, compliance with foreign tax laws, general economic and political conditions in these countries and compliance with foreign laws and regulations. The success of these joint venture operations may be impacted by our partners\u2019 ability to influence business decisions and therefore the operating results of the joint ventures could be adversely impacted. These influences, as well as conflicts or disagreements with our joint venture partners, could negatively impact the operations and financial results of our joint venture investments, which could have an adverse impact on our financial results. In addition, failure of our partners to be able to continue to fund their portion of the joint venture operations could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and financial results of our joint venture investments, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. The joint venture investments in China generated losses in 2012 and 2013 due to relocation costs associated with moves to a new facility and start-up costs associated with a new product line. These relocation costs and start-up costs have been financed internally and externally by VAST China. Additionally, our VAST LLC joint ventures in Brazil and India continue to report losses due to the weak automotive build in those regions. The impact of any future planned capital expenditures or future expansion by VAST LLC in China, Brazil and India, may result in the need for additional future capital contributions to fund the operations of these joint venture investments.\nCross-border Trade Issues or Tariffs - Our business is impacted by international or cross-border trade, including the import and export of products and goods into and out of the United States and trade tensions among nations. The shipping of goods across national borders is often more expensive and complicated than domestic shipping. Customs and duty procedures and reviews, including duty-free thresholds in various key markets, the application of tariffs, and security related governmental processes at international borders, may increase costs, discourage cross-border purchases, delay transit and create shipping uncertainties. Further, uncertainties stemming from changes in U.S. trade policies in particular with European countries and China, tariffs and the reaction of other countries thereto, could have an adverse effect on our business and may adversely impact our results of operations or financial condition or reduce profitability on certain of our products.\nCurrency Exchange Rate Fluctuations - Our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. We have manufacturing operations in Mexico, and as a result, a portion of our manufacturing costs are incurred in Mexican pesos. Therefore, fluctuations in the U.S. dollar/Mexican peso exchange rate may have a material effect on our profitability, cash flows, financial position, and may significantly affect the comparability of our results between financial periods. Any depreciation in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the value of the Mexican peso will adversely affect the cost of our Mexican operations when translated into U.S. dollars. Similarly, any appreciation in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the value of the Mexican peso will decrease the cost of our Mexican operations when translated into U.S. dollars.\nSources of and Fluctuations in Market Prices of Raw Materials - Our primary raw materials are high-grade zinc, brass, nickel silver, aluminum, steel and plastic resins. These materials are generally available from a limited number of suppliers, but we have chosen to concentrate our sourcing with one primary vendor for each commodity or purchased component. We believe our sources of raw materials are reliable and adequate for our needs. However, the development of future sourcing issues related to using existing or alternative raw materials and the global availability of these materials as well as significant fluctuations in the market prices of these materials may have an adverse effect on our financial results if the increased raw material costs cannot be recovered from our customers.\nGiven the significant financial impact on us relating to changes in the cost of our primary raw materials, commencing with fiscal 2008 and thereafter, we began quoting quarterly material price adjustments for changes in our zinc costs in our negotiations with our customers. Our success in obtaining these quarterly price adjustments in our customer contracts is dependent on separate negotiations with each customer. It is not a standard practice for our customers to include such price adjustments in their contracts. We have been successful in obtaining quarterly price adjustments in some of our customer contracts. However, we have not been successful in obtaining the adjustments with all of our customers.\nDisruptions Due to Work Stoppages and Other Labor Matters - Our major customers and many of their suppliers have unionized work forces. Work stoppages or slow-downs experienced by our customers or their suppliers could result in slow-downs or closures of assembly plants where our products are included in assembled vehicles. For example, strikes by a critical supplier called by the United Auto Workers led to extended shut-downs of most of General Motors\u2019 North American assembly plants in February 2008 and September 2019. A material work stoppage experienced by one or more of our customers could have an adverse effect on our business and our financial results. In addition, all production associates at our Milwaukee facility are unionized. A sixteen-day strike by these associates in June 2001 resulted in increased costs as all salaried associates worked with additional outside resources to produce the components necessary to meet customer requirements. The current contract with our unionized associates is effective through September 17, 2021. We may encounter further labor disruption and we may also encounter unionization efforts in our other plants or other types of labor conflicts, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and our financial results. Labor contracts between General Motors Company, Ford Motor Company and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and their unionized associates under the United Auto Workers union expire in September 2023. In addition, their respective labor agreements with the Canadian auto workers union expire in September and October 2020. Labor disruptions encountered by our customers during the contract period could have an adverse effect on our business and our financial results.\nCompliance Related to Regulations Related to Conflict Minerals - We are required to disclose the use of tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold (collectively, \u201cconflict minerals\u201d) mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries (the \u201ccovered countries\u201d) if a conflict mineral(s) is necessary to the functionality of a product manufactured, or contracted to be manufactured, by us. We may determine, as part of our compliance efforts, that certain products or components we obtain from our suppliers could contain conflict minerals. If we are unable to conclude that all our products are free from conflict minerals originating from covered countries, this could have a negative impact on both our existing and future business, reputation and/or results of operations. We may also encounter challenges to satisfy customers who require that our products be certified as conflict free, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to substantiate such a claim. Compliance with these rules could also affect the sourcing and availability of some of the minerals used in the manufacture of products or components we obtain from our suppliers, including our ability to obtain products or components in sufficient quantities and/or at competitive prices to sell to our customers.\nEnvironmental, Safety and Other Regulations - We are subject to Federal, state, local and foreign laws and other legal requirements related to the generation, storage, transport, treatment and disposal of materials as a result of our manufacturing and assembly operations. These laws include, among others, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (as amended), the Clean Air Act (as amended) and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (as amended). We have an environmental management system that is ISO-14001 certified. We believe that our existing environmental management system is adequate for current and anticipated operations and we have no current plans for substantial capital expenditures in the environmental area. An environmental reserve was established in 1995 for estimated costs to remediate a site at our Milwaukee facility. The site was contaminated from a former above-ground solvent storage tank, located on the east side of the facility. The contamination occurred in 1985 and is being monitored in accordance with Federal, state and local requirements. We do not currently anticipate any material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition or competitive position as a result of compliance with Federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws or other related legal requirements. However, risk of environmental liability and changes associated with maintaining compliance with environmental laws is inherent in the nature of our business and there is no assurance that material liabilities or changes could not arise.\nHighly Competitive Automotive Supply Industry - The automotive component supply industry is highly competitive. Some of our competitors are companies, or divisions or subsidiaries of companies, that are larger than STRATTEC and have greater financial, global and technology capabilities. Our products may not be able to compete successfully with the products of these other companies, which could result in loss of customers and, as a result, decreased sales and profitability. Some of our major customers have previously announced that they will be reducing their supply base. This could potentially result in the loss of these customers and consolidation within the supply base. The loss of any of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our existing and future net sales and net income.\nIn addition, our competitive position in the North American automotive component supply industry could be adversely affected in the event that we are unsuccessful in making strategic investments, acquisitions or alliances or in establishing joint ventures that would enable us to expand globally, in particular, with the VAST Automotive Group and their ability to fund and service global vehicle platforms. We principally compete for new business at the beginning of the development of new models and upon the redesign of existing models by our major customers. New model development generally begins two to five years prior to the marketing of such new models to the public. The failure to obtain new business on new models or to retain or increase business on redesigned existing models could adversely affect our business and financial results. In addition, as a result of relatively long lead times for many of our components, it may be difficult in the short-term for us to obtain new sales to replace any unexpected decline in the sale of existing products. Finally, we may incur significant product development expense in preparing to meet anticipated customer requirements which may not be recovered.\nProgram Volume and Pricing Fluctuations - We incur costs and make capital expenditures for new program awards based upon certain estimates of production volumes over the anticipated program life for certain vehicles. While we attempt to establish the price of our products for variances in production volumes, if the actual production of certain vehicle models is significantly less than planned, our net sales and net income may be adversely affected. We cannot predict our customers\u2019 demands for the products we supply either in the aggregate or for particular reporting periods.\nInvestments in Customer Program Specific Assets - We make investments in machinery and equipment used exclusively to manufacture products for specific customer programs. This machinery and equipment is capitalized and depreciated over the expected useful life of each respective asset. Therefore, the loss of any one of our major customers, the loss of specific vehicle models or the early cancellation of a vehicle model could result in impairment in the value of these assets which may have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nWarranty Claims - We are exposed to warranty claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected, and we may be required to participate in the repair costs incurred by our customers for such products. Our largest customers have recently extended and/or expanded their warranty protection for their vehicles. Other automotive OEMs have similarly extended and/or expanded their warranty programs. We are engaged in ongoing discussions with our customers regarding warranty information and potential claims. The results of these discussions could result in additional warranty charges/claims in future periods. Depending on the nature of and the volume of vehicles involved in the potential warranty claims, these charges could be material to our financial statements. The extended and/or expanded warranty trend may also result in higher cost recovery claims by OEMs from suppliers whose products incur a higher rate of warranty claims above an OEM derived nominal level. Prior to fiscal 2010, we had experienced relatively low warranty charges from our customers due to our commercial arrangements and improvements in the quality, reliability and durability of our products. Due to our largest customers\u2019 extension and/or expansion of their warranty protection programs and demands for higher warranty cost sharing arrangements from their suppliers in their terms and conditions of purchase, including from STRATTEC, we increased our provision to cover warranty exposures since fiscal year 2010. In 2015 and 2018, our increased warranty provision was the result of various known or expected customer warranty issues outstanding and estimated future warranty costs to be incurred as of June 2015 and June 2018, respectively, for which amounts were reasonably estimable. As additional information becomes available, actual results may differ from recorded estimates. If our customers demand higher warranty-related cost recoveries, or if our products fail to perform as expected, it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nCyber Vulnerability - Cyber attacks or security breaches could compromise confidential, business critical information, cause a disruption in our operations or harm our reputation. While we have a cyber security monitoring program, a significant cyber attack could result in loss of critical business information and/or could negatively impact our operations, any of which could have a negative impact on our financial results.\nIncome Taxes - We are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis. While we believe our tax positions are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, it is possible that these positions may be overturned by jurisdictional tax authorities, which may have a significant impact on our global provision for income taxes. Tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of these laws are issued or applied. We are also subject to ongoing tax audits. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve and can be highly subjective. Tax authorities may disagree with certain tax reporting positions taken by us and, as a result, assess additional taxes against us. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision.\nQualified Personnel - Our business success depends, to a significant degree, on attracting and retaining qualified personnel. Our ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire, retain, develop and motivate a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce. These types of employees are in high demand and often have competing employment opportunities. The labor market for skilled employees is highly competitive and we may lose key employees or be forced to increase their compensation to retain these types of employees. Failure to ensure that we have the leadership capacity with the necessary skill set and experience could impede our ability to deliver our growth objectives and execute our strategic plan. Organizational and reporting changes resulting from any future leadership transition or corporate initiatives could result in increased turnover. Additionally, any unplanned turnover or inability to attract and retain key employees could have a negative effect on our results of operations, including by significantly increasing our recruitment, training and other related employee costs. The loss of key personnel, or the failure to attract qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nCredit Facilities - Historically, from time to time we have relied on our existing credit facilities to provide us with adequate working capital to operate our business and fund our capital expenditures, including our expansion initiatives. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to refinance, extend the maturity of, or otherwise amend the terms of our existing credit facilities, or that any refinancing, extension, or amendment will be on terms favorable to us or even on commercially reasonable terms. If our lenders reduce or terminate our access to amounts under our credit facilities, we may not have sufficient capital to fund our working capital needs and/or we may need to secure additional capital or financing to fund our working capital requirements or to repay\noutstanding debt under our credit facilities. Moreover, new credit facilities resulting from any refinancing of our existing facilities could have a significantly higher rate of interest and greater borrowing costs than our existing facilities. We can make no assurance that we will be successful in ensuring our availability of amounts under our credit facilities or in connection with raising additional capital and that any amount, if raised, will be sufficient to meet our cash flow requirements. If we are not able to maintain our borrowing availability under our credit facilities and/or raise additional capital when needed, we may be forced to sharply curtail our efforts to manufacture and promote the sale of our products or to curtail our operations.\nThere can be no assurance that the financial terms or covenants of any new credit facility will be the same or as favorable as those under our existing facilities. Additionally, our ability to complete a refinancing of our existing credit facilities prior to their respective maturities is subject to a number of conditions beyond our control. For example, if a disruption in the financial markets were to occur at the time that we intended to refinance our credit facilities, we might be restricted in our ability to access the credit lines. The restrictive covenants in any such new credit facility may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our best long term interests. A breach of any of these types of restrictive covenants in our credit facilities could result in a default under these facilities. If a default occurs, the lenders under our credit facilities may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable, to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings and to exercise any other rights they have under the facilities or applicable law.", "PERMNO": 81278, "SIC": 3714, "TIC": "STRT"}
