{"cik": "1011290", "company": "99 CENTS ONLY STORES LLC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-04-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Business\nImprovement in our operating performance depends significantly on strategies and initiatives designed to increase sales and improve the efficiencies, costs and effectiveness of our operations. There can be no guarantee that the strategic initiatives we are implementing to improve our results will be successful.\nOver the past several years, we implemented several strategic initiatives, including accelerating store growth, retrofitting our existing store base and enhancing our merchandising and replenishment systems. The accelerated timing in implementing these initiatives and the significant change they brought to our operations placed increased demands on our operating, managerial and administrative resources and also contributed to decreased profitability and other declines in our operating results during fiscal 2016. In response, we are continuing to implement corrective measures focusing on merchandising, supply chain and operational effectiveness that we believe will improve performance over the next several future periods. These measures are in various stages of testing, evaluation, and implementation, upon which we expect to rely to continue to improve our results of operations and financial condition and to achieve our financial plans. These initiatives are inherently risky and uncertain, even when tested successfully, in their application to our business in general. Successful system-wide implementation relies in part on consistency of training, stability of workforce, ease of execution, and the absence of offsetting factors that can influence results adversely. Failure to achieve successful implementation of our initiatives or the cost of these initiatives exceeding management\u2019s estimates could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that these measures, even if successful, will improve our financial results and, if they do, there can be no guarantee as to the timing, sustainability or magnitude of any such improvement. In addition, implementation of these measures has required and may continue to require us to experience short-term cost increases or margin declines. For example, to clear inventory that had built up as a result of the \u201cGo Taller\u201d and global sourcing initiatives, during fiscal 2016, we undertook a range of promotional activities that adversely affected our margins. We were also required to undertake similar activities in fiscal 2017 to clear additional inventory. Poor operating performance could adversely affect our relationships with key vendors, our lenders and other business partners, who may seek to impose stricter credit or other terms on their arrangements with us. Any or all of the foregoing could restrict our operational flexibility and/or impair our liquidity position, which could further adversely affect our operating results and financial condition and cause the trading price of our debt securities to decline. This could also impair our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, including members of management.\nInventory shrinkage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe hold high volumes of inventory and are subject to the attendant risks of inventory loss, spoilage, shrink, scrap and theft (which we collectively refer to as \u201cshrinkage\u201d). Additionally, our strategic initiatives in merchandising and inventory allocation have in the past and may from time to time in the future exacerbate our inventory shrinkage rates. In transition fiscal 2014 and continuing into the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we implemented the \u201cGo Taller\u201d program to increase the length and height of shelving and displays at all retail locations. This remodeling program resulted in increased misplaced and damaged products as items were moved from the shelves to the floor, and increased shipment volumes of inventory to stores, all of which contributed to significant increases in inventory shrinkage. Although we have responded to recent inventory shrinkage charges by reinstating our in-house Loss Prevention department and implementing inventory procedures retraining, we cannot assure you that actual rates of inventory shrinkage will decline or that the measures we are taking will effectively reduce the problem of inventory shrinkage. Although some level of inventory shrinkage is an unavoidable cost of doing business, if we were to experience higher rates of inventory shrinkage or incur increased security costs to combat inventory theft, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have potential risks regarding our store physical inventories and our inventory replenishment and forecasting systems.\nWe maintain a perpetual inventory system in our warehouses, and follow a cycle count program that is adhered to over the course of each year in order to ensure that inventories are accurately reported. We do not maintain a perpetual inventory system in our retail stores. Physical inventory counts are completed at each of the Company\u2019s retail stores at least once a year by an outside inventory service company. Based on the results of annual inventory counts, we have made adjustments to inventory estimates, which at times have been significant. If our controls over inventory records are not appropriately designed or executed to validate the existence, completeness and accuracy of physical inventory quantities, or if our controls related to the validation of assumptions used in the calculation of reserves for excess and obsolete inventory, as well as the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the calculation are insufficient or we do not otherwise continue to improve our inventory processes and procedures, we may fail to adequately reserve for shrinkage and excess and obsolete inventory. These failures could have a materially adverse effect on our store physical inventory results, shrinkage and margins. This in turn could materially affect our ability to timely complete our financial reporting obligations and our financial condition and results or operations.\nAlso, our success depends in part on management\u2019s ability to effectively anticipate and respond to changing consumer preferences, product trends and store inventory needs and its ability to translate these preferences, trends and needs into marketable product offerings in advance of the actual time of sale to the customer. Even if we are successful in anticipating consumer demands, we must continue to be able to develop and introduce innovative, high-quality products in order to sustain consumer demand.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully anticipate changing consumer preferences, product trends, store inventory needs or economic conditions and, as a result, we may not successfully manage inventory levels to meet our future order requirements. If we fail to accurately forecast these needs, we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product required to meet the demand. Inventory levels in excess of consumer demand may result in inventory write-downs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices, which could have an adverse effect on the image and reputation of our brands and negatively impact profitability.\nWe purchase in large volumes and our inventory is highly concentrated. Our results of operations may be negatively affected if we are not successful in managing our inventory effectively.\nOur profitability depends upon our ability to manage appropriate inventory levels and respond quickly to shifts in consumer demand patterns. To be successful, we must maintain sufficient inventory levels and an appropriate product mix to meet our customers\u2019 demands without allowing those levels to increase to such an extent that the costs to store and hold the goods unduly impacts our financial results or that subjects us to the risk of increased inventory shrinkage. Our store and warehouse inventory, net of allowance, approximated $175.9 million and $196.7 million at January 27, 2017 and January 29, 2016, respectively. We periodically review the net realizable value of our inventory and make adjustments to our carrying value when appropriate. The current carrying value of inventory reflects our belief that we will realize the net values recorded on the balance sheet. However, we may not do so, and if we do not, this may result in overcrowding and supply chain difficulties. To obtain inventory at attractive prices, we take advantage of large volume purchases and closeouts. As a result, we carry high inventory levels relative to our sales. In recent periods, primarily as a result of network capacity changes and global sourcing initiatives, we experienced overcrowding in our warehouses, which placed stress on our distribution operations as well as the back rooms of our retail stores. This has also resulted in increased inventory shrinkage due to a variety of factors, including spoilage if merchandise could not be sold in the anticipated timeframes. In transition fiscal 2014, we implemented a new merchandising strategy that significantly increased global sourcing of merchandise from import suppliers, which in part required the purchase of seasonal merchandise up to nine months before its sale. These initiatives thus resulted in unanticipated inventory buildup that was particularly pronounced with respect to seasonal merchandise.\nIf we are unable to effectively manage inventory levels, we may have to sell large portions of inventory at amounts less than their carrying value or write down or otherwise dispose of a significant part of inventory, which could lead cost of sales, gross profit, operating income, and net income to decline significantly during the period in which such event or events occur. In response to the inventory buildup created by the global sourcing program, we implemented inventory liquidation initiatives including short-term promotional activities, which negatively impacted our gross margins and operating results. Margins could also be negatively affected should the grocery category sales become a larger percentage of total sales in the future, and by increases in shrinkage and spoilage from perishable products. In addition, we offer selected items priced above 99.99\u00a2 and we believe that we have additional opportunities to expand our selection of these items. If we are unable to sell these items above 99.99\u00a2 in the volumes that we expect this could further exacerbate the foregoing risks.\nWe are dependent on new store openings for future growth.\nOur ability to generate growth in sales and operating income depends on increasing same-store sales of existing stores and on our ability to successfully open and operate new stores both within and outside of our existing markets and to manage future growth profitably. Our strategy depends on many factors, including our ability to identify suitable markets and sites for new stores, negotiate leases or purchases with acceptable terms, refurbish stores, successfully compete against local competition and the increasing presence of large and successful companies entering or expanding into the markets in which we operate, gain brand recognition and acceptance in new markets, and manage operating expenses and product costs. In addition, we must be able to hire, train, motivate, and retain competent managers and store personnel to support our growth. Many of these factors are beyond our control or are difficult to manage. As a result, we cannot assure that we will be able to achieve our goals with respect to growth. Any failure by us to achieve these goals on a timely basis, differentiate ourselves and obtain acceptance in markets in which we currently have limited or no presence, attract and retain management and other qualified personnel, and effectively manage operating expenses could adversely affect our future operating results and our ability to execute our business strategy.\nA variety of factors, including store location, store size, local demographics, rental terms, competition, the level of store sales, availability of locally sourced merchandise, locally prevailing wages and labor pools, distance and time from existing distribution centers, local regulations, and the level of initial advertising, influence if and when a store becomes profitable. A portion of our new store base may include a portion of stores with relatively short operating histories. We also may not anticipate all of the challenges imposed by the expansion of our operations and, as a result, new stores may not achieve the sales per estimated saleable square foot and store-level operating margins historically achieved at existing stores. If new stores on average fail to achieve these results, planned expansion could decrease overall sales per estimated saleable square foot and store-level operating margins. Increases in the level of advertising and pre-opening expenses associated with the opening of new stores could also contribute to a decrease in operating margins. As we expand, differences in the available labor pool and potential customers could adversely impact us.\nNew stores opened in new markets have in the past been and may in the future be less profitable than existing stores. Some of our new stores may be located in areas where we have minimal operating experience or a lack of brand recognition. Those markets may have different competitive conditions, market conditions, consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets, which may cause these new stores to be initially less successful than stores in our existing markets. In transition fiscal 2014, the Company initiated an accelerated store expansion program, along with other strategic initiatives, that placed pressure on our operational, managerial and administrative resources, and caused our operating results to decline. Consequently, in the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we decided to reduce the pace of future store openings to focus on stabilizing our operations and results. We cannot provide any assurance that we will resume accelerated growth in the future, which could adversely affect our operating results and competitive position. If we fail to successfully execute our growth strategy, including by opening new stores profitably and on schedule, our financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected.\nOpening new stores in existing markets may negatively impact sales at our existing stores.\nNew stores opened in existing markets have in the past been and may in the future result in inadvertent oversaturation and temporarily or permanently divert customers and sales from our existing stores. Following the implementation of the Company\u2019s accelerated store expansion program in transition fiscal 2014, the Company experienced cannibalization of sales at existing stores that contributed to a decline in profitability at our stores and of our same-store sales, and led to the Company\u2019s decision to reduce the pace of future store openings. If in the future we expand our store base too aggressively, sales cannibalization between our stores may become significant and affect our sales growth, and we may experience a similar decline in financial condition and operating results.\nOur operating results may fluctuate and may be affected by seasonal buying patterns.\nHistorically, we have experienced higher volumes of net sales and higher levels of operating income during the quarters that have included the Halloween, Christmas and Easter selling seasons. If for any reason our net sales were to fall below historical levels during the Halloween, Christmas and/or Easter selling seasons, such a decline could have an adverse impact on profitability and impair the results of operations for the entire fiscal year. Transportation scheduling, warehouse capacity constraints, supply chain disruptions, adverse weather conditions, labor disruptions or other disruptions during peak holiday seasons could also affect net sales and profitability for the fiscal year.\nIn addition to seasonality, many other factors may cause the results of operations to vary significantly from quarter to quarter. These factors, some beyond our control, include the following:\n\u00b7 the number, size and location of new stores and timing of new store openings;\n\u00b7 the distance of new stores from existing stores and distribution sources;\n\u00b7 the level of advertising and pre-opening expenses associated with new stores;\n\u00b7 the integration of new stores into operations;\n\u00b7 the general economic health of the extreme value retail industry;\n\u00b7 changes in the mix of products sold;\n\u00b7 increases in fuel, shipping merchandise and energy costs;\n\u00b7 the ability to successfully manage inventory levels and product mix across our multiple distribution centers and our stores;\n\u00b7 changes in personnel;\n\u00b7 the expansion by competitors into geographic markets in which they have not historically had a strong presence;\n\u00b7 fluctuations in the amount of consumer spending;\n\u00b7 the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the growth of the business and our ability to uniformly capture such costs; and\n\u00b7 the timing of certain holidays, such as Easter and Halloween.\nOur ongoing implementation and testing of a new SAP software platform could interrupt operational transactions.\nWe depend on a variety of information systems for our operations, many of which are proprietary, which have historically supported many of our business operations such as inventory and order management, shipping, receiving, and accounting. Because most of our information systems consist of a number of internally developed applications, it can be more difficult to upgrade or adapt them compared to commercially available software solutions.\nAlthough our new SAP system became operational at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we are still currently in the process of migrating our operations from our legacy proprietary system to SAP\u2019s enterprise resource planning software, which includes integrated financial and inventory management systems. There are inherent risks associated with replacing and changing these core systems, including accurately capturing data and possible supply chain and vendor payment disruptions. In addition, this process is complex, time-consuming and expensive. Although we believe we are taking appropriate action to mitigate the risks through testing, training and staging implementation, we can make no assurances that we will not have disruptions, delays and/or negative business impacts from this forthcoming deployment. Any operational disruptions during the course of this migration process, delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of the new SAP system, or in the performance of our legacy systems could materially and adversely affect our ability to effectively run and manage our business. Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to manage our inventory, pay our vendors and record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis, which could be impaired while we are making these enhancements. Portions of our IT infrastructure also may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time. We may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data, which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive, time consuming, disruptive and resource-intensive. Such disruptions could materially and adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other processes. If our information systems do not allow us to transmit accurate information, even for a short period of time, to key decision makers, the ability to manage our business could be disrupted and the results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Failure to properly or adequately address these issues could impact our ability to perform necessary business operations, which could materially and adversely affect our reputation, competitive position, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe could experience disruptions in or increased costs related to receiving and distribution or our transportation network.\nOur success depends upon whether receiving and shipments are processed timely, accurately and efficiently. As we continue to grow, we may face increased or unexpected demands on warehouse operations, as well as unexpected demands on our transportation network. We distribute our products primarily by truck and rail. In addition, we rely on a variety of private fleet and common carriers for our store deliveries/backhauls and vendor pick-ups, and we route our products through various world ports, with the greatest reliance on California ports. In addition, new store locations receiving shipments from distribution centers that are increasingly further away will increase transportation costs and may create transportation scheduling strains. The very nature of our closeout business makes it uniquely susceptible to periodic interruptions and difficult to foresee warehouse/distribution center overcrowding caused by spikes in inventory resulting from opportunistic closeout purchases. Such demands could cause delays in delivery of merchandise to and from warehouses and/or to stores. We periodically evaluate new warehouse distribution and merchandising systems and could experience interruptions during implementations of new facilities and systems. A fire, earthquake, or other disaster at our warehouses or distribution centers could also hurt our business, financial condition and results of operations, particularly because much of our merchandise consists of closeouts and other irreplaceable products. We also face the possibility of reduced availability of trucks or rail cars due to adverse weather conditions, allocation of assets to other industries or geographies or otherwise, which could disrupt our receiving, processing, and shipment of merchandise.\nIn addition, our reliance upon ocean freight transportation for the delivery of our inventory exposes us to various inherent risks, including port workers\u2019 union disputes and associated strikes, work slow-downs and work stoppages, severe weather conditions, natural disasters and terrorism, any of which could result in delivery delays and inefficiencies, increase our costs and disrupt our business. A severe and prolonged disruption to ocean freight transportation could cause delays in delivery of merchandise to our stores and in-stock inventory availability. Efficient and timely inventory deliveries and proper inventory management are important factors in our operations. Reduced product availability may diminish sales and brand loyalty. Severe and extended delays in the delivery of our inventory or our inability to effectively manage our inventory could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe depend upon our relationships with vendors and the availability of closeout merchandise.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to locate and purchase quality closeout merchandise at attractive prices. This supports a changing mix of name-brand and other merchandise primarily at or below 99.99\u00a2 price point. We cannot be certain that such merchandise will continue to be available in the future at wholesale prices consistent with our business plan and/or historical costs. Further, we may not be able to find and purchase merchandise in necessary quantities, particular as we grow, and therefore require a greater quantity of such merchandise at competitive prices. Additionally, vendors sometimes restrict the advertising, promotion and method of distribution of their merchandise. These restrictions in turn may make it more difficult for us to quickly sell these items from inventory. Although we believe we enjoy stable relationships with our vendors, we typically do not enter into long-term agreements or pricing commitments with any vendor. As a result, we must continuously seek out buying opportunities from existing vendors and from new sources. There is increasing competition for these opportunities with other wholesalers and retailers, discount and deep-discount stores, mass merchandisers, food markets, drug chains, club stores, and various other companies and individuals as the extreme value retail segment continues to expand outside and within existing retail channels. There is also a trend towards consolidation among vendors and vendors of merchandise targeted by us, and such larger consolidated entities may enjoy greater purchasing power than we do. A disruption in the availability of merchandise at attractive prices could impair our business.\nWe face risks associated with international sales and purchases.\nInternational sales historically have not been important to our overall net sales. However, some of the inventory we purchase from domestic vendors is manufactured outside the United States. In particular, we will continue to purchase inventory from China, though plan to narrow our focus to sourcing general merchandise and seasonal inventory. If we directly import large volumes of merchandise from overseas vendors, we may be required to order these products further in advance than would be the case if these products were manufactured domestically. International transactions may be subject to risks such as:\n\u00b7 political or financial instability or disputes;\n\u00b7 lack of knowledge by foreign manufacturers of or compliance with applicable federal and state product, content, packaging, ethics and other laws, rules and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n\u00b7 foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and local economic conditions, including inflation;\n\u00b7 uncertainty in dealing with foreign vendors and countries where the rule of law is less established;\n\u00b7 disruptions in the global transportation network, such as raw material shortages, factory consolidations, work stoppages, strikes or shutdowns of major ports or airports, or other political or labor unrest;\n\u00b7 risk of loss due to overseas transportation;\n\u00b7 import and customs review can delay delivery of products as could labor disruptions at ports;\n\u00b7 changes in import and export regulations, including \u201ctrade wars\u201d and retaliatory responses;\n\u00b7 changes in tariff, import duties and freight rates; and\n\u00b7 testing and compliance.\nThe United States and other countries have at times proposed various forms of protectionist trade legislation. We are subject to trade restrictions in the form of tariffs or quotas, or both, applicable to the products we sell as well as to raw material imported to manufacture those products. We may also be subjected to additional duties, significant monetary penalties, the seizure and forfeiture of the products we are attempting to import, or the loss of import privileges if we or our vendors are found to be in violation of U.S. laws and regulations applicable to the importation of our products. Our and our vendors\u2019 compliance with the regulations is subject to interpretation and review by applicable authorities. Any changes in current tariff structures or other trade policies or interpretations could result in increases in the cost of and/or store level reduction in the availability of certain merchandise and could adversely affect our ability to purchase such merchandise and our operations. The results of the recent United States elections may signal a change in trade policy between the United States and other countries. Because a large portion of our merchandise is sourced, directly or indirectly, from outside the United States, major changes in tax policy or trade relations, such as the disallowance of tax deductions for imported merchandise or the imposition of additional tariffs or duties on imported products, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, effective income tax rate, liquidity and net income. In addition, decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, particularly the Chinese renminbi, could increase the cost of products we purchase from overseas vendors. The pricing of our products in our stores may also be affected by changes in foreign currency rates and require us to make adjustments which would impact our revenue and profit.\nDisruptions due to labor stoppages, strikes or slowdowns, shutdowns or major port or airport or other disruptions involving our vendors or the transportation and handling industries also may negatively affect our ability to receive merchandise and thus may negatively affect sales. Prolonged disruptions could also materially increase our labor costs both during and following the disruption. Significant increases in wages or wage taxes paid by contract facilities may increase the cost of goods manufactured, which could have a material adverse effect on our profit margins and profitability. For example, the costs of labor and wage taxes have increased in China, which means we are at risk of higher marginal costs associated with goods manufactured in China.\nThese and other factors affecting our vendors and our access to products, including the supply of our imported merchandise or the imposition of additional costs of purchasing or shipping imported merchandise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations unless and until alternative supply arrangements are secured. Products from alternative sources may be of lesser quality or more expensive than those we currently purchase, resulting in a loss of sales or profit. As we increase our imports of merchandise from foreign vendors, the risks associated with foreign imports will increase.\nOur success depends on our executive officers and key management individuals. If we lose any of these key individuals or are unable to hire additional qualified personnel in a timely fashion, our business may be adversely affected.\nOur future success depends to a significant degree on the skills, experience and efforts of a limited number of key management personnel, including our executive management team. The unexpected loss of the services of any or a significant number of such individuals could result in a loss of management continuity and institutional knowledge and thus adversely affect our business. Other personnel may not have the experience and expertise to readily replace these individuals. As a result, our board of directors may have to search outside of the Company for qualified replacements. This search may be prolonged, and we cannot provide assurance that our executive succession planning, retention or hiring efforts will be successful. We do not maintain key person insurance on any of our executives or key management personnel. Further, the market for qualified executive candidates, who possess the desired talent and competencies, is highly competitive, and may subject us to increased labor costs during periods of low unemployment.\nIn recent periods, we have experienced significant management changes. Specifically, the positions of Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Merchandising Officer each experienced turnover during the past two fiscal years, in some cases multiple times. After an extensive search with respect to each of these positions, we appointed Mr. Jack Sinclair as Chief Merchandising Officer in July 2015, Mr. Geoffrey J. Covert as President and Chief Executive Officer in September 2015, and Ms. Felicia Thornton as Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer in November 2015. We will continue to enhance our management team as necessary to strengthen our business for future growth. Although we do not anticipate additional significant management changes, these and other changes in management could result in changes to, or impact the execution of, our business strategy. Any such changes could be significant and could have a negative impact on our performance and results of operations. In addition, if we are unable to successfully transition members of management into their new positions, management resources could be constrained.\nFailure to attract and retain qualified employees, particularly field, store and distribution center managers, while controlling labor costs, as well as other labor issues, could adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur future growth and performance depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified employees, many of whom are in positions with historically high rates of turnover such as field managers and distribution center managers. Our ability to meet our labor needs, while controlling our labor costs, is subject to many external factors, including competition for and availability of qualified personnel in a given market, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage laws, health and other insurance costs, and changes in employment and labor laws (including changes in the process for our employees to join a union) or other workplace regulation (including changes in \u201centitlement\u201d programs such as health insurance and paid leave programs). To the extent a significant portion of our employee base unionizes, or attempts to unionize, our labor costs could increase. In addition, comprehensive healthcare reform legislation has caused our healthcare costs to increase. We anticipate future increases in the cost of health benefits, partly as a result of the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the \u201cACA\u201d) enacted in 2010, as well as other healthcare reform legislation by Congress and state legislatures, including modification to or the repeal of the ACA. If the ACA is repealed or modified or if new legislation is passed, such action could significantly increase costs of the healthcare benefits provided to our employees, the ultimate costs of which and the potentially adverse impact to the Company and its employees cannot be quantified at this time. If we are unable to control healthcare and pension costs, we may experience increased operating costs, which may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. Furthermore, our ability to pass along increases in labor costs to our customers is constrained by our low price model.\nIncreases in costs and other inflationary pressures may affect our ability to keep pricing almost all of our merchandise at 99.99\u00a2 or less.\nOur ability to provide quality merchandise for profitable resale primarily at a price point of 99.99\u00a2 or less is subject to certain economic factors which are beyond our control. Future increases in costs for items such as merchandise, wages and benefits, shipping, freight, fuel and store occupancy, among others, may reduce our profitability. The minimum wage has increased or is scheduled to increase in multiple states and local jurisdictions and there is a possibility that Congress will increase the federal minimum wage. We can pass price increases on to customers to a certain extent, such as by selling smaller units for the same price and increasing the price of merchandise presently sold at less than 99.99\u00a2, but there are limits to the ability to effectively increase prices on a sufficiently wide range of merchandise in this manner while rarely exceeding a dollar. In certain circumstances, we have discontinued and may continue to discontinue some items from our offerings due to vendor wholesale price increases or reduced availability, which may adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, inflation could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, especially given the constraints on our ability to pass on incremental costs. While we currently offer selected quality merchandise priced above 99.99\u00a2, and believe that there are additional opportunities to expand our selection of these items, an expanded offering of merchandise priced in excess of 99.99\u00a2 may not gain customer acceptance, which could damage our brand name and harm our revenues and profitability. A sustained trend of increased costs and significant inflationary pressure could require us to abandon our customary practice of pricing quality merchandise primarily at a price point of 99.99\u00a2 or less, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nCurrent economic conditions and other economic factors may adversely affect our financial performance and other aspects of our business by negatively impacting our customer\u2019s disposable income or discretionary spending, increasing our costs of goods sold and selling, general and administrative expenses, and adversely affecting our sales or profitability.\nWe believe many of our customers are on fixed or low incomes and generally have limited discretionary spending dollars. Any factor that could adversely affect that disposable income would decrease our customer\u2019s spending and could cause our customers to shift their spending to products other than those sold by us or to products sold by us that are less profitable than other product choices, all of which could result in lower net sales, decreases in inventory turnover, greater markdowns on inventory, and a reduction in profitability due to lower margins. Factors that could reduce our customers\u2019 disposable income and over which we exercise no influence include but are not limited to a slowdown in the economy, a delayed economic recovery, or other economic conditions such as increased or sustained high unemployment or underemployment levels, reduction and/or cessation of unemployment benefit payments and government subsidized assistance programs, concerns over government mandated participation in health insurance programs and increasing healthcare costs, inflation, increases in fuel or other energy costs and interest rates, lack of available credit, consumer debt levels, higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws.\nMany of the factors identified above that affect disposable income, as well as commodity rates, transportation costs (including the costs of diesel fuel), costs of labor, insurance and healthcare, foreign exchange rate fluctuations, lease costs, measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade, changes in other laws and regulations and other economic factors, also affect our cost of goods sold and our selling, general and administrative expenses, which may adversely affect our sales or profitability. We have limited or no ability to control many of these factors.\nIn addition, many of the factors discussed above, along with current global economic conditions and uncertainties, the potential for additional failures or realignments of financial institutions, and the related impact on available credit may affect us and our vendors and other business partners, landlords and service providers in an adverse manner including, but not limited to, reducing access to liquid funds or credit, increasing the cost of credit, limiting our ability to manage interest rate risk, increasing the risk of bankruptcy of our vendors, landlords or counterparties to, or other financial institutions involved in, the Credit Facilities and other contracts, increasing the cost of goods to us, and other adverse consequences which we are unable to fully anticipate or control.\nMaterial damage to, or interruptions to, our information systems as a result of external factors, staffing shortages and difficulties in updating our existing software or developing or implementing new software could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nWe depend on a variety of information technology systems for the efficient functioning of many aspects of our business, including our inventory replenishment systems which are necessary to properly forecast, manage, analyze and record our inventory. We are continually evaluating our information processes and computer systems to better run our business, including through our migration to SAP. These technology improvements may not deliver desired results or may do so on a delayed schedule. Additionally, such systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cybersecurity breaches, natural disasters and human error. Any material interruptions or the cost of replacements may require a significant investment to fix or replace them, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim, may experience loss or corruption of critical data and may receive negative publicity, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nWe also rely heavily on our information technology staff. If we cannot meet our staffing needs in this area, we may not be able to maintain or improve our systems in the future. Further, we still have certain legacy systems that are not generally supportable by outside vendors, and should those of our information technology team who are conversant with such systems leave, these legacy systems could be without effective support.\nWe rely on certain software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems. The software programs supporting many of our systems are maintained and supported by independent software companies. The inability of these companies to continue to maintain and upgrade these information systems and software programs might disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations if we were unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner. In addition, costs and potential interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations.\nImpairment of our goodwill or our intangible assets could negatively impact our net income and stockholders\u2019 equity. We recognized substantial goodwill impairment charges in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 and may be required to recognize additional goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges in the future.\nA substantial portion of our total assets consists of goodwill and intangible assets. Goodwill and certain intangible assets are not amortized, but are tested for impairment at least annually and between annual tests if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our net assets might be impaired. Testing for impairment involves an estimation of the fair value of our net assets and other factors and involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity. There are numerous risks that may cause the fair value of our net assets to fall below its carrying amount, including those described elsewhere in this Report. If we have an impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets, the amount of any impairment could be significant and could negatively impact our net income and stockholders\u2019 equity for the period in which the impairment charge is recorded. During the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we determined that sufficient indicators of impairment existed to require an interim impairment analysis of goodwill and trade name, including (i) overall performance deterioration reflected in decreased comparable same-store sales and cannibalization from stores opened in fiscal 2015 under an accelerated expansion program, (ii) increases in inventory shrinkage and buildup of excess inventory, (iii) decreased margin due to disappointing results from sales promotions and (iv) a decision to delay the pace of future store openings. Our first step evaluation concluded that the fair value of the retail reporting unit was below its carrying value. We performed step two of the goodwill impairment test that requires the retail reporting unit\u2019s fair value to be allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including any intangible assets, in a hypothetical analysis that calculates the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination, including consideration of the fair value of tangible property and intangible assets. As a result of the preliminary results of the impairment test, impairment of goodwill was required and based on our best estimate, we recorded a $120.0 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. The finalization of the preliminary goodwill impairment test was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and resulted in a $20.9 million adjustment in goodwill, lowering the third quarter of fiscal 2016 goodwill impairment charge from $120.0 million to $99.1 million. If operating results continue to change versus our expectations, additional impairment charges may be recorded in the future. If we have an additional impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets, the amount of any impairment could be significant and could negatively impact our net income and members\u2019 equity for the period in which the impairment charge is recorded.\nOur operations are concentrated in California.\nAs of January 27, 2017, 283 of our 390 stores were located in California (with 48 stores in Texas, 38 stores in Arizona and 21 stores in Nevada). We expect that we will continue to open additional stores in as well as outside of California. For the foreseeable future, our results of operations will depend significantly on trends in the California economy and its legal/regulatory environment. Declines in retail spending on higher margin discretionary items and continuing trends of increasing demand for lower margin food products may negatively impact our profitability. California has also historically enacted minimum wages that exceed federal standards; the California minimum wage increased to $10.50 per hour effective January 1, 2017. Moreover, certain municipalities in which our stores are located have set minimum wages above the applicable state standards. Any further increases in the federal minimum wage or the enactment of additional state or local minimum wage increases could increase our labor costs. California typically has other factors making compliance, litigation and workers\u2019 compensation claims more prevalent and costly. Additional local regulation in certain California jurisdictions may further pressure margins.\nNatural disasters, unusually adverse weather conditions, pandemic outbreaks, terrorist acts, and global political events could cause temporary or permanent distribution center or store closures, impair our ability to purchase, receive or replenish inventory, or decrease customer traffic, all of which could result in lost sales and otherwise adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods, tornadoes and earthquakes, unusually adverse weather conditions, pandemic outbreaks, terrorist acts or disruptive global political events, such as civil unrest in countries in which our vendors are located, or similar disruptions could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. To the extent these events result in the closure of one or more of our distribution centers or a significant number of stores, or impact one or more of our key local or overseas suppliers, our operations and financial performance could be materially adversely affected through an inability to make deliveries or provide other support functions to our stores and through lost sales. In addition, these events could result in increases in fuel (or other energy) prices or a fuel shortage, delays in opening new stores, the temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market, the temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from some local and overseas vendors, the temporary disruption in the transport of goods from overseas, delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution centers or stores, the inability of customers to reach or have transportation to our stores directly affected by such events, the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our stores, and disruption of our utility services or to our information systems.\nWe could encounter risks related to transactions with affiliates.\nPrior to the Merger, we leased 13 store locations and a parking lot associated with one of these stores from former members of management and their affiliates, of which 12 stores were leased on a month to month basis. In connection with the Merger, we entered into new lease agreements for these 13 stores and one parking lot. Although the terms negotiated were acceptable to us, we cannot be certain that terms negotiated are no less favorable than a negotiated arm\u2019s length transaction with a third party.\nOur current insurance program may expose us to unexpected costs and negatively affect our financial performance.\nOur insurance coverage reflects deductibles, self-insured retentions, limits of liability and similar provisions that we believe are prudent. However, there are types of losses we may incur but against which we cannot be insured or which we believe are not economically reasonable to insure, such as losses due to employment practices, acts of war, employee, blackouts and certain other crime and some natural disasters, including earthquakes and tsunamis. If we incur these losses and they are material, our business could suffer. In addition, we self-insure a significant portion of expected losses under our workers\u2019 compensation and general liability programs. Unanticipated changes in any applicable actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our recorded liabilities for these losses could result in materially different amounts of expense than expected under these programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we increased workers\u2019 compensation accrual by $7.2 million as a result of higher incurred and projected expenses associated with fiscal 2016 workers\u2019 compensation claims. We have designed and staffed a focused effort to build a culture of safety at 99 Cents designed to reduce the frequency and severity of workers\u2019 compensation claims against us. In fiscal 2017, we experienced an improvement in frequency of claims and anticipation of severity of historical claims. However, we can provide no assurance that costs associated with workers\u2019 compensation claims will continue to decline in the future. Future increases in workers\u2019 compensation costs, if incurred, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Although we continue to maintain property insurance for catastrophic events, we are effectively self-insured for property losses up to the amount of our deductibles. If we experience a greater number of these losses than we anticipate, our financial performance could be adversely affected.\nWe self-insure a portion of our health insurance program that may expose us to unexpected costs and negatively affect our financial performance.\nWe self-insure a portion of our employee medical benefit claims. The liability for the self-funded portion of our health insurance program is determined actuarially, based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported. We maintain stop loss insurance coverage to limit our exposure for the self-funded portion of our health insurance program. Liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported. Unanticipated changes in any applicable actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our recorded liabilities for these losses could result in materially different amounts of expense than expected under these programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face intense competition that could limit our growth opportunities and adversely impact our financial performance.\nThe retail business is highly competitive with respect to price, store location, merchandise quality, assortment and presentation, in-stock consistency, customer service, aggressive promotional activity, customers, and employees. We compete in both the acquisition of inventory and sale of merchandise with other wholesalers and retailers, discount and deep-discount stores, single price point merchandisers, mass merchandisers, food markets, drug chains, club stores and other retailers. We also compete for retail real estate sites. In the future, new companies may also enter the extreme value retail industry. It is also becoming more common for superstores to sell products competitive with our product offerings. Additionally, we currently face increasing competition for the purchase of quality closeout merchandise, and some of these competitors are entering or may enter our traditional markets. Also, companies like ours, due to customer demographics and other factors, may have limited ability to increase prices in response to increased costs without losing competitive position.\nAs we expand, we may enter new markets where our own brand is weaker and established brands are stronger, and where our own brand value may have been diluted by other retailers with similar names, appearances and/or business models. Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources and buying power than we do, as well as nationwide name-recognition and organization. Our ability to compete will depend on many factors including the ability to successfully purchase and resell merchandise at lower prices than competitors and the ability to differentiate ourselves from competitors that do not share our price and merchandise attributes, yet may appear similar to prospective customers. We also face competition from other retailers with similar names and/or appearances. We cannot assure that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors in both the acquisition of inventory and the sale of merchandise.\nWe expect competition to continue to increase. Some of our large box competitors are or may be developing small box formats, and increasing the pace at which they will open the small box formats, which will produce more competition. We remain vulnerable to the marketing power and high level of consumer recognition of these larger competitors and to the risk that these competitors or others could venture into our industry in a significant way. Further, consolidation within the discount retail industry could significantly alter the competitive dynamics of the retail marketplace. This consolidation may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources, improved access to merchandise, greater market penetration and other improvements in their competitive positions, as well as result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by these consolidated companies, which could adversely affect our financial performance.\nIf we fail to protect our brand name, competitors may adopt trade names that dilute the value of our brand name.\nWe may be unable or unwilling to strictly enforce our trademark in each jurisdiction in which we do business. Also, we may not always be able to successfully enforce our trademarks against competitors or against challenges by others. Our failure to successfully protect our trademarks could diminish the value and efficacy of our brand recognition, and could cause customer confusion, which could, in turn, adversely affect our sales and profitability.\nWe are subject to governmental regulations, procedures and requirements. A significant change in, or noncompliance with, these regulations could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nOur business is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations. We routinely incur costs in complying with these regulations. New laws or regulations, particularly those dealing with healthcare reform, hazardous waste, product safety, and labor and employment, among others, or changes in existing laws and regulations, especially those governing the sale of products, may result in significant added expenses or may require extensive system and operating changes that may be difficult to implement and/or could materially increase our cost of doing business. In addition, such changes or new laws may require the write off and disposal of existing product inventory, resulting in significant adverse financial impact to us. Untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable regulations or untimely or incomplete execution of a required product recall can result in the imposition of penalties, including loss of licenses or significant fines or monetary penalties, in addition to reputational damage.\nWe are subject to environmental regulations.\nUnder various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, current or previous owners or occupants of property may face liability associated with hazardous substances. These laws and regulations often impose liability without regard to fault. In the future, we may be required to incur substantial costs for preventive or remedial measures associated with hazardous materials. We have several storage tanks at our distribution and warehouse facilities, including: an aboveground and underground diesel storage tank at one of our City of Commerce, California distribution centers, a compressed natural gas tank at one of our City of Commerce, California distribution centers; an aboveground propane storage tank at one of our City of Commerce, California distribution centers; ammonia storage at our Texas warehouse; an aboveground diesel storage tank at our Texas warehouse; an aboveground propane storage tank at our leased Slauson warehouse in City of Commerce, California; and an aboveground propane storage tank at our leased Los Palos warehouse in Los Angeles, California. Except as disclosed in Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings,\u201d we have not been notified of, and are not aware of, any potentially material current environmental liability, claim or non-compliance. We could incur costs in the future related to owned properties, leased properties, storage tanks, or other business properties and/or activities. In the ordinary course of business, we handle or dispose of commonplace household products that are classified as hazardous materials under various environmental laws and regulations. We have adopted policies regarding the handling and disposal of these products, but we cannot be assured that our policies and training are comprehensive and/or are consistently followed, and we are still potentially subject to liability under, or violations of, these environmental laws and regulations in the future even if our policies are consistently followed.\nLitigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees, consumers, vendors, competitors, shareholders, government agencies and others through private actions, class actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits, regulatory actions and intellectual property claims, is difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to these lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. In addition, certain of these lawsuits, if decided adversely to us or settled by us, may result in liability material to our financial statements as a whole or may negatively affect our operating results if changes to our business operation are required. The outcome of litigation is difficult to assess or quantify and the cost to defend current and future litigation may be significant. There also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could negatively affect customer perception of our business, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable. Reserves are established based on our best estimates of our potential liability. However, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation. Regardless of the outcome or whether the claims are meritorious, legal and regulatory proceedings may require that we devote substantial time and expense to defend our Company. As a result, litigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFor a discussion of current legal matters, please see Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings.\u201d Resolution of these matters, if decided against the Company, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, accrued liabilities or cash flows.\nWe could be exposed to product liability, food safety claims or packaging violation claims.\nWe purchase many products on a closeout basis, some of which are manufactured or distributed by overseas entities, and some of which are purchased by us through brokers or other intermediaries as opposed to directly from their manufacturing or distribution sources. Many products are also sourced directly from manufacturers. The closeout nature of certain of these products and transactions may impact our opportunity to investigate all aspects of these products. We attempt to ensure compliance, and to test products when appropriate, but there can be no assurance that we will consistently succeed in these efforts. Despite our best efforts to ensure the quality, safety and freshness of the products that we sell in all of our stores, we may be subject to product liability claims from customers or actions required or penalties assessed by government agencies relating to products, including but not limited to food\nproducts that are recalled, defective or otherwise alleged to be harmful. Even with adequate insurance and indemnification, such claims could significantly damage our reputation and consumer confidence in our products. We have or have had, and in the future could face, labeling, environmental, or other claims, from private litigants as well as from governmental agencies. Our litigation expenses could increase as well, which also could have a materially negative impact on our results of operations even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued.\nWe may be adversely impacted if our cybersecurity measures fail.\nOur relationships with our customers may be adversely affected if the security measures that we use to protect their personal information, such as credit card numbers, are ineffective or perceived by consumers to be inadequate. We primarily rely on security and authentication technology that we license from other parties. With this technology, we perform real-time credit card authorization and verification with our banks and we are subject to the customer privacy standards of credit card companies and various consumer protection laws. We cannot predict whether there will be a compromise or breach of the technology we use to protect our customers\u2019 personal information. If there is a compromise or breach of this nature, there is the potential that parties could seek damages from us, and we could lose the confidence of customers or be subject to lawsuits or significant fines or penalties from credit card companies or regulatory agencies.\nFurthermore, our servers may be vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions. We may need to expend significant additional capital and other resources to protect against a security breach or to alleviate problems caused by any such breaches.\nWe face risks related to protection of data related to our employees, customers, vendors and other parties.\nAs part of our normal business activities, we collect and store sensitive personal information, related to our employees, customers, vendors and other parties. We have certain procedures and technology in place to protect such data, but third parties may have the technology or know-how to breach the security of this information, and our security measures and those of our technology vendors may not effectively prohibit others from obtaining improper access to this information.\nA security breach of any kind, which could be undetected for a period of time, or any failure by us to comply with the applicable privacy and information security laws, regulations and standards could expose us to risks of data loss, litigation, government enforcement actions and costly response measures (including, for example, credit monitoring services for affected customers, as well as further upgrades to our security measures) which may not be covered by our insurance policies, and could materially disrupt our operations. Any resulting negative media attention and publicity could significantly harm our reputation, which could cause us to lose market share as a result of customers discontinuing the use of debit or credit cards in our stores or not shopping in our stores altogether and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.\nWe need to comply with credit and debit card security regulations.\nIn connection with sales, we transmit confidential credit and debit card information. As a merchant who processes credit and debit card payments from customers, we are required to comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (\u201cPCI DSS\u201d) and other requirements imposed on us for the protection and security of our customers\u2019 credit and debit card information. PCI DSS contains compliance guidelines and standards with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage, processing, and transmission of cardholder data. If we are unable to remain compliant with PCI DSS and other requirements, our business and operations could be adversely affected because we could incur significant fines or penalties from payment card companies or we could be prevented in the future from accepting customer payments by means of a credit or debit card. We also may need to expend significant management and financial resources to become or remain compliant with these requirements, which could divert these resources from other initiatives and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition, business and prospects.\nChanges to accounting rules or regulations may adversely affect our results of operations.\nNew accounting rules or regulations and varying interpretations of existing accounting rules or regulations have occurred and may occur in the future. A change in accounting rules or regulations may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective, and future changes to accounting rules or regulations or the questioning of current accounting practices may adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) released a new lease standard, requiring companies to capitalize substantially all leases, including operating leases, in their financial statements. The new lease standard will be effective beginning after December 15, 2018. The new standard requires lessees to put most leases on their balance sheets but recognize expenses on their income statements in a manner that is largely similar to current accounting. The standard also eliminates real estate-specific provisions for all entities. Currently, substantially all of our leased properties are accounted for as operating leases with limited related assets and liabilities recorded on our balance sheet. The new accounting standard, as currently issued, is currently expected to result in significant changes to our current accounting and would treat each lease as creating an asset and a liability and require the\ncapitalization of such leases on the balance sheet. While this change would not impact the cash flow related to our store leases, we would expect our assets and liabilities to increase relative to the current presentation, which may impact our ability to raise additional financing from banks or other sources in the future. However, even if the new guidance is adopted as issued, certain incurrence ratios and other provisions under the indenture governing the Senior Notes (the \u201cIndenture\u201d) and under the Credit Facilities permit us to account for leases in accordance with the existing accounting requirements. As a result, our ability to incur additional debt or otherwise comply with such covenants may not directly correlate to our financial condition or results from operations as each would be reported under generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) in the United States as so amended.\nOur failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in our financial statements.\nDuring fiscal 2016, management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting with respect to identifying items within our deferred tax balances that could be materially incorrect. Specifically, we did not provide appropriate oversight of our third-party tax preparer. A more complete description of this material weakness is included in Item 9A, \u201cControls and Procedures.\u201d Although we have implemented certain measures that we believe will remediate this material weakness, we can provide no assurance that our remediation efforts will be effective or that additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future. Any failure to maintain or implement required new or improved controls, or any difficulties that may be encountered in their implementation, could result in additional material weaknesses, cause us to fail to meet our periodic or annual reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our financial statements. Any such failure could also adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules promulgated under Section 404. The existence of material weaknesses could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in a restatement of those financial statements.\nRisks Related to Our Substantial Indebtedness\nWe have substantial indebtedness and lease obligations, which could affect our ability to meet our obligations under our indebtedness and may otherwise restrict our activities.\nOur total indebtedness as of January 27, 2017 was $883.2 million, consisting of gross borrowings under our First Lien Term Loan Facility of $593.9 million, borrowings under the ABL Facility of $39.3 million and $250.0 million of our Senior Notes. Availability under the ABL Facility (subject to the borrowing base) was $37.2 million as of January 27, 2017.\nWe also have, and will continue to have, significant lease obligations. As of January 27, 2017, our minimum annual rental obligations under long-term leases for fiscal 2018 are $84.8 million.\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations under the Senior Notes and our Credit Facilities. Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences, including:\n\u00b7 increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry or competitive developments;\n\u00b7 requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;\n\u00b7 exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our borrowings, including borrowings under our Credit Facilities, are at variable rates of interest;\n\u00b7 making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, including the Senior Notes, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions, could result in an event of default under the Indenture and the agreements governing such other indebtedness;\n\u00b7 restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u00b7 imposing restrictions on the operation of our business that may hinder our ability to take advantage of strategic opportunities or to grow our business;\n\u00b7 limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures (including real estate acquisitions and store expansion), debt service requirements and general corporate or other purposes, which could be exacerbated by further volatility in the credit markets; and\n\u00b7 limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to any of our competitors who are less leveraged and who therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting.\nWe and our subsidiaries are still able to incur significant additional amounts of debt, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. The Indenture and our Credit Facilities each contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness. However, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Accordingly, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. We have additional availability under our ABL Facility subject to the borrowing base of $37.2 million as of January 27, 2017.\nSubject to certain limitations and the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the receipt of commitments for additional borrowings, we were also permitted to incur up to an aggregate of $50.0 million of additional borrowings pursuant to incremental facilities under the First Lien Term Loan Facility and up to an aggregate of $25.0 million of additional revolving commitments (subject to the borrowing base) pursuant to the ABL Facility. If new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries\u2019 current debt levels, the risks that we now face as a result of our leverage would intensify and could have a negative impact on our credit rating.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness or repay such indebtedness when due, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal of, and premium, if any, and additional interest, if any, on, our indebtedness, including the Senior Notes.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the Senior Notes. Our First Lien Term Loan Facility matures on January 13, 2019, and our Senior Notes mature on December 15, 2019. While the maturity date of our ABL Facility has been conditionally extended to April 8, 2021 in connection with the Fourth Amendment, such extension resulted in higher interest rates and, if our First Lien Term Loan Facility and Senior Notes are not refinanced or amended to extend the final maturity dates thereof to a date that is at least 180 days after April 8, 2021, our ABL Facility will mature on the earlier of (i) the date that is 90 days prior to the stated maturity date in respect of our First Lien Term Loan Facility and (ii) the date that is 90 days prior to the stated maturity date in respect of the Senior Notes. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of the Indenture and our Credit Facilities or any future debt instruments that we may enter into may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Perceived liquidity issues resulting from any such failure to make payments of interest or principal or restructure or refinance our existing debt could adversely affect our relationships with key vendors, our lenders and other business partners, who may seek to impose stricter credit or other terms on their arrangements with us, including by requiring us to post collateral to secure our obligations, which could in turn materially and adversely affect our business and operations.\nFailure to comply with the financial requirements under our ABL Facility could result in decreased credit availability and reduced distributions.\nAdditional borrowing under our ABL Facility is dependent on the maintenance of certain liquidity levels, compliance with financial ratio covenants, the borrowing base and other provisions set forth in the ABL Facility. Our ABL Facility contains additional restrictive provisions that are imposed if \u201cexcess availability\u201d falls below the greater of (x) 15% of the maximum credit under the ABL Facility and (y) $25.0 million for five (5) consecutive Business Days. Operating under \u201ccash dominion\u201d would increase our reporting requirements, operational complexities for the Company and permit the administrative agent to invoke control rights over certain of our accounts. Further, under the ABL Facility, we could in the future be required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.00 to 1.00 when \u201cexcess availability\u201d falls below the greater of (i) 12.5% of the maximum credit under the ABL Facility and (y) $20.0 million. As of January 27, 2017, our fixed charge coverage ratio was less than 1.00 to 1.00. A decrease in excess availability as a result of decreases in inventory, increases in outstanding debt (including letters of credit) or otherwise, could cause our excess availability to fall below the \u201ccash dominion\u201d trigger, which would subject us to additional requirements and restrict access to borrowings under the ABL Facility, which would adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to execute our strategic plan.\nOur debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nOur Credit Facilities and the Indenture contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit our Parent\u2019s (solely with respect to our Credit Facilities) and our restricted subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things:\n\u00b7 incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares;\n\u00b7 pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of our capital stock or make other restricted payments;\n\u00b7 make certain investments;\n\u00b7 transfer or sell certain assets;\n\u00b7 create or incur liens;\n\u00b7 consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u00b7 enter into certain transactions with our affiliates.\nA breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under one or more of these agreements, including as a result of cross default provisions, and, in the case of our Credit Facilities, permit the lenders to cease making loans to us. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our Credit Facilities, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our Credit Facilities to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit under the ABL Facility. Such actions by those lenders could cause cross defaults under our other indebtedness. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under our Credit Facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. We have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under our Credit Facilities. If the lenders under our Credit Facilities accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to repay our Credit Facilities as well as our other indebtedness, including the Senior Notes.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under our Credit Facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates continue to increase, our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed would remain the same, and our net income and cash flow, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease.\nChanges in our credit ratings may limit our access to capital markets and adversely affect our liquidity.\nThe credit rating agencies periodically review our capital structure and the quality and stability of our earnings. Any future downgrades to our long-term credit ratings could result in reduced access to the credit and capital markets and higher interest costs on future financings. The future availability of financing will depend on a variety of factors such as economic and market conditions, the availability of credit and our credit ratings, as well as the possibility that lenders could develop a negative perception of us. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all.\nCertain investment funds affiliated with Ares and CPPIB own substantially all the equity of Parent, and their interests may not be aligned with those of the holders of the Senior Notes.\nWe are controlled by Ares and CPPIB. Ares and CPPIB control the election of a majority of our directors and thereby have the power to control our affairs and policies, including the appointment of management, the issuance of additional stock and the declaration and payment of dividends. Ares and CPPIB do not have any liability for any obligations under the Senior Notes and their interests may be in conflict with yours. For example, if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts as they mature, Ares and CPPIB may pursue strategies that favor equity investors over debt investors. In addition, our equity holders may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financing or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investments, even though such transactions may involve risk to the holders of the Senior Notes. Additionally, Ares and CPPIB may make investments in businesses that directly or indirectly compete with us, or may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. For information concerning our arrangements with Ares and CPPIB, see Item 13, \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Transactions\u201d for more information.\nInvestment funds advised by entities affiliated with Ares and CPPIB have in the past and may in the future buy or sell portions of our debt in open market transactions at any time.", "PERMNO": 83452, "SIC": 5331, "TIC": "NDN"}
