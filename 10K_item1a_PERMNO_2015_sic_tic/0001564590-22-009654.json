Our results of operations depend upon many factors including our ability to implement our business strategy, the availability of opportunities to acquire assets, the level and volatility of interest rates, the cost and availability of short- and long-term credit, financial market conditions and general economic conditions.\nThe following discussion concerns the material risks associated with our business. These risks are interrelated, and you should consider them as a whole. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us may also materially and adversely affect the value of our capital stock and our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders. In connection with the forward-looking statements that appear in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including these risk factors and elsewhere, you should carefully review the section entitled \u201cCautionary Statement About Forward-Looking Information.\u201d\nRisks Related to our Investing and Financing Activities\nWe may change our investment strategy, hedging strategy, asset allocation and operational policies without shareholder consent, which may result in riskier investments and may adversely affect our results of operations and the market value of our securities.\nWe may change our investment strategy, hedging strategy, asset allocation and operational policies at any time without the consent of our shareholders, which could result in our making investment or hedge decisions that are different from, and possibly riskier than, the investments and hedges described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A change in our investment or hedging strategy may increase our exposure to interest rate and real estate market fluctuations. A change in our asset allocation could result in us making investments in securities, assets or business different from those described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our Board of Directors oversees our operational policies, including those with respect to our acquisitions, growth, operations, indebtedness, capitalization and distributions and approves transactions that deviate from these policies without a vote of, or notice to, our shareholders. Operational policy changes could adversely affect the market value of our securities and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders. Investing in assets or businesses other than our historical investment strategies may not be successful and could adversely affect our results of operations and the market value of our securities.\nWe may enter into new lines of business, acquire other companies or engage in other strategic initiatives, each of which may result in additional risks and uncertainties in our businesses.\nWe may pursue growth through acquisitions of other companies or other strategic initiatives that may require approval by our Board of Directors, stockholders, or both. To the extent we pursue strategic investments or acquisitions, undertake other strategic initiatives or consider new lines of business, we will face numerous risks and uncertainties, including risks associated with:\n\u2022\nthe availability of suitable opportunities;\n\u2022\nthe level of competition from other companies that may have greater financial resources;\n\u2022\nour ability to value potential acquisition opportunities accurately and negotiate acceptable terms for those opportunities;\n\u2022\nthe required investment of capital and other resources;\n\u2022\nthe lack of availability of financing and, if available, the terms of any financings;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that we have insufficient expertise to engage in such activities profitably or without incurring inappropriate amounts of risk;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from our core businesses;\n\u2022\nassumption of liabilities in any acquired business;\n\u2022\nthe disruption of our ongoing businesses;\n\u2022\nthe increasing demands on or issues related to combining or integrating operational and management systems and controls;\n\u2022\ncompliance with additional regulatory requirements; and\n\u2022\ncosts associated with integrating and overseeing the operations of the new businesses.\nEntry into certain lines of business may subject us to new laws and regulations with which we are not familiar, or from which we are currently exempt, and may lead to increased litigation and regulatory risk. In addition, if a new business generates insufficient revenues or if we are unable to efficiently manage our expanded operations, our results of operations will be adversely affected. Our strategic initiatives may include joint ventures, in which case we will be subject to additional risks and uncertainties in that we may be dependent upon, and subject to liability, losses or reputational damage relating to, systems, controls and personnel that are not under our control.\nOur Board of Directors does not approve each of our investment, financing and hedging decisions.\nOur Board of Directors oversees our operational policies and periodically reviews our investment guidelines and our investment portfolio. However, our Board of Directors does not review all of our proposed investments. In addition, in conducting periodic reviews, our Board of Directors may rely primarily on information provided to them by our management. Furthermore, transactions entered into or structured for us by our management may be difficult or impossible to unwind by the time they are reviewed by our Board of Directors.\nChanges in interest rates and adverse market conditions could negatively affect the value of our investments and increase the cost of our borrowings, which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur investment portfolio includes fixed-rate agency MBS with long-term maturities. The majority of our funding is in the form of repurchase agreements with short-term maturities with an interest rate that resets upon maturity and rolling the repurchase agreement financing to a new maturity date. We are exposed to interest rate risk that fluctuates based on changes in the level or volatility of interest rates and in the shape and slope of the yield curve. Under a normal yield curve, long-term interest rates are higher relative to short-term interest rates. In certain instances, the yield curve can become inverted when the short-term interest rates are higher than the long-term interest rates.\nA significant risk associated with our portfolio of mortgage-related assets is the risk that both long-term and short-term interest rates will increase significantly. If long-term rates were to increase significantly, the market value of fixed-rate agency MBS would decline and the duration and weighted average life of these MBS would increase. We could realize a loss in the future if the agency MBS in our portfolio are sold. If short-term interest rates were to increase, the financing costs on the repurchase agreements we enter into in order to finance the purchase of MBS would increase, thereby decreasing net interest margin if all other factors remain constant.\nIncreases in interest rates may also have an adverse impact on our SFR investments if we are unable to increase rents or acquire SFR homes with rates high enough to offset the increase in interest rates on our borrowings. Conversely, decreases in interest rates may lead to additional competition for the acquisition of SFR homes, which may lead to future acquisitions being more costly and resulting in lower yields.\nHedging against interest rate exposure may not completely insulate us from interest rate risk and may adversely affect our earnings.\nWe engage in certain hedging transactions to limit our exposure from the adverse effects of changes in interest rates on the borrowing costs of our short-term financing agreements and the value of our fixed-rate agency MBS investment portfolio, and therefore may expose our company to the risks associated with such transactions. We have historically entered into and may enter into interest rate swap agreements, U.S. Treasury note futures, Eurodollar futures, interest rate swap futures, options on U.S. Treasury note futures, options on agency MBS, TBAs or may pursue other hedging strategies. Our hedging activities are generally designed to limit certain exposures and not to eliminate them. Hedging against a decline in the values of our portfolio positions does not eliminate the possibility of fluctuations in the values of such positions or prevent losses if the values of such positions decline. Such hedging transactions may also limit the opportunity for gain if the values of the portfolio positions should increase. Moreover, it may not be possible to hedge against an interest rate fluctuation that is so generally anticipated that we are not able to enter into a hedging transaction at an acceptable price.\nThere are no perfect hedging strategies, and interest rate hedging may fail to protect us from loss. The success of our hedging transactions depends on our ability to accurately predict movements of interest rates and credit spreads. In addition, the degree of correlation between price movements of the instruments used in a hedging strategy and price movements in the portfolio positions being hedged may vary. Moreover, for a variety of reasons, we may not seek to establish a perfect correlation between such hedging instruments and the portfolio holdings being hedged. Any such imperfect correlation may prevent us from achieving the intended hedge and expose us to risk of loss. Furthermore, our hedging strategies may adversely affect us because hedging activities involve costs that we incur regardless of the effectiveness of the hedging activity, which may decrease our net interest margin. Our hedging activity will vary in scope based on the level and volatility of interest rates and principal prepayments, the amount of leverage, the type of MBS held, the form and tenor of financing arrangements, and other changing market conditions.\nInterest rate hedging may fail to protect or could adversely affect us because, among other things:\n\u2022\ninterest rate hedging can be expensive, particularly during periods of rising and volatile interest rates;\n\u2022\navailable interest rate hedging may not correspond directly with the interest rate risk for which protection is sought;\n\u2022\nthe duration of the hedge may not match the duration of the related asset or liability;\n\u2022\nthe amount of income that a REIT may earn from hedging transactions other than hedging transactions that satisfy certain requirements of the Internal Revenue Code or that are done through a TRS is limited by federal tax provisions governing REITs;\n\u2022\nthe value of our interest rate hedges declines due to interest rate fluctuations, lapse of time or other factors; and\n\u2022\nthe party owing money in the hedging transaction may default on its obligation to pay.\nOur hedging activity may adversely affect our earnings and result in volatile fluctuations in the fair value of our hedges, net income and book value per share.\nOur hedging strategies are generally not designed to mitigate spread risk.\nWhen the market spread widens between the yield on our mortgage assets and benchmark interest rates, our net book value could decline if the fair value of our mortgage assets falls by more than the offsetting fair value increases on our hedging instruments tied to the underlying benchmark interest rates or if the fair value of our mortgage assets do not increase as much as the fair value decreases on our hedging instruments. We refer to this scenario as an example of \u201cspread risk\u201d or \u201cbasis risk.\u201d The spread risk associated with our mortgage assets and the resulting fluctuations in fair value of these securities can occur independently of changes in benchmark interest rates and may relate to other factors impacting the mortgage and fixed income markets, such as actual or anticipated monetary policy actions by the Federal Reserve, market liquidity, changes in expected prepayments, or changes in required rates of return on different assets. Consequently, while we use various interest rate hedging instruments to attempt to protect against moves in interest rates, such instruments typically will not protect our net book value against spread risk, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nDeclines in the market values of our investment portfolio may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and market price of your investments in our securities.\nCertain of our investments are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value reported in net income. As a result, a decline in the fair value of our investments would reduce our net income and book value per share. Fair values for our investments can be volatile. The fair values can change rapidly and significantly, and changes can result from various factors, including changes in interest rates, actual and perceived risk, supply, demand, expected prepayment rates, and actual and projected credit performance.\nDeclines in the market values of our investment portfolio would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and market price of your investments in our securities.\nOur investment strategy involves significant leverage, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may increase our investment exposure by funding a portion of new investments with repurchase agreements or other borrowing arrangements. To the extent that revenue derived from such levered assets exceeds our interest expense, hedging expense and other costs of the financing, our net income will be greater than if we had not borrowed funds and had not invested in such assets on a leveraged basis. Conversely, if the revenue from our investment do not sufficiently cover the interest expense, hedging expense and other costs of the financing, our net income will be less or our net loss will be greater than if we had not borrowed funds. Because of the credit and interest rate risks inherent in our investment strategies, we closely monitor the leverage of our investment portfolio. From time to time, our leverage ratio may increase or decrease due to several factors, including changes in the value of the underlying portfolio, changes in investment allocations and the timing and amount of acquisitions.\nAn increase in our borrowing costs relative to the interest we receive on our assets may adversely affect our profitability.\nAs our repurchase agreements and other short-term borrowings mature, we must either enter into new borrowings or liquidate certain of our investments at times when we might not otherwise choose to do so. Lenders may also seek to use a maturity date as an opportune time to demand additional terms or increased collateral requirements that could be adverse to us and harm our operations. Due to the short-term nature of our repurchase agreements used to finance our investments, our borrowing costs are particularly sensitive to changes in short-term interest rates. An increase in short-term interest rates when we seek new borrowings would reduce the spread between our returns on our assets and the cost of our borrowings and may adversely affect our liquidity position, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDifferences in the stated maturity of our fixed-rate assets and short-term borrowings may adversely affect our profitability.\nWe rely primarily on short-term borrowings to acquire fixed-rate securities with long-term maturities. The relationship between short-term and longer-term interest rates is often referred to as the \u201cyield curve.\u201d Ordinarily, short-term interest rates are lower than longer-term interest rates. If short-term interest rates rise disproportionately relative to longer-term interest rates, resulting in a \u201cflattening\u201d of the yield curve, our borrowing costs may increase more rapidly than the interest income earned on our assets. Because our investments generally bear interest at longer-term rates than we pay on our borrowings under our repurchase agreements, a flattening of the yield curve would tend to decrease our net interest income and the market value of our investment portfolio. Additionally, to the extent cash flows from investments that return principal are reinvested, the spread between the yields on the new investments and available borrowing rates may decline, which would likely decrease our net income. It is also possible that short-term interest rates may exceed longer-term interest rates (a yield curve \u201cinversion\u201d), in which event, our borrowing costs may exceed our interest income and we could incur operating losses and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders could be hindered.\nOur lenders may require us to provide additional collateral, especially when the market values for our investments decline, which may restrict us from leveraging our assets as fully as desired, and reduce or eliminate our liquidity and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe currently use repurchase agreements to finance our investments in agency MBS and other mortgage assets. Our repurchase agreements allow the lenders, to varying degrees, to determine a new market value of the collateral to reflect current market conditions. If the market value of the securities pledged or sold by us to a funding source declines in value, as occurred with great regularity during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may be required by the lender to provide additional collateral or pay down a portion of the funds advanced on minimal notice, which is known as a margin call. We also use a credit facility to finance our investments in SFR properties. Under the terms of the credit facility, if the outstanding principal balance is greater than 74% of the fair value of the collateral, we are required to pledge additional collateral or prepay the loan in an amount so that the outstanding principal balance does not exceed 74% of the fair value of the collateral. Posting additional collateral will reduce our liquidity and limit our ability to leverage our assets, which could adversely affect our business. Additionally, in order to satisfy a margin call, we may be required to liquidate assets at a disadvantageous time, which could cause us to incur further losses and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In the event we do not have sufficient liquidity to satisfy these margin calls, lending institutions can accelerate our indebtedness, increase our borrowing rates, liquidate our collateral and terminate our ability to borrow. Such a situation would likely result in a rapid deterioration of our financial condition and possibly necessitate a filing for protection under the bankruptcy code.\nClearing facilities or exchanges upon which some of our hedging instruments are traded may increase margin requirements on our hedging instruments in the event of adverse economic developments.\nOur interest rate hedging agreements typically require that we pledge collateral on such agreements. We exchange collateral with the counterparties to our interest rate hedging instruments at least on a daily basis based upon daily changes in fair value (also known as \u201cvariation margin\u201d) as measured by the central clearinghouse through which those instruments are cleared. In addition, the central clearinghouse requires market participants to deposit and maintain an \u201cinitial margin\u201d amount which is determined by the clearinghouse and is generally intended to be set at a level sufficient to protect the clearinghouse from the maximum estimated single-day price movement in that market participant\u2019s contracts. The clearing exchanges have the sole discretion to determine the value of the instruments. In the event of a margin call, we must generally provide additional collateral on the same business day. In response to events having or expected to have adverse economic consequences or which create market uncertainty, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, clearing facilities or exchanges upon which our hedging instruments are traded may require us to pledge additional collateral against our hedging instruments. In the event that future adverse economic developments or market uncertainty result in increased margin requirements for our hedging instruments, it could materially adversely affect our liquidity position, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain adequate financing or to renew or replace existing borrowings upon maturity, we will be limited in our ability to implement our investing activities, which will adversely affect our results of operations and may, in turn, negatively affect the market value of your investment in our securities.\nWe depend upon repurchase agreement financing to purchase agency MBS and other mortgage assets and reach our target leverage ratio. We cannot assure you that sufficient repurchase agreement financing will be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable to us. Our lenders also may revise their eligibility requirements for the types of assets they are willing to finance or the terms of such financings based on, among other factors, the regulatory environment and their perceived risk. If we fail to obtain adequate funding or to renew or replace existing funding upon maturity, we will be limited in our ability to implement our business strategy, which will adversely affect our results of operations and may, in turn, negatively affect the market value of your investments in our securities.\nNew assets we acquire may not generate yields as attractive as yields on our current assets, resulting in a decline in our earnings over time.\nWe receive monthly cash flows consisting of principal and interest payments from many of our assets. Principal payments reduce the size of our current portfolio (i.e., reduce the amount of our long-term assets) and generate cash for us. We may also sell assets from time to time as part of our portfolio management and capital reallocation strategies. In order to maintain or grow our portfolio size and our earnings, we must reinvest in new assets a portion of the cash flows we receive from principal repayments and asset sales. New investment opportunities may not generate the same investment returns as our current investment portfolio. If the assets we acquire in the future earn lower returns than the assets we currently own, our reported earnings will likely decline over time as the older assets pay down, are called, or are sold.\nOur agency MBS investments that are guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are subject to the risk that these GSEs may not be fully able to satisfy their guarantee obligations or that these guarantee obligations may be repudiated, which would adversely affect the value of our investment portfolio and our ability to sell or finance these securities.\nAll of the agency MBS in which we invest depend on a steady stream of payments on the mortgages underlying the MBS. The interest and principal payments we receive on agency MBS issued by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac are guaranteed by these GSEs, but are not guaranteed by the U.S. government. To the extent these GSEs are not able to fully satisfy their guarantee obligations or that these guarantee obligations are repudiated or otherwise defaulted upon, the value of our investment portfolio and our ability to sell or finance these securities would be adversely affected.\nThe conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and related efforts, along with any changes in laws and regulations affecting the relationship between Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the federal government, may adversely affect our business.\nThe interest and principal payments we receive on agency MBS issued by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac are guaranteed by these GSEs and not guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are currently regulated by the FHFA, HUD, SEC and U.S. Treasury, and are currently operating under the conservatorship of the FHFA, which is a statutory process pursuant to which the FHFA operates Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in an effort to stabilize the entities. As part of these actions, the U.S. Treasury has agreed to support the continuing operations of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac with any necessary capital contributions up to a maximum capital commitment to each GSE while in conservatorship. Although the U.S. Treasury has committed to support the positive net worth of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two GSEs could default on their guarantee obligations, which would materially and adversely affect the value of our agency MBS.\nIn addition, the future roles of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could be significantly reduced or eliminated and the nature of their guarantees could be eliminated or considerably limited relative to historical measurements. Any changes to the nature of the guarantees provided by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could redefine what constitutes agency MBS, have broad adverse market implications and negatively impact us. The FHFA and both houses of Congress have each discussed and considered separate measures intended to restructure the U.S. housing finance system and the operations of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The passage of any additional new legislation affecting Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac may create market uncertainty and reduce the actual or perceived credit quality of securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government through a new or existing successor entity to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. If the charters of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were revoked, it is unclear what effect, if any, this would have on the value of the existing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac agency MBS. We anticipate debate and discussion on residential housing and mortgage reform to continue; however, we cannot be certain if any housing and/or mortgage-related legislation will emerge from committee, be approved by Congress, or be affected by any executive actions and, if so, what the effect will be on our business.\nThe value of our MSR related assets may vary substantially with changes in interest rates.\nThe values of our MSR related assets are highly sensitive to changes in interest rates. The value of MSRs typically increases when interest rates rise and decreases when interest rates decline due to the effect those changes in interest rates have on prepayment estimates. Subject to qualifying and maintaining our qualification as a REIT, we may pursue various hedging strategies to seek to reduce our exposure to adverse changes in interest rates. Our hedging activity will vary in scope based on the level and volatility of interest rates, the type of assets held and other changing market conditions. Interest rate hedging may fail to protect or could adversely affect us. To the extent we do not utilize hedging instruments to hedge against changes in the fair value of our MSR related assets, our balance sheet, results of operations and cash flows would be susceptible to significant volatility due to changes in the fair value of, or cash flows from, those assets as interest rates change.\nChanges in prepayment rates may adversely affect our profitability and are difficult to predict.\nOur investment portfolio includes securities backed by pools of residential mortgage loans. For securities backed by pools of residential mortgage loans, we receive income, generally, from the payments that are made by the borrowers of the underlying mortgage loans. When borrowers prepay their mortgage loans at rates that are faster or slower than expected, it results in prepayments that are faster or slower than expected on our investments. These faster or slower than expected payments may adversely affect our profitability.\nWe may purchase securities that have a higher interest rate than the then-prevailing market interest rate. In exchange for this higher interest rate, we may pay a premium to par value to acquire such securities. In accordance with GAAP, we amortize this premium as a reduction to interest income under the contractual interest method so that a proportional amount of the unamortized premium is amortized as principal prepayments occur. If a security is prepaid in whole or in part at a faster rate than originally expected, we will amortize the purchased premium at a faster pace resulting in a lower effective return on our investment than originally expected.\nWe also may purchase securities that have a lower interest rate than the then-prevailing market interest rate. In exchange for this lower interest rate, we may pay a discount to par value to acquire such securities. In accordance with GAAP, we accrete this discount as an increase to interest income under the contractual interest method so that a proportional amount of the unamortized discount is accreted as principal prepayments occur. If a security is prepaid in whole or in part at a slower rate than originally expected, we will accrete the purchased discount at a slower pace resulting in a lower effective return on our investment than originally expected.\nMoreover, if prepayment rates decrease due to a rising interest rate environment, the average life or duration of our fixed-rate assets will generally be extended. This could have a negative impact on our results from operations, as the maturities of our interest rate hedges are fixed and will, therefore, cover a smaller percentage of our funding exposure on our MBS assets to the extent that the average lives of the mortgages underlying such MBS increase due to slower prepayments.\nPrepayments also significantly affect the value of MSRs. An MSR entitles the holder to receive a servicing fee equal to a percentage of the unpaid principal balance of the mortgage loans with the value of an MSR based on expected future cash flows expected to be received from servicing the loans including expected future servicing fees. To the extent the underlying mortgage loan principal balances are prepaid or expected to be prepaid at a faster rate, the expected future cash flows from servicing would be expected to be lower and the value of the MSR would be expected to decline. The value of our MSR financing receivables are based on the value of a related MSR. Accordingly, an increase in prepayments can result in a reduction in the value and income we may earn of our MSR financing receivables and negatively affect our profitability.\nHomeowners tend to prepay mortgage loans more quickly when interest rates decline. Although prepayment rates generally increase when interest rates fall and decrease when interest rates rise, changes in prepayment rates are difficult to predict. Prepayments may also occur as the result of an improvement in the borrower\u2019s ability to refinance the loan as a result of home price appreciation or wage growth. Prepayments can also occur when borrowers sell the property and use the sale proceeds to prepay the mortgage as part\nof a physical relocation or when borrowers default on their mortgages and the mortgages are prepaid from the proceeds of a foreclosure sale of the property. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will generally, among other conditions, purchase mortgages that are 120 days or more delinquent from holders of such mortgages when the cost of guarantee payments to such holders, including advances of interest at the loan coupon rate, exceeds the cost of holding the nonperforming loans in their portfolios. Consequently, prepayment rates also may be affected by conditions in the housing and financial markets, which may result in increased delinquencies on mortgage loans, the GSEs\u2019 cost of capital, general economic conditions and the relative interest rates on fixed and adjustable rate loans, which could lead to an acceleration of the payment of the related principal. Furthermore, changes in the GSEs\u2019 policies regarding the repurchase of delinquent loans can materially impact prepayment rates. In addition, the introduction of new government programs could increase the availability of mortgage credit to a large number of homeowners in the United States, which could impact the prepayment rates for the entire residential mortgage MBS market. Any new programs or changes to existing programs could cause substantial uncertainty around the magnitude of changes in prepayment speeds.\nFaster or slower than expected prepayments may adversely affect our profitability and cash available for distribution to our shareholders and are difficult to predict.\nMarket conditions may disrupt the historical relationship between interest rate changes and prepayment trends, which would make it more difficult for us to analyze our investment portfolio.\nOur success depends on our ability to analyze the relationship of changing interest rates on prepayments of the mortgage loans that underlie our agency MBS and our MSR related investments. Changes in interest rates and prepayments affect the market price of agency MBS and MSR related investments that we intend to purchase and any MBS or MSR related investments that we hold at a given time. As part of our overall portfolio risk management, we analyze interest rate changes and prepayment trends separately and collectively to assess their effects on our investment portfolio. In conducting our analysis, we depend on certain assumptions based upon historical trends with respect to the relationship between interest rates and prepayments under normal market conditions. Dislocations in the residential mortgage market and other developments may change the way that prepayment trends have historically responded to interest rate changes and, consequently, may negatively impact our ability to (i) assess the impact of future changes in interest rates and prepayments on the market value of our investment portfolio, (ii) implement our hedging strategies, and (iii) implement techniques to reduce our prepayment rate volatility would be significantly affected. If we are unable to accurately forecast interest and prepayment rates, our financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nIt may be uneconomical to \u201croll\u201d our TBA dollar roll transactions or we may be unable to meet margin calls on our TBA commitments, which could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may utilize TBA dollar roll transactions as a means of investing in and financing agency MBS. TBA contracts enable us to purchase or sell, for future delivery, agency MBS with certain principal and interest terms and certain types of collateral, but the particular agency MBS to be delivered are not identified until shortly before the TBA settlement date. Prior to settlement of the TBA commitment, we may choose to move the settlement of the securities out to a later date by entering into an offsetting position (referred to as a \u201cpair off\u201d), net settling the paired off positions for cash, and simultaneously purchasing a similar TBA for a later settlement date, collectively referred to as a \u201cdollar roll.\u201d The agency MBS purchased for a forward settlement date under the TBA commitment are typically priced at a discount to agency MBS for settlement in the current month. This difference (or discount) is referred to as the \u201cprice drop.\u201d As discussed under Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations- \u201cNon-GAAP Core Operating Income,\u201d we believe this price drop is the economic equivalent of net interest carry income on the underlying agency MBS over the roll period (interest income less implied financing cost), which is commonly referred to as \u201cdollar roll income.\u201d Consequently, dollar roll transactions and such forward purchases of agency MBS represent a form of off-balance sheet financing.\nUnder certain market conditions, TBA dollar roll transactions may result in negative carry income whereby the agency MBS purchased for a forward settlement date under the TBA commitment are priced at a premium to agency MBS for settlement in the current month. Under such conditions, it may be uneconomical to roll our TBA positions prior to the settlement date and we could have to take physical delivery of the underlying securities and settle our obligations for cash. We may not have sufficient funds or alternative financing sources available to settle such obligations.\nIn addition, our TBA commitments are subject to master securities forward transaction agreements published by SIFMA as well as supplemental terms and conditions with each counterparty. Under the terms of these agreements, we may be required to pledge collateral to our counterparty in the event the fair value of our agency MBS commitments decline and such counterparty demands collateral through a margin call.\nNegative carry income on TBA dollar roll transactions or failure to procure adequate financing to settle our obligations or meet margin calls under our TBA commitments could result in defaults or force us to sell assets under adverse market conditions or through foreclosure and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur use of repurchase agreements may give our lenders greater rights in the event that either we or any of our lenders file for bankruptcy, which may make it difficult for us to recover our collateral.\nOur borrowings under repurchase agreements may qualify for special treatment under the bankruptcy code, giving our lenders the ability to avoid the automatic stay provisions of the bankruptcy code and take possession of and liquidate our collateral under the repurchase agreements without delay if we file for bankruptcy. Furthermore, the special treatment of repurchase agreements under the bankruptcy code may make it difficult for us to recover our pledged assets in the event that any of our lenders file for bankruptcy. Thus, the use of repurchase agreements exposes our pledged assets to risk in the event of a bankruptcy filing by either our lenders or us. In addition, if the lender is a broker or dealer subject to the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 or an insured depository institution subject to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, our ability to exercise our rights to recover our investment under a repurchase agreement or to be compensated for any damages resulting from the lender\u2019s insolvency may be further limited by those statutes.\nIf the lending institution under one or more of our repurchase agreements defaults on its obligation to resell the underlying security back to us at the end of the agreement term, we will lose money on our repurchase transactions.\nWhen we engage in a repurchase transaction, we initially sell securities to a counterparty under a master repurchase agreement in exchange for cash from the counterparty. The counterparty is obligated to resell the same securities back to us at the end of the term of the repurchase agreement, which typically is 30 to 60 days, but may have terms from one day to up to one year or more. The cash we receive when we initially sell the collateral is less than the value of the collateral, which is referred to as the \u201chaircut.\u201d If the counterparty in a repurchase transaction defaults on its obligation to resell the securities back to us, we will incur a loss on the transaction equal to the amount of the haircut (assuming no change in the value of the securities). Losses incurred on our repurchase transactions would adversely affect our operating results and the market price of our securities.\nIf we default on our obligations under our repurchase agreements, we may be unable to establish a suitable replacement facility on acceptable terms or at all.\nIf we default on one of our obligations under a repurchase agreement, the counterparty may terminate the agreement and cease entering into any other repurchase agreements with us. In that case, we would likely need to establish a replacement repurchase facility with another financial institution in order to continue to leverage the assets in our investment portfolio and to carry out our investment strategy. We may be unable to establish a suitable replacement repurchase facility on acceptable terms or at all.\nDespite current indebtedness levels, we may still be able to incur substantially more debt, which could have important consequences to you.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had total unsecured indebtedness (excluding payables, derivative liabilities, repurchase agreement financing and long-term secured indebtedness) of $87.7 million, which includes $34.9 million in principal amount of our 6.75% Senior Notes due 2025 (the \u201cSenior Notes due 2025\u201d), $37.8 million in principal amount of our 6.00% Senior Notes due 2026 (the \u201cSenior Notes due 2026\u201d and, collectively with the Senior Notes due 2025, the \u201cSenior Notes\u201d) and $15.0 million in principal amount of subordinated unsecured long-term debentures due between 2033 and 2035. Our level of indebtedness could have important consequences to you, because:\n\u2022\nit could affect our ability to satisfy our financial obligations;\n\u2022\na substantial portion of our cash flows from operations will have to be dedicated to interest and principal payments and may not be available for operations, expansion, acquisitions or general corporate or other purposes;\n\u2022\nit may impair our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing in the future;\n\u2022\nit may limit our ability to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity;\n\u2022\nit may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry;\n\u2022\nit may make it more difficult to meet REIT distribution requirements; and\n\u2022\nit may make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business, our industry or the economy in general.\nOur operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to service our debt. If we fail to make payment on the Senior Notes, we could default on the Senior Notes.\nThe elimination of LIBOR may affect our financial results.\nWe are party to financial instruments including interest rate swap agreements and the issuance of trust preferred debt and preferred stock that are based on LIBOR. On March 5, 2021, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d) which regulates LIBOR, announced that all LIBOR tenors relevant to us will cease to be published or will no longer be representative after June 30, 2023. The\nFCA's announcement coincides with the March 5, 2021, announcement of LIBOR's administrator, the ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (\u201cIBA\u201d) indicating that, as a result of not having access to input data necessary to calculate LIBOR tenors relevant to us on a representative basis after June 30, 2023, IBA would have to cease publication of such LIBOR tenors immediately after the last publication on June 30, 2023. These announcements mean that any of our LIBOR-based borrowings that extend beyond June 30, 2023 will need to be converted to a replacement rate.\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York jointly convened the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d), a steering committee comprised of private sector entities, each with an important presence in markets effected by LIBOR, and official-sector entities, including banking and financial sector regulators. The ARCC\u2019s initial objectives were to identify risk-free alternative reference rates for U.S. dollar (\u201cUSD\u201d) LIBOR, identify best practices for contract robustness and create an implementation plan. The ARRC has recommended SOFR, plus a recommended spread adjustment, as LIBOR\u2019s replacement.\nOn April 6, 2021, the state of New York enacted legislation (the \u201cNew York LIBOR Legislation\u201d) addressing the phase-out of LIBOR as a benchmark rate in financial instruments governed by New York law. The New York LIBOR Legislation generally tracks the legislation proposed by the ARRC and provides a statutory remedy for contracts that reference USD LIBOR as a benchmark interest rate but do not include effective fallback provisions in the event USD LIBOR is no longer published or is no longer representative. Under the New York LIBOR Legislation, if a contract governed by New York law that references USD LIBOR as a benchmark interest rate either does not contain benchmark fallback provisions or contains benchmark fallback provisions that would cause the benchmark rate to fall back to a rate that would continue to be based on USD LIBOR, then the fallback rate would be SOFR plus any applicable spread adjustment and any conforming changes selected or recommended by the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or by the ARRC. The New York LIBOR Legislation also establishes a safe harbor from liability for the selection and use of the recommended benchmark interest rate.\nThese announcements mean that any of our LIBOR-based borrowings that extend beyond June 30, 2023 will need to be converted to a replacement rate. The likely market transition away from LIBOR and towards SOFR is expected to be gradual and complicated. There are significant differences between LIBOR and SOFR, such as LIBOR being an unsecured lending rate while SOFR is a secured lending rate, and SOFR is an overnight rate while LIBOR reflects term rates at different maturities. If our LIBOR-based borrowings are converted to SOFR, the differences between LIBOR and SOFR, plus the recommended spread adjustment, could result in interest costs that are higher than if LIBOR remained available, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Although SOFR is the ARRC's recommended replacement rate, it is also possible that lenders may instead choose alternative replacement rates that may differ from LIBOR in ways similar to SOFR or in other ways that would result in higher interest costs for us. Furthermore, lenders may select alternative rates sooner than June 30, 2023, either in amendments to existing facilities or as we decide to enter into new facilities. It is possible that not all of our assets and liabilities will transition away from LIBOR at the same time, and it is possible that not all of our assets and liabilities will transition to the same alternative reference rate, in each case increasing the difficulty of hedging. We and other market participants have less experience understanding and modeling SOFR-based assets and liabilities than LIBOR-based assets and liabilities, increasing the difficulty of investing, hedging, and risk management. The process of transition involves operational risks. It is not yet possible to predict the magnitude of LIBOR's end on our borrowing costs and other operations given the remaining uncertainty about which rates will replace LIBOR and the related timing.\nWe are party to various financial instruments which include LIBOR as a reference rate that mature or expire after June 30, 2023. As of December 31, 2021, these financial instruments include interest rate swap agreements and preferred stock and unsecured notes issued by us.\nAt this time, it is not possible to predict the effect of any such changes, any establishment of alternative reference rates or any other reforms to LIBOR that may be implemented in the U.K. or elsewhere. While we expect one- and three-month LIBOR to be available in substantially its current form through June 2023, if sufficient banks decline to make submissions to IBA, it is possible that these LIBOR tenors will become unavailable prior to that point. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential changes, alternative reference rates or other reforms may adversely affect the market for, or value of, any securities, loans, derivatives and other financial obligations on which the interest or dividend is determined by reference to LIBOR, which could negatively impact our overall financial condition or results of operations. More generally, any of the above changes or any other consequential changes to LIBOR or any other \u201cbenchmark\u201d as a result of international, national or other proposals for reform or other initiatives or investigations, or any further uncertainty in relation to the timing and manner of implementation of such changes, could have a material adverse effect on the value of and return on any securities based on or linked to a \u201cbenchmark.\u201d\nOur fixed-to-floating preferred shares may also be impacted by USD-LIBOR cessation, although the nature and extent of such impact is currently uncertain, particularly in light of various potential federal and state legislative and regulatory actions designed to alleviate uncertainties related to such instruments. We do not currently intend to amend any classes of our fixed-to-floating preferred shares to change the existing USD-LIBOR cessation fallbacks. Each such class that is currently outstanding becomes callable at the same time it begins to pay a USD-LIBOR-based rate. We are not required to call any class of our fixed-to-floating preferred shares in connection with USD-LIBOR cessation. However, should we choose to call a class of preferred shares in order to avoid a dispute over the results of the USD-LIBOR fallbacks for that class, we may be forced to raise additional funds at an unfavorable time.\nLimitations on our access to capital could impair our liquidity and our ability to conduct our business.\nLiquidity, or ready access to funds, is essential to our business. Failures of similar businesses have often been attributable in large part to insufficient liquidity. Liquidity is of particular importance to our business and perceived liquidity issues may affect our counterparties\u2019 willingness to engage in transactions with us. Our liquidity could be impaired due to circumstances that we may be unable to control, such as a general market disruption, including disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the payment of significant legal defense and indemnification costs, expenses, damages or settlement amounts, or an operational problem that affects us or third parties. Further, our ability to sell assets may be impaired if other market participants are seeking to sell similar assets at the same time or the market is experiencing significant volatility. Our inability to maintain adequate liquidity would materially harm our business and operations.\nOur due diligence of potential investments may not reveal all of the liabilities associated with those investments and may not reveal aspects of the investments which could lead to lower expected investment returns or investment losses.\nBefore making certain investments, we may undertake due diligence efforts with respect to various aspects of the acquisition, including investigating the strengths and weaknesses of the originator or issuer of the asset and verifying certain aspects of the underlying securities, loans or properties themselves as well as other factors and characteristics that may be material to the performance of the investment. In making the assessment and otherwise conducting due diligence, we rely on resources available to us and, in some cases, third party information. There can be no assurance that any due diligence process that we conduct will uncover relevant facts that could be determinative of whether or not an investment will be successful.\nOur credit investments subject us to a potential high risk of loss.\nInvestments in mortgage-related assets where repayment of principal and interest is not guaranteed by a U.S. government agency or GSE subject us to the potential risk of loss of principal and/or interest due to delinquency, foreclosure and related losses of on the underlying mortgage loans.\nResidential mortgage loans underlying non-agency residential MBS are secured by residential property and are subject to risks of delinquency, foreclosure and loss. The ability of a borrower to repay a loan secured by residential property is dependent upon the income or assets of the borrower. A number of factors may impair a borrower's ability to repay the loan, including: loss of employment; divorce; illness; acts of God; acts of war or terrorism; adverse changes in national and local economic and market conditions; changes in laws and regulations, fiscal policies and zoning ordinances and the related costs of complying with such laws and regulations, fiscal policies and ordinances; costs of remediation and liabilities associated with environmental conditions such as mold; and the potential for uninsured or under-insured property losses.\nBusiness purpose residential mortgage loans are loans to professional real estate investors secured by non-owner occupied residential property that are also subject to risks of delinquency, foreclosure and loss. The properties that secure these mortgage loans often require construction, repair, or rehabilitation and are not income producing. The repayment of the mortgage loans is often largely based on the ability of the borrower to sell the mortgaged property or to convert the property for rental purposes and obtain refinancing in the form of a longer-term loan. The risks of delinquency and foreclosure on these residential properties may be greater than similar risks associated with loans made on the security of single-family, owner-occupied, residential property. The borrower\u2019s ability to repay our mortgage loans will depend, to a great extent, on the borrower\u2019s ability to complete the construction, repair or rehabilitation of the property in a timely and cost efficient manner as well as the value of the property at the maturity date of the loan. In the event of any default under a mortgage loan held by us, we will bear a risk of loss to the extent of any deficiency between the value of the collateral and the outstanding principal and accrued interest of the mortgage loan, and any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow from operations and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders.\nCommercial mortgage loans are secured by commercial property and are subject to risks of delinquency and foreclosure, and risks of loss that are greater than similar risks associated with loans made on the security of residential property. The ability of a borrower to repay a loan secured by an income-producing property typically is dependent primarily upon the successful operation of such property rather than upon the existence of independent income or assets of the borrower. If the net operating income of the property is reduced, the borrower's ability to repay the loan may be impaired. Net operating income of an income producing property can be affected by, among other things: tenant mix; success of tenant businesses; property management decisions; property location and condition; competition from comparable types of properties; changes in laws that increase operating expense or limit rents that may be charged; any need to address environmental contamination at the property; the occurrence of any uninsured casualty at the property; changes in national, regional or local economic conditions or specific industry segments; declines in regional or local real estate values; declines in regional or local rental or occupancy rates; increases in interest rates; real estate tax rates and other operating expenses; changes in governmental rules, regulations and fiscal policies, including environmental legislation; acts of God, acts of war or terrorism, a pandemic, social unrest and civil disturbances. These risks may be more pronounced during times of market volatility and negative economic conditions, such as those being experienced in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe depend on third-party service providers, including mortgage servicers, for a variety of services related to our non-agency MBS, mortgage loan investments, MSR related assets and SFR investments. We are, therefore, subject to the risks associated with third-party service providers.\nWe depend on a variety of third-party service providers related to our non-agency MBS, mortgage loan investments and MSR related assets. We rely on the mortgage servicers who service the mortgage loans backing our non-agency MBS to, among other things, collect principal and interest payments on the underlying mortgages and perform loss mitigation services. We also rely on administrative agents who service the mortgage loans that we may directly invest in. Mortgage servicers and other service providers to our MBS, such as trustees, bond insurance providers and custodians, may not perform in a manner that promotes our interests.\nOur MSR related assets are dependent upon the mortgage servicer counterparty performing the actual servicing of the mortgage loans. The duties and obligations of the mortgage servicer are defined through contractual agreements, which generally provide for the possibility of termination of the mortgage servicer in the absolute discretion of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Our MSR related assets could also be materially and adversely affected if the mortgage servicer is unable to service the underlying mortgage loans due to a failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, failure to perform its loss mitigation duties, a downgrade in its servicer rating, the failure to perform adequately in its external audits, or a failure in or performance of its operational systems or infrastructure. We are reliant on a third-party investment firm to identify, acquire and manage investments in SFR properties on our behalf. Our SFR investments could be materially and adversely affected if our relationship with this third-party investment firm were to end. See \u201cRisks Related to our Investing and Financing Activities - We are exposed to certain risks related to our investments in SFR homes\u201d for information on our SFR investments.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic disruption it has caused may result in liquidity pressures on servicers and other third-party vendors that we rely upon. For instance, as a result of an increase in mortgagors requesting relief in the form of forbearance plans and/or other loss mitigation, servicers and other parties responsible in capital markets securitization transactions for funding advances with respect to delinquent mortgagor payments of principal and interest may begin to experience financial difficulties if mortgagors do not make monthly payments as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The negative impact on the business and operations of such servicers or other parties responsible for funding such advances could be significant\nThe failure of servicers to effectively service the mortgage loans underlying the non-agency MBS in our investment portfolio could materially and adversely affect us.\nMost securitizations of mortgage loans require a servicer to manage collections on each of the underlying loans. Both default frequency and default severity of loans may depend upon the quality of the servicer. If servicers are not vigilant in encouraging borrowers to make their monthly payments, the borrowers may be far less likely to make these payments, which could result in a higher frequency of default. If servicers take longer to liquidate non-performing assets, loss severities may tend to be higher than originally anticipated. Additionally, servicers can perform loan modifications, which could potentially impact the value of our securities. The failure of servicers to effectively service the mortgage loans underlying the non-agency MBS in our investment portfolio could negatively impact the value of our investments and our performance. Servicer quality is of prime importance in the default performance of non-agency MBS. If a servicer goes out of business, the transfer of servicing takes time and loans may become delinquent because of confusion or lack of attention. When servicing is transferred, previously advanced principal and interest is often recaptured rapidly by the new servicer, which may have an adverse effect on non-agency MBS credit support. In the case of pools of securitized loans, servicers may be required to advance interest on delinquent loans to the extent the servicer deems those advances recoverable. In the event the servicer does not advance funds, interest may be interrupted, even on more senior securities. Servicers may also advance more than is in fact recoverable once a defaulted loan is disposed, and the loss to the trust may be greater than the outstanding principal balance of that loan (greater than 100% loss severity).\nOur investment portfolio may be concentrated in terms of credit risk.\nOur investment portfolio may at times be concentrated in certain property types that are subject to higher risk of foreclosure, or secured by properties concentrated in a limited number of geographic locations. To the extent that our portfolio is concentrated in any one region or type of asset, downturns relating generally to such region or type of asset may result in defaults on a number of our assets within a short time period, which may reduce our net income and the value of our shares and accordingly reduce our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. Our portfolio may contain other concentrations of risk, and we may fail to identify, detect or hedge against those risks, resulting in large or unexpected losses. This risk may be more pronounced during times of market volatility and negative economic conditions, such as those being experienced in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur investments may include subordinated tranches of non-agency MBS, which are subordinate in right of payment to more senior securities.\nOur investments may include subordinated tranches of non-agency MBS, which are subordinated classes of securities in a structure collateralized by a pool of mortgage loans and, accordingly, are among the first to bear the loss upon a restructuring or\nliquidation of the underlying collateral and the last to receive payment of interest and principal. Additionally, estimated fair values of these subordinated interests tend to be more sensitive to changes in economic conditions than more senior securities. As a result, such subordinated interests generally are less actively traded and may not provide holders thereof with liquid investments. When we invest in securities that are illiquid, are unrated, have a higher risk of default or are difficult to value, such securities may be considered speculative, and their capacity to pay principal and interest in accordance with the terms of their issue is not certain.\nOur mortgage loan investments secured by healthcare properties exposes us to additional risk of loss.\nWe have a mortgage loan investment that is secured by the real property of healthcare facilities and guaranteed by the operator of the facilities. The revenues of the operators are primarily driven by occupancy, private pay rates and Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements. Expenses of these facilities are primarily driven by the costs of labor, food, utilities, taxes, insurance and rent. To the extent that any decrease in revenue or increase in operating expenses result in the facilities not generating enough cash to make payments to us, including decreases in revenue or increases in operating expenses related to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, we would have to rely on the creditworthiness of the guarantor and the value of the collateral. To the extent the value of the property is reduced, we may need to reduce the fair value of our mortgage loan investment and we could incur a realized loss upon the disposition of the investment.\nThe healthcare industry is highly competitive. The operators of the facilities securing our mortgage loan investments compete on a local and regional basis with other properties and healthcare providers that provide comparable services. We cannot be certain that the operators of the facilities securing our investments will be able to achieve and maintain occupancy levels and rates that will enable them to meet our borrower\u2019s obligations to us.\nThe operators and healthcare facilities securing our investments may also face litigation and may experience rising liability and insurance costs. Litigation brought by individual patients and advocacy groups against operators of facilities can result in large damage awards of alleged abuses and may result in material increases in the costs incurred by operators, including increases to their costs of liability and medical malpractice insurance.\nThe operators and healthcare facilities are also subject to varying levels of federal, state, local and industry-regulated licensures, certification and inspection laws, regulations and standards. The failure to comply with any of these laws, regulations, or standards could result in loss of accreditation, denial of reimbursements, imposition of fines, suspension, decertification or exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs, loss of licensure or closure of the facility. The operators and healthcare facilities rely on reimbursement from third-party payors, including Medicare and Medicaid programs, for their revenues. Changes in the reimbursement rates or methods of payment of insurance companies and Medicare and Medicaid programs could have a material adverse effect on the operators and healthcare facilities securing our mortgage loan investment.\nOur investments in MSR related assets expose us to additional risk of loss if our counterparty were unable satisfy its obligation to us.\nWe have investments in MSR related assets that expose us to additional risk of loss. We do not hold the requisite licenses to purchase or hold MSRs directly. However, we have entered into agreements with a licensed, GSE approved residential mortgage loan servicer that enable us to garner the economic return of an investment in an MSR purchased by the mortgage servicing counterparty through an MSR financing transaction. Under the terms of the arrangement, for an MSR acquired by the mortgage servicing counterparty (i) we purchase the \u201cexcess servicing spread\u201d from the mortgage servicer counterparty, entitling us to monthly distributions of the servicing fees collected by the mortgage servicing counterparty in excess of 12.5 basis points per annum (and to distributions of corresponding proceeds of sale of the MSRs), and (ii) we fund the balance of the MSR purchase price to the parent company of the mortgage servicing counterparty (the \u201cbasic fee\u201d) and, in exchange, have an unsecured right to payment of certain amounts determined by reference to the MSR, generally equal to the servicing fee revenue less the excess servicing spread and the costs of servicing (and to distributions of corresponding proceeds of sale of the MSRs), net of fees earned by the mortgage servicing counterparty and its affiliates including an incentive fee. Under GAAP, we account for transactions executed under this arrangement as financing transactions and reflect the associated financing receivables in the line item \u201cMSR financing receivables\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets.\nThe counterparty to our agreements has the approvals from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the requisite state licenses to hold and manage MSRs. While we are the owner of the \u201cexcess servicing spread\u201d of the MSR, the mortgage servicing counterparty is the legal owner of the MSR and our right to receive proceeds on our MSR financing receivable from the basic fee component part of the transaction is an unsecured obligation of the mortgage servicing counterparty. If the counterparty were to default under its obligation to return any of the proceeds from the MSR financing receivable to us, we could realize a loss on our mortgage servicing related asset that could adversely affect our financial conditional and results of operations.\nThe underlying mortgage loans related to the MSRs the counterparty purchases are subject and subordinate in all respects to the interests of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which includes the right of the applicable agency to terminate the mortgage servicing counterparty with or without cause, the right to sell, retain or have transferred the related MSRs, and the right to direct the sale or\ntransfer process of the related MSRs. A default by the mortgage servicing counterparty in its capacity as servicer relating to its obligations under any acknowledge agreement with an agency, pooling and servicing agreement, agency requirements and/or failure of the servicer to perform its obligations related to any MSR could result in a loss of value of our excess servicing spread of the MSR and a loss in value of our MSR financing receivable that references the MSR. In addition to being subject to regulations by the related agency, mortgage servicers are also subject to extensive federal, state and local laws, regulations and administrative decisions that failure to comply with expose the servicer to fines, damages and losses. In its capacity as servicer, the mortgage servicing counterparty also operates in a highly litigious industry that subject it to potential lawsuits related to billing and collections practices, modification protocols or foreclosure practices. If the MSRs that are referenced to our contractual arrangements are terminated or transferred or if our counterparty incurred significant losses, such mortgage servicing counterparty to our MSR financing receivables may not be able to satisfy its obligation to us which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur investments in MSR related assets may expose us to additional risk of leverage that could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nPursuant to our MSR financing receivables, we are entitled to an unsecured right of payment determined by reference to a pool of specific MSRs owned by the mortgage servicing counterparty. At our election and direction, the mortgage servicing counterparty could utilize leverage on the MSRs that are subject to our MSR financing receivables to finance the purchase of additional MSRs to increase potential returns to us. The lender providing the leverage to our mortgage servicing counterparty would have a secured interest in the MSRs pledged under a credit facility between the lender and our mortgage servicing counterparty. Under the credit facility, if the fair value of the pledged MSR collateral declines and the lender demands additional collateral from our mortgage servicing counterparty through a margin call, we would be required to provide the mortgage servicing counterparty with additional funds to meet such margin call. If we were unable to satisfy such margin call, the lender could liquidate the MSR collateral position that are referenced to our MSR financing receivable to satisfy the loan obligation which would adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nOur mortgage servicing counterparty may also pledge MSRs subject to other similar MSR financing receivable relationships with other third parties as collateral under the same credit facility that have a pledge of the MSRs referenced to our MSR financing receivable. If such third party to another MSR financing receivable were unable to satisfy a margin call on its referenced pool of MSRs and the value of such MSRs were insufficient to satisfy the corresponding debt obligation to the lender, the lender would have recourse to the MSRs referenced to our MSR financing receivable. In such case, if the mortgage servicing counterparty to our MSR financing receivable fails to satisfy such third party\u2019s shortfall, the lender could liquidate the MSRs referenced to our MSR financing receivable if we did not fund such remaining margin deficiency. As a result of this cross collateralization of our mortgage servicing counterparty\u2019s credit facility, the value of our MSR financing receivables may be adversely impacted by the inability of our mortgage servicing counterparty\u2019s other contracted parties to meet their margin calls which could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nWe may have to fund servicing advances under our MSR related assets that could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.\nAn owner of an MSR is obligated to fund servicing advances for the payment of principal and interest due to the third-party owners of the loans, property taxes and insurance premiums, legal expenses and other protective advances that have not yet been received from the individual borrowers. Under the arrangements of our MSR financing receivables, we are required to fund to the mortgage servicing counterparty any servicing advances that it is required to fund as the owner of the referenced MSR. These advances may be subject to delays in recovery and may not be recoverable under certain circumstances. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a greater possibility that mortgage loan borrowers could request forbearance of their monthly mortgage payments. In addition, agencies and other federal and state regulators may require servicers to grant forbearance under these circumstances. If a borrower is granted forbearance, the owner of the MSR would be required to fund the servicing advances. If we had to fund servicing advances under our mortgage servicing related assets, our liquidity and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe are exposed to certain risks related to our investments in SFR homes.\nOur investments in SFR homes expose us to certain risks (including risks that differ from the risks associated with the other assets included in our investment portfolio), including among others:\n\u2022\nAbility to identify attractive tenants. Our success depends, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain qualified tenants. This will depend, in turn, upon our ability, through a third-party investment firm, to screen applicants, identify good residents, avoid tenants who may default, and the willingness of our tenants to renew their leases. When properties are vacant, we are not earning rental income and incur maintenance costs as well as turnover costs associated with re-leasing the properties, such as marketing and leasing commissions. Additionally, if we have to evict tenants, we will incur legal costs and may have renovation costs if the tenants don\u2019t properly maintain the properties or cause damage to the properties.\n\u2022\nAssumptions regarding, and conditions in, our targeted markets. The success of our SFR strategy will depend upon many factors including, but not limited to: the availability of properties that meet our investment criteria and our ability to acquire such properties at favorable prices; our ability to avoid overpaying for properties and avoid impairment charges on such assets; real estate appreciation or depreciation in our target markets; the condition of our properties; our ability to contain renovation, maintenance, marketing and other operating costs for our properties; our ability to maintain high occupancy rates and target rent levels; general economic conditions in our target markets, such as changes in employment and household earnings and expenses; the effects of rent controls, stabilization laws and other laws or regulations regarding rental rates and tenant rights; and changes in, and changes in enforcement of, laws, regulations and government policies including health, safety, environmental, property, zoning and tax laws.\n\u2022\nSignificant competition. There is significant competition for SFR homes. Within the past several years, several entities have entered the SFR market and attempted to acquire and operate SFR properties on a large-scale basis and to achieve attractive yields employing technology through a disciplined approach to acquisitions and leasing, marketing and management. Many of our competitors may be larger and have greater financial, technical, leasing, marketing and other resources than we do, which may affect our ability to acquire our target properties at attractive prices and attract quality tenants.\nThese conditions and risks, if experienced by us, could have a material adverse impact on our ability to successfully execute our SFR investment strategy.\nOur investments in SFR homes may be comprised of a significant number of properties in certain geographic markets, which may expose us to significant risks if there is economic distress in our largest markets or in the SFR sector.\nOur investments in SFR homes may be concentrated in certain geographic areas based on the availability of properties that meet our investment criteria. In addition, our strategy involves certain target markets that we believe favor future growth in potential returns valuations. A downturn or slowdown in the rental demand for SFR homes generally, or in certain specific geographic markets, caused by adverse economic, regulatory or environmental conditions, or other events, would have a greater impact on our operating results than if we had more diversified investments.\nOur long-term growth will depend significantly upon future acquisitions of SFRs that meet our acquisition criteria.\nThe acquisition of SFRs (which is a central element of our growth strategy) entails various risks, including the risks that we may overvalue a home or portfolio of homes, our SFRs may not perform as we expect, our tenants may default and our cost estimates for restoring an acquired home may prove inaccurate, and we may be unable to quickly and efficiently renew leases of our acquired homes upon their expiration. If any of these should occur, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, we cannot assure you of the continued availability of acquisition opportunities in our markets at attractive pricing levels. If such opportunities are not available, our revenue and growth potential may be adversely affected.\nAcquiring properties during periods when the SFR sector is experiencing substantial inflows of capital and intense competition may result in inflated purchase prices and increase the likelihood that our SFR homes will not appreciate in value and may, instead, decrease in value.\nThe allocation of substantial amounts of capital for investment in the SFR sector and significant competition for income producing real estate may inflate the purchase prices for such assets. To the extent we purchased, or in the future purchase, SFR homes in such an environment, it is possible that the value of these properties may not appreciate and may, instead, decrease in value, perhaps significantly, below the amount we paid for such properties. In addition to macroeconomic and local economic factors, technical factors, such as a decrease in the amount of capital allocated to the SFR sector and the number of investors participating in the sector, could cause the value of our properties to decline.\nTenant relief laws, including laws regulating evictions, rent control laws, and other regulations that limit our ability to collect rent or increase rental rates may negatively impact our SFR investments.\nEviction activities impose legal and managerial expenses that may increase our expenses related to our SFR investments. The eviction process is typically subject to legal barriers, mandatory \u201ccure\u201d policies, our internal policies and procedures, and other sources of expense and delay, each of which may delay our ability to gain possession and stabilize the property. Additionally, state and local landlord-tenant laws may impose legal duties to assist residents in relocating to new housing or restrict the landlord\u2019s ability to remove the resident on a timely basis or to recover certain costs or charge residents for damage residents cause to the landlord\u2019s premises. Because such laws vary by state and locality, we must be familiar with and take all appropriate steps to comply with all applicable landlord-tenant laws and need to incur supervisory and legal expenses to ensure such compliance. To the extent that we do not comply with state or local laws, we may be subjected to civil litigation filed by individuals, in class actions or actions by state or\nlocal law enforcement and our reputation and financial results may suffer. We may be required to pay our adversaries\u2019 litigation fees and expenses if judgment is entered against us in such litigation or if we settle such litigation.\nFurthermore, state and local governmental agencies may introduce rent control laws or other regulations that limit our ability to increase rental rates, which may affect our rental income. Especially in times of recession and economic slowdown, rent control initiatives can gain significant political support. If rent controls unexpectedly became applicable to certain of our properties, our revenue from and the value of such properties could be adversely affected.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal government as well as certain states, counties, and cities imposed various measures, including temporary eviction moratoriums, deferral of missed rent payments without incurring late fees, and restrictions on rent increases. Jurisdictions and other local and national authorities may expand or extend measures imposing restrictions on our ability to enforce residents\u2019 contractual rental obligations and limiting our ability to collect and increase rents. We cannot predict if states, municipalities, local, and/or national authorities will renew, extend, or expand existing restrictions, if additional states or municipalities will implement similar restrictions, or when restrictions currently in place will expire.\nOur investments are recorded at fair value based upon assumptions that are inherently subjective, and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if our determinations regarding the fair value of our investments are materially higher than the values that we ultimately realize upon their disposal.\nWe measure the fair value of our certain of investments quarterly, in accordance with guidance set forth in FASB Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. Ultimate realization of the value of an asset depends to a great extent on economic and other conditions that are beyond our control. Further, fair value is only an estimate based on good faith judgment of the price at which an investment can be sold because market prices of investments can only be determined by negotiation between a willing buyer and seller. If we were to liquidate a particular asset, the realized value may be more than or less than the amount at which such asset is valued. Accordingly, the value of our securities could be adversely affected by our determinations regarding the fair value of our investments, whether in the applicable period or in the future. Additionally, such valuations may fluctuate over short periods of time.\nOur determination of the fair value of our investments includes prices based on estimates provided by third-party pricing sources including pricing services and dealers. In general, these pricing sources heavily disclaim their valuations. Our credit and MSR related investments trade infrequently and may be considered illiquid. Our determination of the fair value of certain of credit and MSR related investments are based on significant unobservable inputs based on various assumptions made by our management or third-party pricing services. These significant unobservable inputs may include assumptions regarding future interest rates, prepayment rates, discount rates, costs of servicing, default rates, loss-given-default rates and the timing of credit losses. These assumptions are inherently subjective and involve a high degree of management judgment, and our determinations of fair value may differ materially from the values that would have been used if a public market for these investments existed. Depending on the complexity and liquidity of an investment, valuations of the same investment can vary substantially from one pricing service to another. Our results of operations for a given period could be adversely affected if our determinations regarding the fair market value of these investments are materially different than the values that we ultimately realize upon their disposal.\nWe operate in a highly-competitive market for investment opportunities, which could make it difficult for us to purchase or originate investments at attractive yields and thus have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe gain access to investment opportunities only to the extent that they become known to us. Gaining access to investment opportunities is highly competitive. Many of our competitors are substantially larger than us and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources, more long-standing relationships, broader product offerings and other advantages. Some of our competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us. As a result of this competition, we may not be able to purchase or originate our target investments at attractive yields, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to our Business and Structure\nOur Rights Plan could inhibit a change in our control.\nWe have a Rights Plan designed to protect against a possible limitation on our ability to use our NOLs, NCLs and built-in losses by dissuading investors from aggregating ownership of our common stock and triggering an \u201cownership change\u201d for purposes of Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the terms of the Rights Plan, in general, if a person or group acquires or commences a tender or exchange offer for beneficial ownership of 4.9% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock upon a determination by our Board of Directors (an \u201cAcquiring Person\u201d), all of our other Class A common shareholders will have the right to purchase securities from us at a discount to such securities\u2019 fair market value, thus causing substantial dilution to the Acquiring\nPerson. The Rights Plan and any outstanding rights will expire at the earliest of (i) June 4, 2022, (ii) the time at which the rights are redeemed or exchanged pursuant to the Rights Plan, (iii) the repeal of Section 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code or any successor statute if the Board of Directors determines that the Rights Plan is no longer necessary for the preservation of the applicable tax benefits, or (iv) the beginning of a taxable year to which the Board of Directors determines that no applicable tax benefits may be carried forward. Our Board of Directors and shareholders may in the future approve an amendment to extend the expiration period of the Rights Plan.\nThe Rights Plan may have the effect of inhibiting or impeding a change in control not approved by our Board of Directors and, notwithstanding its purpose, could adversely affect our shareholders\u2019 ability to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price for our common stock in connection with such a transaction. In addition, because our Board of Directors can prevent the Rights Plan from operating, in the event our Board of Directors approves of an Acquiring Person, the Rights Plan gives our Board of Directors significant discretion over whether a potential acquirer\u2019s efforts to acquire a large interest in us will be successful. Consequently, the Rights Plan could impede transactions that would otherwise benefit our shareholders.\nThe ownership limits in our charter may discourage a takeover or business combination that may have benefited our shareholders.\nTo assist us in qualifying as a REIT, among other purposes, our Articles of Incorporation generally limits, unless waived by our board of directors, the beneficial or constructive ownership of any class of our stock by any person to no more than 9.9% in value or the number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of the outstanding shares of any class or series of our stock. This and other restrictions on ownership and transfer of our shares of stock contained in our Articles of Incorporation may discourage a change of control of us and may deter individuals or entities from making tender offers for our common stock on terms that might be financially attractive to you or which may cause a change in our management. In addition to deterring potential transactions that may be favorable to our stockholders, these provisions may also decrease your ability to sell our common stock because they make purchases of our common stock less attractive.\nThe trading price of our securities may be adversely affected by factors outside of our control.\nAny negative changes in the public\u2019s perception of the prospects for our business or the types of assets in which we invest could depress our stock price regardless of our results. The following factors, among others, could contribute to the volatility of the price of our common stock, 7.00% Series B Cumulative Perpetual Redeemable Preferred Stock (\u201cSeries B Preferred Stock\u201d), 8.250% Series C Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (\u201cSeries C Preferred Stock\u201d) or Senior Notes:\n\u2022\nactual or unanticipated variations in our quarterly results;\n\u2022\nmarket dislocations related to the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\nchanges in our financial estimates by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nconditions or trends affecting companies that make investments similar to ours;\n\u2022\nchanges in interest rate environments and the mortgage market that cause our borrowing costs to increase, our reported yields on our investment portfolio to decrease or that cause the value of our investment portfolio to decrease;\n\u2022\nchanges in the residential real estate market;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market valuations of our investments;\n\u2022\nnegative changes in the public\u2019s perception of the prospects of investment or financial services companies;\n\u2022\nchanges in the regulatory environment in which our business operates or changes in federal fiscal or monetary policies;\n\u2022\ndilution resulting from new equity issuances;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions such as a recession, or interest rate or currency rate fluctuations; and\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of our key personnel.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control.\nWe have not established a minimum dividend payment level and we cannot assure you of our ability to pay dividends in the future.\nThe declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends on shares of common stock will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors.\nAs a REIT, we are required to distribute annually 90% of our REIT taxable income (subject to certain adjustments). So long as we continue to qualify as a REIT, we will generally not be subject to U.S. federal or state corporate income taxes on our taxable income that we distribute to our shareholders on a timely basis. At present, it is our intention to distribute 100% of our taxable\nincome, although we will not be required to do so. We intend to make distributions of our taxable income within the time limits prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code, which may extend into the subsequent taxable year. As of December 31, 2021, we had estimated NOL carryforwards of $165.0 million that can be used to offset future REIT taxable income and reduce our future distribution requirements. As of December 31, 2021, we also had estimated NCL carryforwards of $127.1 million that can be used to offset future net capital gains.\nWe have not established a minimum dividend payment level and the amount of future dividends, if any, may fluctuate. Our ability to pay dividends may be adversely affected by the risk factors described herein. All distributions will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors\u2019 determination to declare a dividend is based upon multiple factors, including REIT distribution requirements, current financial results, overall economic and market conditions, ongoing liquidity needs, opportunities to return capital to shareholders through accretive stock repurchases, available returns on new investments, and such other factors as our Board of Directors deems relevant from time to time. Our Board of Directors did not declare a dividend on our common stock for any quarter during 2021, and it is uncertain when our Board of Directors will determine to declare future dividends, if any, on our common stock. Accordingly, the timing and amount, if any, of future cash distributions to Class A common shareholders is uncertain which may also negatively impact the market price of our common stock.\nIndemnification obligations to certain of our current and former directors and officers may increase the costs to us of legal proceedings involving our company.\nOur charter contains a provision that limits the liability of our directors and officers to us and our shareholders for money damages, except for liability resulting from willful misconduct or a knowing violation of the criminal law or any federal or state securities law. Our charter also requires us to indemnify our directors and officers in connection with any liability incurred by them in connection with any action or proceeding (including any action by us or in our right) to which they are or may be made a party by reason of their service in those or other capacities if the conduct in question was in our best interests and the person was acting on our behalf or performing services for us, unless the person engaged in willful misconduct or a knowing violation of the criminal law. The Virginia Stock Corporation Act requires a Virginia corporation (unless its charter provides otherwise, which our charter does not) to indemnify a director or officer who has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of any proceeding to which he is made a party by reason of his service in that capacity.\nIn addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with certain of our current and former directors and officers under which we are generally required to indemnify them against liability incurred by them in connection with any action or proceeding to which they are or may be made a party by reason of their service in those or other capacities, if the conduct in question was in our best interests and the person was conducting themselves in good faith (subject to certain exceptions, including liabilities arising from willful misconduct, a knowing violation of the criminal law or receipt of an improper benefit).\nIn the future, we may be the subject of indemnification assertions under our charter, Virginia law or these indemnification agreements by our current and former directors and officers who are or may become party to any action or proceeding. We maintain directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance policies that may limit our exposure and enable us to recover a portion of any amounts paid with respect to such obligations. However, if our coverage under these policies is reduced, denied, eliminated or otherwise not available to us, our potential financial exposure would be increased. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification obligations could be significant. Amounts paid pursuant to our indemnification obligations could adversely affect our financial results and the amount of cash available for distribution to our shareholders.\nLoss of our exclusion from regulation as an investment company under the 1940 Act would adversely affect us and may reduce the market price of our securities.\nWe currently rely on Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the 1940 Act for our exclusion from the registration requirements of the 1940 Act. This provision requires that 55% of our assets, on an unconsolidated basis, consist of qualifying assets, such as agency whole pool certificates, and 80% of our assets, on an unconsolidated basis, consist of qualifying assets or real estate-related assets. We will need to ensure not only that we qualify for an exclusion or exemption from regulation under the 1940 Act, but also that each of our subsidiaries qualifies for such an exclusion or exemption. We intend to maintain our exclusion by monitoring the value of our interests in our subsidiaries. We may not be successful in this regard.\nIf we fail to maintain our exclusion and another exclusion or exemption is not available, we may be required to register as an investment company, or we may be required to acquire or dispose of assets in order to meet our exemption. Any such asset acquisitions or dispositions may include assets that we would not acquire or dispose of in the ordinary course of business, may be at unfavorable prices and result in a decline in the price of our securities. If we are required to register as an investment company under the 1940 Act, we would become subject to substantial regulation with respect to our capital structure (including our ability to use leverage), management, operations, transactions with affiliated persons (as defined in the 1940 Act), and portfolio composition, including restrictions with respect to diversification and industry concentration and other matters. Accordingly, registration under the 1940 Act could limit our ability to follow our current investment and financing strategies and result in a decline in the price of our securities.\nFailure to obtain and maintain an exemption from being regulated as a commodity pool operator could subject us to additional regulation and compliance requirements and may result in fines and other penalties which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act established a comprehensive new regulatory framework for derivative contracts commonly referred to as \u201cswaps.\u201d As a result, any investment fund that trades in swaps or other derivatives may be considered a \u201ccommodity pool,\u201d which would cause its operators (in some cases the fund\u2019s directors) to be regulated as \u201ccommodity pool operators,\u201d or CPOs. Under rules adopted by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d) for which the compliance date generally was December 31, 2012 as to those funds that become commodity pools solely because of their use of swaps, CPOs must by then have filed an application for registration with the National Futures Association (\u201cNFA\u201d) and have commenced and sustained good faith efforts to comply with the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC\u2019s regulations with respect to capital raising, disclosure, reporting, recordkeeping and other business conduct applicable for their activities as CPOs as if the CPOs were in fact registered in such capacity (which also requires compliance with applicable NFA rules). However, the CFTC\u2019s Division of Swap Dealer and Intermediary Oversight issued a no-action letter saying, although it believes that mortgage REITs are properly considered commodity pools, it would not recommend that the CFTC take enforcement action against the operator of a mortgage REIT who does not register as a CPO if, among other things, the mortgage REIT limits the initial margin and premiums required to establish its swaps, futures and other commodity interest positions to not more than five percent (5%) of its total assets, the mortgage REIT limits the net income derived annually from those commodity interest positions which are not qualifying hedging transactions to less than five percent (5%) of its gross income, and interests in the mortgage REIT are not marketed to the public as or in a commodity pool or otherwise as or in a vehicle for trading in the commodity futures, commodity options or swaps markets.\nWe use hedging instruments in conjunction with our investment portfolio and related borrowings to reduce or mitigate risks associated with changes in interest rates, yield curve shapes and market volatility. These hedging instruments may include interest rate swaps, interest rate swap futures, Eurodollar futures, U.S. Treasury note futures and options on futures. We do not currently engage in any speculative derivatives activities or other non-hedging transactions using swaps, futures or options on futures. We do not use these instruments for the purpose of trading in commodity interests, and we do not consider our company or its operations to be a commodity pool as to which CPO registration or compliance is required. We have claimed the relief afforded by the above-described no-action letter. Consequently, we will be restricted to operating within the parameters discussed in the no-action letter and will not enter into hedging transactions covered by the no-action letter if they would cause us to exceed the limits set forth in the no-action letter. However, there can be no assurance that the CFTC will agree that we are entitled to the no-action letter relief claimed.\nThe CFTC has substantial enforcement power with respect to violations of the laws over which it has jurisdiction, including their anti-fraud and anti-manipulation provisions. For example, the CFTC may suspend or revoke the registration of or the no-action relief afforded to a person who fails to comply with commodities laws and regulations, prohibit such a person from trading or doing business with registered entities, impose civil money penalties, require restitution and seek fines or imprisonment for criminal violations. In the event that the CFTC staff does not provide the no action letter relief we requested or if the CFTC otherwise determines that CPO registration and compliance is required of us, we may be obligated to furnish additional disclosures and reports, among other things. Further, a private right of action exists against those who violate the laws over which the CFTC has jurisdiction or who willfully aid, abet, counsel, induce or procure a violation of those laws. In the event that we fail to comply with statutory requirements relating to derivatives or with the CFTC\u2019s rules thereunder, including the mortgage REIT no-action letter described above, we may be subject to significant fines, penalties and other civil or governmental actions or proceedings, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face competition for personnel, which could adversely affect our business and in turn negatively affect our operating results and the market price of our securities.\nWe are dependent on the highly-skilled, and often highly-specialized, individuals we employ. Retention of specialists to manage our portfolio is particularly important to our prospects. Competition for the recruiting and retention of employees may increase elements of our compensation costs. We may not be able to recruit and hire new employees with our desired qualifications in a timely manner. Our incentives may be insufficient to recruit and retain our employees. We currently do not have employment agreements with any of our senior officers and other key professionals. We cannot guarantee that we will continue to have access to members of our senior management team or other key professionals. Increased compensation costs or failure to recruit and retain qualified employees could materially and adversely affect our operating results and the market price of our securities.\nWe are highly dependent upon communications and information systems operated by third parties, and systems failures could significantly disrupt our business, which may, in turn, negatively affect our operating results and the market price of our securities.\nOur business is highly dependent upon communications and information systems that allow us to monitor, value, buy, sell, finance and hedge our investments. Many of these systems are primarily operated by third parties and, as a result, we have limited ability to ensure their continued operation. Furthermore, in the event of systems failure or interruption, we will have limited ability to\naffect the timing and success of systems restoration. Any failure or interruption of our systems or third-party trading or information systems could cause delays or other problems in our securities trading activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and negatively affect the market price of our securities and our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nWe face risks relating to cybersecurity attacks that could cause loss of confidential information and other business disruptions.\nWe rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions and manage our business, and our business is at risk from, and may be impacted by, cybersecurity attacks. These could include attempts to gain unauthorized access to our data and computer systems. Attacks can be both individual and/or highly organized attempts by sophisticated hacking organizations. Due to the transition to remote working environments as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an elevated risk of such events occurring. We employ a number of measures to prevent, detect and mitigate these threats, which include password encryption, frequent password change events, firewall detection systems, anti-virus software and frequent backups; however, there can be no guarantee that such efforts will be successful in preventing a cybersecurity attack. A cybersecurity attack could compromise the confidential information of our employees, borrowers and vendors. A successful attack could disrupt and otherwise adversely affect our business operations and financial prospects, damage our reputation and involve significant legal and/or financial liabilities and penalties, including through lawsuits by third-parties.\nIf we issue additional debt securities or other equity securities that rank senior to our common stock, our operations may be restricted and we will be exposed to additional risk and the market price of our securities could be adversely affected.\nIf we decide to issue additional debt securities in the future, it is likely that such securities will be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility and inhibit our ability to make required distributions. Additionally, any convertible or exchangeable or other securities registered pursuant to our shelf registration statement that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our common stock. Also, additional shares of preferred stock, if issued, could have a preference on liquidating distributions or a preference on dividend payments that could limit our ability to make a dividend distribution to the holders of our common stock. We, and indirectly our shareholders, will bear the cost of issuing and servicing such securities. Holders of debt securities may be granted specific rights, including but not limited to, the right to hold a perfected security interest in certain of our assets, the right to accelerate payments due under the indenture, rights to restrict dividend payments, and rights to approve the sale of assets. Such additional restrictive covenants, operating restrictions and preferential dividends could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and negatively affect the market price of our securities and our ability to pay distributions to our shareholders.\nFuture sales of shares of our common stock may depress the price of our shares.\nWe cannot predict the effect, if any, of future sales of our common stock or the availability of shares for future sales on the market price of our common stock. Any sales of a substantial number of our shares in the public market, or the perception that sales might occur, may cause the market price of our shares to decline.\nWe may experience significant fluctuations in quarterly operating results.\nOur revenues and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and from year to year due to a combination of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the market value of the investments we acquire, the performance of our hedging instruments, prepayment rates, credit performance of our investments, current events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and changes in interest rates. As a result, we may fail to meet profitability or dividend expectations, which could negatively affect the market price of our securities and our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 has caused severe disruptions in the U.S. and global economies, and has adversely affected, and will likely continue to adversely affect our business, financial conditions, liquidity and results of operations.\nWe believe the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected our business and is likely to continue to do so. The COVID-19 outbreak has caused significant volatility and disruption in the financial markets both globally and in the United States. If COVID-19, or another highly infectious or contagious disease, continues to spread or the response to contain it is unsuccessful, we could continue to experience material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations. The extent of such effects will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the geographic spread of the virus, the overall severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, mutations and new variants of the virus, the measures that may be taken by various governmental authorities in response to the outbreak (such as quarantines and travel restrictions) and the possible further impacts on the global economy. In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic presents the following risks and uncertainties to our business:\n\u2022\nA significant decrease in economic activity and/or resulting decline in the housing market could have an adverse effect on the value of our investments in mortgages and residential real estate. Further, in light of COVID-19\u2019s impact on the overall economy, mortgage borrowers may experience difficulties meeting their obligations or seek to forbear payment on or refinance their mortgage loans to avail themselves of lower rates. Tenants of our residential homes may experience difficulties meeting their lease obligations and government eviction moratoriums may limit our ability for recourse in such instances. Elevated levels of delinquency or default would have an adverse impact on the value of our mortgage and residential real estate investments.\n\u2022\nWe may also experience more difficulty in our financing operations. COVID-19 has caused mortgage REITs to experience severe disruptions in financing operations (including the cost, attractiveness and availability of financing), in particular the ability to utilize repurchase financing and the margin requirements related to such financing. If conditions related to COVID-19 persist, we could experience an unwillingness or inability of our potential lenders to provide us with or renew financing, increased margin calls, and/or additional capital requirements. These conditions could force us to sell our assets at inopportune times or otherwise cause us to potentially revise our strategic business initiatives, which could adversely affect our business.\n\u2022\nThe continued spread of COVID-19 could also negatively impact the availability of key personnel necessary to conduct our business.\n\u2022\nGovernments have adopted, and may continue to adopt, policies, laws and plans intended to address the COVID-19 pandemic and adverse developments in the credit, financial, mortgage and rental markets. We cannot assure you that these programs will be effective, sufficient or otherwise have a positive impact on our business and could potentially have a negative impact on our business.\n\u2022\nThe analytical models and data we use to value our investments may be more prone to inaccuracies in light of the unprecedented conditions created by COVID-19. Further, COVID-19 has also created an uncertain and volatile environment whereby general fixed income patterns have deviated widely from historical trends.\nWe cannot predict the effect that government policies, laws and plans adopted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic will have on us.\nGovernments have adopted, and may continue to adopt, policies, laws and plans intended to address the COVID-19 pandemic and adverse developments in the credit, financial, mortgage and rental markets. While the U.S. Federal Reserve, the U.S. government and other governments have implemented unprecedented financial support or relief measures in response to concerns surrounding the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the likelihood of such measures calming the volatility in the financial markets or addressing a long term national or global economic downturn cannot be predicted and we cannot assure you that these programs will be effective, sufficient or otherwise have a positive impact on our business.\nRisks Related to Taxation\nOur failure to qualify as a REIT would result in higher taxes and reduced cash available for distribution to our stockholders.\nWe have elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2019, and we intend to operate so that we will qualify as a REIT. U.S. federal income tax laws governing REITs are complex, and interpretations of the U.S. federal income tax laws governing qualification as a REIT are limited. Qualifying as a REIT requires us to meet various tests regarding the nature of our assets and our income, the ownership of our outstanding stock, and the amount of our distributions on an ongoing basis.\nOur ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon the characterization and fair market values of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination, and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals. Our compliance with the REIT income and quarterly asset requirements also depends upon our ability to successfully manage the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis. Although we intend to operate so that we will qualify as a REIT, given the highly complex nature of the rules governing REITs, the ongoing importance of factual determinations, and the possibility of future changes in our circumstances, no assurance can be given that we will so qualify for any particular year.\nIf we fail to qualify as a REIT in any calendar year, we would be required to pay U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates, and dividends paid to our stockholders would not be deductible by us in computing our taxable income. Further, if we fail to qualify as a REIT, we might need to borrow money or sell assets in order to pay any resulting tax. Our payment of income tax would decrease the amount of our income available for distribution to our stockholders. Furthermore, if we fail to qualify or maintain our qualification as a REIT, we no longer would be required to distribute substantially all of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders. Unless our failure to qualify as a REIT was subject to relief under U.S. federal tax laws, we could not re-elect to qualify as a REIT for four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify.\nComplying with the REIT requirements can be difficult and may cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities.\nTo qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of our income, the nature and diversification of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our shares. We may be required to make distributions to our stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution, and may be unable to pursue otherwise attractive investments in order to satisfy the source-of-income or asset-diversification requirements for qualifying as a REIT. Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may hinder our ability to operate solely on the basis of maximizing profits.\nThe REIT distribution requirements could adversely affect our ability to execute our business strategies.\nWe generally must distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, excluding any net capital gain. We may use our net operating loss carryforward to reduce our REIT distribution requirement. To the extent that we satisfy the 90% distribution requirement, but distribute less than 100% of our taxable income, we will be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax, and may be subject to state and local income tax, on our undistributed taxable income. In addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we pay out to our stockholders in a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under U.S. federal income tax laws. We intend to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code and to avoid paying corporate income tax. However, differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash could require us to sell assets or borrow funds on a short-term or long-term basis to meet the distribution requirements of the Internal Revenue Code.\nFrom time to time, we may be required to recognize taxable income from our assets in advance of our receipt of cash flow on or proceeds from disposition of such assets. Also, our ability, or the ability of our subsidiaries, to deduct interest may be limited under Section 163(j) of the Internal Revenue Code. For example, if we purchase MBS at a discount, we generally are required to accrete the discount into taxable income prior to receiving the cash proceeds of the accreted discount at maturity. In addition, we may be required under the terms of indebtedness that we incur to use cash received from interest payments to make principal payments on that indebtedness, with the effect of recognizing income but not having a corresponding amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders. Additionally, if we incur capital losses in excess of capital gains, such net capital losses are not allowed to reduce our taxable income for purposes of determining our distribution requirement. They may be carried forward for a period of up to five years and applied against future capital gains subject to the limitation of our ability to generate sufficient capital gains, which cannot be assured.\nIf we do not have other funds available, we could be required to (i) sell assets in adverse market conditions, (ii) borrow on unfavorable terms, (iii) distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions, capital expenditures or repayment of debt, or (iv) distribute taxable dividends that are payable in cash or shares of our common stock at the election of each stockholder, to make distributions sufficient to enable us to pay out enough of our taxable income to satisfy the REIT distribution requirement and to avoid the corporate income tax and 4% excess tax in a particular year. Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may hinder our ability to grow, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nNet capital losses do not reduce our REIT distribution requirements, which may result in distribution requirements in excess of economic earnings.\nAs a REIT, we generally must distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, excluding any net capital gain. If we incur capital losses in excess of capital gains, such net capital losses are not allowed to reduce our taxable income for purposes of determining our distribution requirement. They may be carried forward for a period of up to five years and applied against future capital gains subject to the limitation of our ability to generate sufficient capital gains, which cannot be assured. Accordingly, if we generate a net capital loss during the year, the minimum amount of our REIT taxable income that we are required to distribute could exceed our net earnings for the year resulting in a reduction of our shareholders\u2019 equity capital.\nThe difference in character between our gains and losses on our agency MBS and our interest rate hedging transactions could make this situation more likely to occur. The gains and losses on the sale of our agency MBS generally are characterized as capital for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, our income and losses from interest rate hedging transactions that are designated as hedges generally are characterized as ordinary for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, to the extent that interest rates rise, the value of our interest rate hedging instruments increase in value while the value of our fixed-rate agency MBS decrease in value. As a result, we could realize annual ordinary income from our interest rate hedges that would not be offset, for purposes of the REIT distribution requirements, by annual net capital losses on our fixed-rate agency MBS. This could lead to a required distribution to our shareholders in excess of our net earnings, which could result in a reduction in our shareholders\u2019 equity.\nEven if we qualify as a REIT, we may face tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow.\nEven if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income and assets, including taxes on any undistributed income, tax on income from certain activities conducted as a result of a foreclosure, and\nstate or local income, property and transfer taxes, such as mortgage recording taxes, and other taxes. In addition, in order to meet the REIT qualification requirements, or to avoid the imposition of a 100% tax that applies to certain gains derived by a REIT from dealer property or inventory, we may hold certain assets through, and derive a significant portion of our taxable income and gains in, TRSs. Such subsidiaries are subject to corporate level income tax at regular rates. Any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distribution to our stockholders.\nLiquidation of assets may jeopardize our REIT qualification.\nTo qualify as a REIT, we must comply with requirements regarding our assets and our sources of income. If we are compelled to liquidate our investments to repay obligations to our lenders, we may be unable to comply with these requirements, ultimately jeopardizing our qualification as a REIT, or we may be subject to a 100% tax on any resultant gain if we sell assets that are treated as dealer property or inventory.\nThe failure of assets subject to repurchase agreements to be treated as owned by us for U.S. federal income tax purposes could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a REIT.\nWe have entered and may in the future enter into repurchase agreements that are structured as sale and repurchase agreements pursuant to which we nominally sell certain of our assets to a counterparty and simultaneously enter into an agreement to repurchase these assets at a later date in exchange for a purchase price. Economically, these agreements are financings that are secured by the assets sold pursuant thereto. We believe that we are treated for REIT asset and income test purposes as the owner of the assets that are the subject of any such sale and repurchase agreement notwithstanding that such agreements may transfer record ownership of the assets to the counterparty during the term of the agreement. It is possible, however, that the IRS could assert that we did not own the assets during the term of the sale and repurchase agreement, in which case we could fail to qualify as a REIT.\nComplying with the REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively.\nThe REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code could substantially limit our ability to hedge our assets and operations. Under current law, any income that we generate from transactions intended to hedge our interest rate or currency risks will be excluded from gross income for purposes of the REIT 75% and 95% gross income tests if (i) the instrument hedges risk of interest rate or currency fluctuations on indebtedness incurred or to be incurred to carry or acquire real estate assets, (ii) the instrument hedges risk of currency fluctuations with respect to any item of income or gain that would be qualifying income under the REIT 75% or 95% gross income tests, or (iii) the instrument was entered into to \u201coffset\u201d certain instruments described in clauses (i) or (ii) of this sentence and certain other requirements are satisfied and such instrument is properly identified under applicable Treasury Regulations. Income from hedging transactions that do not meet these requirements is likely to constitute nonqualifying income for purposes of both the REIT 75% and 95% gross income tests. As a result of these rules, we may have to limit our use of hedging techniques that might otherwise be advantageous to us or implement those hedges through a TRS. This could increase the cost of our hedging activities because a TRS would be subject to tax on gains or expose us to greater risks associated with interest rate fluctuations or other changes than we would otherwise want to bear.\nUncertainty exists with respect to the treatment of our TBAs for purposes of the REIT asset and income tests.\nWe purchase and sell agency MBS through TBAs and recognize income or gains from the disposition of those TBAs, through dollar roll transactions or otherwise, and may continue to do so in the future. While there is no direct authority with respect to the qualification of TBAs as real estate assets or U.S. Government securities for purposes of the REIT 75% asset test or the qualification of income or gains from dispositions of TBAs as gains from the sale of real property or other qualifying income for purposes of the REIT 75% gross income test, we treat our TBAs under which we contract to purchase a TBA agency MBS ( \u201clong TBAs\u201d) as qualifying assets for purposes of the REIT 75% asset test, and we treat income and gains from our long TBAs as qualifying income for purposes of the REIT 75% gross income test, based on an opinion of counsel substantially to the effect that (i) for purposes of the REIT asset tests, our ownership of a long TBA should be treated as ownership of real estate assets, and (ii) for purposes of the REIT 75% gross income test, any gain recognized by us in connection with the settlement of our long TBAs should be treated as gain from the sale or disposition of an interest in mortgages on real property. Opinions of counsel are not binding on the IRS, and no assurance can be given that the IRS will not successfully challenge the conclusions set forth in such opinions. In addition, it must be emphasized that the opinion of counsel is based on various assumptions relating to our TBAs and is conditioned upon fact-based representations and covenants made by our management regarding our TBAs. No assurance can be given that the IRS would not assert that such assets or income are not qualifying assets or income. If the IRS were to successfully challenge the opinion of counsel, we could be subject to a penalty tax or we could fail to remain qualified as a REIT if a sufficient portion of our assets consists of TBAs or a sufficient portion of our income consists of income or gains from the disposition of TBAs.\nThe tax on prohibited transactions will limit our ability to engage in transactions, including certain methods of securitizing MBS, that would be treated as sales for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nA REIT\u2019s net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a 100% tax with no offset for losses. In general, prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property, other than foreclosure property, but including mortgage loans, held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. We might be subject to this tax if we dispose of or securitize MBS in a manner that was treated as dealer activity for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Therefore, in order to avoid the prohibited transactions tax, we may choose not to engage in certain sales or securitization structures or to implement such transactions through a TRS, even though the transactions might otherwise be beneficial to us.\nDistributions to tax-exempt investors, or gains on sale of our common stock by tax-exempt investors, may be classified as unrelated business taxable income.\nNeither ordinary nor capital gain distributions with respect to our common stock nor gain from the sale of our common stock are anticipated to constitute unrelated business taxable income to a tax-exempt investor. However, there are certain exceptions to this rule. For example, if (i) all or a portion of our assets are subject to the rules relating to \"taxable mortgage pools\" or we hold residual interests in a REMIC; (ii) we are a \"pension held REIT;\" (iii) a tax-exempt stockholder has incurred debt to purchase or hold our common stock; or (iv) a tax-exempt stockholder is classified as a social club, voluntary employee benefit association, supplemental unemployment benefit trust or a qualified group legal services plan, then a portion of our distributions to tax-exempt stockholders and, in the case of stockholders described in clauses (iii) and (iv), gains realized on the sale of our common stock by tax-exempt stockholders may be subject to U.S. federal income tax as unrelated business taxable income under the Internal Revenue Code.\nCertain financing activities may subject us to U.S. federal income tax and could have negative tax consequences for our shareholders.\nWe currently do not intend to enter into any transactions that could result in our, or a portion of our assets, being treated as a taxable mortgage pool for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If we enter into such a transaction in the future we will be taxable at the highest corporate income tax rate on a portion of the income arising from a taxable mortgage pool, referred to as \"excess inclusion income,\" that is allocable to the percentage of our shares held in record name by disqualified organizations (generally tax-exempt entities that are exempt from the tax on unrelated business taxable income, such as state pension plans and charitable remainder trusts and government entities).\nIf we were to realize excess inclusion income, IRS guidance indicates that the excess inclusion income would be allocated among our shareholders in proportion to our dividends paid. Excess inclusion income cannot be offset by losses of our shareholders. If the shareholder is a tax-exempt entity and not a disqualified organization, then this income would be fully taxable as unrelated business taxable income under Section 512 of the Internal Revenue Code. If the shareholder is a foreign person, it would be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the maximum tax rate and withholding will be required on this income without reduction or exemption pursuant to any otherwise applicable income tax treaty.\nThe stock ownership limits applicable to us that are imposed by the Internal Revenue Code for REITs may restrict our business combination opportunities.\nIn order for us to maintain our qualification as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding shares may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code to include certain entities) at any time during the last half of each taxable year after our first taxable year.\nIn addition to the limitations on ownership under our Rights Plan, our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation contain customary \u201cownership limitation\u201d provisions that are designed to protect our ability to qualify as a REIT. Pursuant to our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, no person may own, or deemed to own by virtue of the attribution provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, in excess of (i) 9.9% of the number of the outstanding shares of our common stock, (ii) 9.9% in number of the outstanding shares of any class or series of our preferred stock, and (iii) 9.9% of the aggregate value of the outstanding shares of our equity stock. Our Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, with respect to any person, (i) grant an exemption from this 9.9% stock ownership limitation, and (ii) establish different ownership limitations for any such person.\nSuch stock ownership limits might delay or prevent a transaction or a change in our control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders.\nA REIT cannot invest more than 20% of its total assets in the stock or securities of one or more TRS.\nA TRS is a corporation, other than a REIT or a qualified REIT subsidiary, in which a REIT owns the stock and with which the REIT jointly elects TRS status. The term also includes a corporate subsidiary in which the TRS owns more than a 35% interest.\nA REIT may own up to 100% of the stock of one or more TRSs. A TRS may earn income that would not be qualifying income if it was earned directly by the parent REIT. Overall, at the close of any calendar quarter, no more than 20% of the value of a REIT\u2019s assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more TRSs.\nThe stock and securities of our TRSs are expected to represent less than 20% of the value of our total assets. Furthermore, we intend to monitor the value of our investments in the stock and securities of our TRSs to ensure compliance with the above-described limitation. We cannot assure you, however, that we will always be able to comply with the limitation so as to maintain REIT status.\nTRSs are subject to tax at the regular corporate rates, are not required to distribute dividends, and the amount of dividends a TRS can pay to its parent REIT may be limited by REIT gross income tests.\nA TRS must pay income tax at regular corporate rates on any income that it earns. Our TRSs will pay corporate income tax on their taxable income, and their after-tax net income will be available for distribution to us. In certain circumstances, the ability of our TRSs to deduct interest expense for federal income tax may be limited. Such income, however, is not required to be distributed.\nMoreover, the annual gross income tests that must be satisfied to ensure REIT qualification may limit the amount of dividends that we can receive from our TRSs and still maintain our REIT status. Generally, not more than 25% of our gross income can be derived from non-real estate related sources, such as dividends from a TRS. If, for any taxable year, the dividends we received from our TRSs, when added to our other items of non-real estate related income, represented more than 25% of our total gross income for the year, we could be denied REIT status, unless we were able to demonstrate, among other things, that our failure of the gross income test was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect.\nThe limitations imposed by the REIT gross income tests may impede our ability to distribute assets from our TRSs to us in the form of dividends. Certain asset transfers may, therefore, have to be structured as purchase and sale transactions upon which our TRSs recognize a taxable gain.\nIf interest accrues on indebtedness owed by a TRS to its parent REIT at a rate in excess of a commercially reasonable rate, or if transactions between a REIT and a TRS are entered into on other than arm\u2019s-length terms, the REIT may be subject to a penalty tax.\nIf interest accrues on an indebtedness owed by a TRS to its parent REIT at a rate in excess of a commercially reasonable rate, the REIT is subject to tax at a rate of 100% on the excess of (i) interest payments made by a TRS to its parent REIT over (ii) the amount of interest that would have been payable had interest accrued on the indebtedness at a commercially reasonable rate. A tax at a rate of 100% is also imposed on any transaction between a TRS and its parent REIT to the extent the transaction gives rise to deductions to the TRS that are in excess of the deductions that would have been allowable had the transaction been entered into on arm\u2019s-length terms. While we will scrutinize all of our transactions with our TRSs in an effort to ensure that we do not become subject to these taxes, there is no assurance that we will be successful. We may not be able to avoid application of these taxes.\nNew legislation or administrative or judicial action, in each instance potentially with retroactive effect, could make it more difficult or impossible for us to qualify as a REIT.\nThe present U.S. federal income tax treatment of REITs may be modified, possibly with retroactive effect, by legislative, judicial or administrative action at any time, which could affect the U.S. federal income tax treatment of an investment in our common stock. The U.S. federal tax rules that affect REITs are under review constantly by persons involved in the legislative process, the IRS and the U.S. Treasury Department, which results in statutory changes as well as frequent revisions to Treasury regulations and interpretations. Revisions in U.S. federal tax laws and interpretations thereof could cause us to change our investments and commitments, which could also affect the tax considerations of an investment in our stock. In addition, several proposals have been made that would make substantial changes to the federal income tax laws generally. We cannot predict whether any of these proposed changes will become law. We cannot predict the long-term effect of any recent law changes or any future law changes on REITs and their stockholders. Any such changes could have an adverse effect on the market value of our securities or our ability to make dividends to our shareholders.\nThe ability of our Board of Directors to revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT election without stockholder approval may cause adverse consequences to our stockholders.\nOur charter provides that our Board of Directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT election, without the approval of our stockholders, upon the requisite vote of our Board of Directors. If we cease to qualify as a REIT, we would become subject to U.S. federal income tax on our net taxable income and we generally would no longer be required to distribute any of our net taxable income to our stockholders, which may have adverse consequences on the total return to our stockholders.\nWe may not be able to generate future taxable income to fully utilize NOL and NCL carryforwards.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had an estimated NOL carryforward of $165.0 million that can be used to offset future taxable ordinary income and reduce our future distribution requirements. Estimated NOL carryforwards totaling $14.6 million expire in 2028 and NOL carryforwards totaling $150.4 million have no expiration period. As of December 31, 2021, we also had NCL carryforwards of $127.1 million that can be used to offset future net capital gains. The scheduled expirations of our NCL carryforwards are $3.8 million in 2022, $110.3 million in 2023 and $13.0 million in 2026. We can utilize our NCL carryforward to reduce our net capital gain income that would be subject to income taxes to the extent it is not distributed to our shareholders. Utilizing our NOL and NCL carryforwards may allow us to reduce our required distributions to shareholders or income tax liability which would allow us to retain future taxable income as capital. However, we may not generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate tax character to fully utilize these carryforwards prior to their expiration. To the extent that our NOL or NCL carryforwards expire unutilized, we may not fully realize the benefit of these tax attributes which could lead to higher annual distribution requirements or tax liabilities.\nOur ability to use our tax benefits could be substantially limited if we experience an \u201cownership change.\u201d\nOur NOL and NCL carryforwards and certain recognized built-in losses may be limited by Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code if we experience an \u201cownership change.\u201d In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs if 5% shareholders increase their collective ownership of the aggregate amount of the outstanding shares of our company by more than 50 percentage points looking back over the relevant testing period. If an ownership change occurs, our ability to use our NOLs, NCLs and certain recognized built-in losses to reduce our REIT distribution requirement or taxable income in a future year would be limited to a Section 382 limitation equal to the fair market value of our stock immediately prior to the ownership change multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt interest rate in effect for the month of the ownership change. In the event of an ownership change, NOLs and NCLs that exceed the Section 382 limitation in any year will continue to be allowed as carryforwards for the remainder of the carryforward period and such losses can be used to offset taxable income for years within the carryforward period subject to the Section 382 limitation in each year. However, if the carryforward period for any NOL or NCL were to expire before that loss had been fully utilized, the unused portion of that loss would be lost. Our use of new NOLs or NCLs arising after the date of an ownership change would not be affected by the Section 382 limitation (unless there were another ownership change after those new losses arose).\nWe have a Rights Plan designed to protect against the occurrence of an ownership change. The Rights Plan is intended to act as a deterrent to any person or group acquiring 4.9% or more of our outstanding common stock without the approval of our Board of Directors. See \u201cRisks Related to our Business and Structure - Our Rights Plan could inhibit a change in our control\u201d for information on our Rights Plan. The Rights Plan and any outstanding rights will expire at the earliest of (i) June 4, 2022, (ii) the time at which the rights are redeemed or exchanged pursuant to the Rights Plan, (iii) the repeal of Section 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code or any successor statute if the Board of Directors determines that the Rights Plan is no longer necessary for the preservation of the applicable tax benefits, or (iv) the beginning of a taxable year to which the Board of Directors determines that no applicable tax benefits may be carried forward. If our Board of Directors and shareholders do not approve an amendment to extend the expiration of the Rights Plan, our ability to protect against an ownership change under Section 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code would be greatly limited upon its expiration on June 4, 2022, which may result in us losing all or most of the anticipated tax benefits with our prior losses.\nIn addition, the Rights Plan does not protect against all transactions that could cause an ownership change, such as public issuances and repurchases of shares of our common stock. The Rights Plan may not be successful in preventing an ownership change within the meaning of Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, and we may lose all or most of the anticipated tax benefits associated with our prior losses.\nBased on our knowledge of our stock ownership, we do not believe that an ownership change has occurred since our losses were generated. Accordingly, we believe that at the current time there is no annual limitation imposed on our use of our NOLs and NCLs to reduce future taxable income. The determination of whether an ownership change has occurred or will occur is complicated and depends on changes in percentage stock ownership among shareholders. Other than the Rights Plan, there are currently no restrictions on the transfer of our stock that would discourage or prevent transactions that could cause an ownership change, although we may adopt such restrictions in the future. As discussed above, the Rights Plan is intended to discourage transactions that could cause an ownership change. In addition, we have not obtained, and currently do not plan to obtain, a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, regarding our conclusion as to whether our losses are subject to any such limitations. Furthermore, we may decide in the future that it is necessary or in our interest to take certain actions that could result in an ownership change. Therefore, no assurance can be provided as to whether an ownership change has occurred or will occur in the future.\nPreserving the ability to use our NOLs and NCLs may cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities.\nLimitations imposed by Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code may discourage us from, among other things, repurchasing our stock or issuing additional stock to raise capital or to acquire businesses or assets. Accordingly, our desire to preserve our NOLs and NCLs may cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities.", "PERMNO": 85653, "SIC": 6799, "TIC": "AI"}
