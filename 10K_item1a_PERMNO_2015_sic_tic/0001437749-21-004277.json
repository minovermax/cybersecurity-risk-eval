{"cik": "21535", "company": "COHU INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nIn addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in evaluating Cohu and our business (the \u201crisk factors\u201d). Many of the following risks and uncertainties are, and will be, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and any worsening of the global business and economic environment as a result. If any of the identified risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment in our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only ones we face. Additional risks that we currently do not know about, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, may also impair our business operations or the trading price of our common stock.\nRisk Factors Summary\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk. The following is a summary of the principal factors that make an investment in our securities speculative or risky, all of which are more fully described below. This summary should be read in conjunction with the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d described below and should not be relied upon as a complete summary of the material risks facing our business.\nRisks Relating to Our Business Operations and Industry\n\u25cf\nThe ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and is continuing to adversely affect, our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u25cf\nWe are making investments in new products and product enhancements, which may adversely affect our operating results; these investments may not be commercially successful.\n\u25cf\nWe are exposed to the risks of operating a global business.\n\u25cf\nWe have manufacturing operations in Asia. Any failure to effectively manage multiple manufacturing sites and to secure raw materials meeting our quality, cost and other requirements, or failures by our suppliers to perform, could harm our sales, service levels and reputation.\n\u25cf\nFailure of critical suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of parts in a timely and cost-effective manner could adversely impact our operations.\n\u25cf\nThe semiconductor industry we serve is seasonal, volatile and unpredictable.\n\u25cf\nThe semiconductor equipment and printed circuit board (\u201cPCB\u201d) test industries are intensely competitive.\n\u25cf\nSemiconductor equipment is subject to rapid technological change, product introductions and transitions which may result in inventory write-offs, and our new product development involves numerous risks and uncertainties.\n\u25cf\nThe seasonal nature of the semiconductor equipment industry places enormous demands on our employees, operations and infrastructure.\n\u25cf\nA limited number of customers account for a substantial percentage of our net sales.\n\u25cf\nA majority of our revenues are generated from exports to foreign countries, primarily in Asia, that are subject to economic and political instability and we compete against a number of Asia-based test contactor, test handler, automated test equipment and PCB test suppliers.\nRisks Relating to our Indebtedness, Financing and Future Access to Capital\n\u25cf\nThe incurrence of substantial indebtedness in connection with our financing of the Xcerra acquisition may have an adverse impact on Cohu\u2019s liquidity, limit Cohu\u2019s flexibility in responding to other business opportunities and increase Cohu\u2019s vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions.\n\u25cf\nOur Credit Agreement contains various representations and negative covenants that limit, subject to certain exceptions and baskets, our ability and/or our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to enter into financing and other transactions relating to our assets.\n\u25cf\nCohu has total consolidated debt of $319.9 million as of December 26, 2020 and because of such high debt levels we may not be able to service our debt obligations in accordance with their terms; the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act severely limits the deductibility of interest expense.\n\u25cf\nThe issuance of shares of our common stock in connection with any future offerings of securities by us, will dilute our shareholders\u2019 ownership interest in the company.\nRisks Relating to Acquisitions and Other Strategic Transactions\n\u25cf\nWe are exposed to other risks associated with other acquisitions, investments and divestitures.\n\u25cf\nWe expect to continue to evaluate and pursue divestitures of non-core assets.\nRisks Relating to Owning Our Stock\n\u25cf\nOur financial and operating results may vary and fall below analysts\u2019 estimates, or credit rating agencies may change their ratings on Cohu, any of which may cause the price of our common stock to decline or make it difficult to obtain other financing.\nRisks Relating to Regulatory Matters\n\u25cf\nGlobal economic and political conditions, including trade tariffs and export restrictions, have impacted our business and may continue to have an impact on our business and financial condition.\nRisks Relating to Cybersecurity, the Economy, and Litigation\n\u25cf\nOur business and operations could suffer in the event of cybersecurity breaches.\nFor a more complete discussion of the material risks facing our business, see below.\nRisks Relating to Our Business Operations and Industry\nThe ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and is continuing to adversely affect, our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and is continuing to adversely affect, our business, financial condition and results of operations. As the COVID-19 virus has spread rapidly and globally, from March 2020 and continuing to the present, authorities have implemented numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and shutdowns, including in all of the jurisdictions where we operate. These measures have adversely impacted, and are continuing to adversely impact, our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers, and those of our respective vendors and suppliers. We have significant operations in the U.S., Germany, Switzerland, Malaysia, Japan and the Philippines, and each of these countries has been significantly affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been common for restrictions to be implemented, relaxed and then implemented again with little or no notice, which adversely impacts our ability to accurately predict our future revenue and budget future expenses and is disruptive to our operations.\nAlthough we believe that Cohu qualifies as an \u201cessential business\u201d in the jurisdictions in which we operate, our business has been, and is continuing to be, adversely impacted by evolving and extended public health requirements around the world; government-mandated facility shutdowns; import/export, shipping and logistics disruptions and delays; other supply chain and distribution constraints or delays; rapid changes to business, political or regulatory conditions affecting the semiconductor equipment industry and the overall global economy; availability of employees and lost employee productivity; risks associated with, at times, temporarily housing employees in our Malaysia and Philippines factories; remote working IT and increased cybersecurity risks; increased internal control risks over financial reporting as key finance staff work remotely; delayed product development programs; customers\u2019 canceling, pushing out orders or refusal to accept product deliveries; delayed collection of receivables; other actions of our customers, suppliers and competitors which may be sudden and inconsistent with our expectations; higher shipping and logistics costs; higher component costs; manufacturing capacity limitations; additional credit rating agency downgrades could occur which would increase our cost of raising capital; and potential additional impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets or inventory write-downs due to lower product demand may become necessary. Any of the foregoing COVID-19 driven impacts may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, and may also have the effect of increasing the likelihood and/or magnitude of other risks described in these risk factors. We continuously monitor the pandemic but cannot predict its future course or impacts.\nWe are making investments in new products and product enhancements, which may adversely affect our operating results; these investments may not be commercially successful.\nGiven the highly competitive and rapidly evolving technology environment in which we operate, we believe it is important to develop new and enhanced product offerings to meet strategic opportunities as they evolve. This includes developing products that we believe are necessary to meet the future needs of the marketplace and to enter new markets. We are currently significantly investing in new product development programs relating to test contactors, test handlers and automated test equipment. For example, in fiscal 2020, we incurred $86.2 million in research and development expenses. We expect to continue to make investments and we may, at any time, based on product need or marketplace demand, decide to significantly increase our product development expenditures in these or other products. The cost of investments in new product offerings and product enhancements can have a negative impact on our operating results. We have in the past made material investments in new product platforms that for various reasons, such as technical challenges or lack of customer adoption, have not generated the expected sales or return. There can be no assurance that other new products we develop will be accepted in the marketplace or generate material revenues for us.\nWe are exposed to the risks of operating a global business.\nWe are a global corporation with offices and subsidiaries in certain foreign locations to manufacture our products, support our sales and services to the global semiconductor industry and, as such, we face risks in doing business abroad. For example, while our corporate headquarters are located in California, additional key engineering, sales, and administrative personnel are located in China, Germany, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Switzerland, Taiwan and elsewhere in the U.S., and our manufacturing operations are primarily located in Germany, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines and the U.S. Certain aspects inherent in transacting business internationally could negatively impact our operating results, including:\n\u25cf\ncosts and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;\n\u25cf\nlegislative or regulatory requirements and potential changes in or interpretations of requirements in the United States and in the countries in which we manufacture or sell our products;\n\u25cf\ntrade restrictions, including treaty changes, sanctions and the suspension of export licenses;\n\u25cf\ncompliance with and changes in import/export tariffs and regulations;\n\u25cf\ncomplex labor laws and privacy regulations;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties in adequately supervising employees widely distributed around the world (including due to implementing remote work arrangements in response to the COVID-19 pandemic);\n\u25cf\ndifficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf\nlonger payment cycles;\n\u25cf\nhealth epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u25cf\nlocal and global political and economic conditions, including ongoing uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and its implications;\n\u25cf\nnatural disasters and geopolitical instability;\n\u25cf\nvaried environmental laws and regulations at each of our principal locations;\n\u25cf\ncomplex tax laws and potentially adverse tax consequences, including restrictions on repatriating earnings and the threat of \u201cdouble taxation;\u201d and\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. Dollar, which can affect demand for our products and increase our costs.\nAdditionally, managing geographically dispersed operations presents difficult challenges associated with organizational alignment and infrastructure, communications and information technology, inventory control, customer relationship management, terrorist threats and related security matters and cultural diversities. If we are unsuccessful in managing such operations effectively, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nWe continue to monitor global privacy laws and legislation to determine its impact on our business. We do not sell to consumers nor process individual credit card information, but do maintain certain personally identifiable information on our employees. Such employee information may be subject to the EU General Data Protection Regulation and the recently effective California Consumer Protection Act. We believe that we have implemented reasonable procedures and internal controls in compliance with these laws, but should such actions be insufficient, we may be subject to regulatory investigations, fines and legal costs. If one or more of these risks occurs, it could require us to dedicate significant resources to remedy, and if we are unsuccessful in finding a solution, our financial results will suffer.\nWe have manufacturing operations in Asia. Any failure to effectively manage multiple manufacturing sites and to secure raw materials meeting our quality, cost and other requirements, or failures by our suppliers to perform, could harm our sales, service levels and reputation.\nA substantial majority of our products are manufactured in Asia. Our reliance on overseas manufacturers exposes us to significant risks including complex management, foreign currency, legal, tax and economic risks, which we may not be able to address quickly and adequately. In addition, it is time consuming and costly to qualify overseas supplier relationships. If we should fail to effectively manage overseas manufacturing operations or logistics, or if one or more of them should experience delays, disruptions or quality control problems, or if we had to change or add additional manufacturing sites, our ability to ship products to our customers could be delayed. Also, the addition of overseas manufacturing locations increases the demands on our administrative and operations infrastructure and the complexity of our supply chain management and logistics. Our overseas sites are more susceptible to impacts from natural disasters, health epidemics and geopolitical instability (see risk factors entitled \u201cThe ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and is continuing to adversely affect, our business, financial condition and results of operations\u201d and \u201cThe occurrence of natural disasters, health epidemics, corruption and geopolitical instability caused by terrorist attacks and other threats may adversely impact our operations and sales\u201d). If our overseas manufacturing locations are unable to meet our manufacturing requirements in a timely manner, our ability to ship products and to realize the related revenues when anticipated could be materially affected.\nOur suppliers are subject to the fluctuations in general economic cycles, and global economic conditions may impact their ability to operate their businesses. They may also be impacted by possible import, export, tariff and other trade barriers, increasing costs of raw materials, labor and distribution, resulting in demands for less attractive contract terms or an inability for them to meet our requirements or conduct their own businesses. Additionally, consolidation in our supply chain due to mergers and acquisitions may reduce the number of suppliers or change our relationships with them. The performance and financial condition of a supplier may cause us to alter our business terms or to cease doing business with a particular supplier, or change our sourcing practices generally, which could in turn adversely affect our own business and financial condition. Failure to effectively manage our manufacturing and our relationships with our suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nFailure of critical suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of parts in a timely and cost-effective manner could adversely impact our operations.\nWe use numerous vendors to supply parts, components and subassemblies for the manufacture of our products. It is not always possible to maintain multiple qualified suppliers for all of our parts, components and subassemblies. As a result, many key parts may be available only from a single supplier (\u201csole source\u201d) or a limited number of suppliers. In addition, suppliers may significantly raise prices or cease manufacturing certain components (with or without advance notice to us) that are difficult to replace without significant reengineering of our products. On occasion, we have experienced problems in obtaining adequate and reliable quantities of various parts and components from certain key or sole source suppliers. Our results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted if we do not receive sufficient parts to meet our requirements in a timely and cost-effective manner.\nThe semiconductor industry we serve is seasonal, volatile and unpredictable.\nVisibility into our markets is limited. The semiconductor equipment business is highly dependent on the overall strength of the semiconductor industry. Historically, the semiconductor industry has been seasonal with recurring periods of oversupply and excess capacity, which often have had a significant effect on the semiconductor industry\u2019s demand for capital equipment, including equipment of the type we manufacture and market. We anticipate that the markets for newer generations of semiconductors and semiconductor equipment will also be subject to similar cycles and severe downturns. Any significant reductions in capital equipment investment by semiconductor integrated device manufacturers and test subcontractors will materially and adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations. In addition, the seasonal, volatile and unpredictable nature of semiconductor equipment demand has in the past and may in the future expose us to significant excess and obsolete and lower of cost or net realizable value inventory write-offs and reserve requirements. In 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recorded pre-tax inventory-related charges of approximately $6.0 million, $4.1 million, and $1.4 million, respectively, primarily as a result of changes in customer forecasts. We saw weakness in market conditions in 2019, followed by COVID-19 driven uncertainties in 2020, then a significant market recovery beginning in third quarter 2020. Abrupt, unexpected and severe demand changes have occurred in the past and are expected to reoccur in the future within our industry.\nThe semiconductor equipment and PCB test industries are intensely competitive.\nThe industries we serve are intensely competitive, and we face substantial competition from numerous companies throughout the world. The test handler industry, while relatively small in terms of worldwide market size compared to other segments of the semiconductor equipment industry, has several participants resulting in intense competitive pricing pressures. Future competition may include companies that do not currently supply test handlers. Similarly, the PCB test industry is characterized by significant Asia-based competition and intense price competition. Some of our competitors are part of larger corporations that have substantially greater financial, engineering, manufacturing and customer support capabilities and provide more extensive product offerings. In addition, there are emerging companies that provide or may provide innovative technology incorporated in products that may compete successfully against our products. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and introduce new products with improved performance capabilities. Our failure to introduce new products in a timely manner, the introduction by our competitors of products with perceived or actual advantages, or disputes over rights to use certain intellectual property or technology could result in a loss of our competitive position and reduced sales of, or margins on our existing products. Intense competition has adversely impacted our product average selling prices and gross margins on certain products. If we are unable to reduce the cost of our existing products and successfully introduce new lower cost products, then we expect that these competitive conditions would negatively impact our gross margin and operating results in the foreseeable future.\nWe have increased investments in our test contactor business and announced significant growth targets for the business over the next several years, but due to weak market conditions we did not achieve our growth goals in 2019 and 2020. The test contactor market is fragmented, with many entrenched regional players, and subject to intense price competition and high localized customer support requirements. We believe that customer support and responsiveness and an ability to consistently meet tight deadlines is critical to our success. If we are unable to reduce the cost of our test contactor products, while also meeting customer support requirements and deadlines, then we expect that these competitive conditions would negatively impact our test contactor operating results and impede us from achieving our test contactor sales goals.\nIn addition, with the Xcerra acquisition, Cohu entered the automated test equipment (\u201cATE\u201d) market. Our ability to increase our ATE sales will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain orders from new customers. Semiconductor and electronics manufacturers typically select a particular vendor\u2019s product for testing new generations of a device and make substantial investments to develop related test program applications and interfaces. Once a manufacturer has selected an ATE vendor for a new generation of a device, that manufacturer is more likely to purchase systems from that vendor for that generation of the device, and, possibly, subsequent generations of that device as well. Cohu has a niche position and relatively low share in the ATE market, and this market is primarily driven by two larger companies with significantly more resources to invest into the ATE market. Therefore, the opportunities to obtain orders from new customers or existing customers may be limited, which may impair our ability to grow our ATE revenue. These factors may materially and adversely affect our current and future target markets and our ability to compete successfully in those markets.\nSemiconductor equipment is subject to rapid technological change, product introductions and transitions which may result in inventory write-offs, and our new product development involves numerous risks and uncertainties.\nSemiconductor equipment and processes are subject to rapid technological change. We believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to enhance existing products and develop new products with improved performance capabilities. We expect to continue to invest heavily in research and development and must manage product transitions successfully, as introductions of new products, including the products obtained in our acquisitions, may adversely impact sales and/or margins of existing products. In addition, the introduction of new products by us or by our competitors, the concentration of our revenues in a limited number of large customers, the migration to new semiconductor testing methodologies and the custom nature of our inventory parts increases the risk that our established products and related inventory may become obsolete, resulting in significant excess and obsolete inventory exposure. This exposure resulted in charges to operations during each of the years in the three-year period ended December 26, 2020. Future inventory write-offs and increased inventory reserve requirements could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe design, development, commercial introduction and manufacture of new semiconductor equipment is an inherently complex process that involves a number of risks and uncertainties. These risks include potential problems in meeting customer acceptance and performance requirements, integration of the equipment with other suppliers\u2019 equipment and the customers\u2019 manufacturing processes, transitioning from product development to volume manufacturing and the ability of the equipment to satisfy the semiconductor industry\u2019s constantly evolving needs and achieve commercial acceptance at prices that produce satisfactory profit margins. The design and development of new semiconductor equipment is heavily influenced by changes in integrated circuit assembly, test and final manufacturing processes and integrated circuit package design changes. We believe that the rate of change in such processes and integrated circuit packages is accelerating. As a result of these changes and other factors, assessing the market potential and commercial viability of test handling, ATE, MEMS, system-level and burn-in test equipment and test contactors is extremely difficult and subject to a great deal of risk. In addition, not all integrated circuit manufacturers employ the same manufacturing processes. Differences in such processes make it difficult to design standard test products that can achieve broad market acceptance. As a result, we might not accurately assess the semiconductor industry\u2019s future equipment requirements and fail to design and develop products that meet such requirements and achieve market acceptance. Failure to accurately assess customer requirements and market trends for new semiconductor test products may have a material adverse impact on our operations, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe transition from product development to the manufacture of new semiconductor equipment is a difficult process and delays in product introductions and problems in manufacturing such equipment are common. We have in the past and may in the future experience difficulties in manufacturing and volume production of our new equipment. In addition, as is common with semiconductor equipment, after sale support and warranty costs have typically been significantly higher with new products than with our established products. Future technologies, processes and product developments may render our current or future product offerings obsolete and we might not be able to develop, introduce and successfully manufacture new products or make enhancements to our existing products in a timely manner to satisfy customer requirements or achieve market acceptance. Furthermore, we might not realize acceptable profit margins on such products.\nThe seasonal nature of the semiconductor equipment industry places enormous demands on our employees, operations and infrastructure.\nThe semiconductor equipment industry is characterized by dramatic and sometimes rapid changes in demand for its products. These are generally dictated by introduction of new consumer products, launch of new model vehicles, implementation of new communications infrastructure, or in response to an increase in industrial equipment and machinery that utilizes semiconductors. A number of other factors including changes in integrated circuit design and packaging may affect demand for our products. Sudden changes in demand for semiconductor equipment commonly occur, and have a significant impact on our operations, and such changes in demand (up or down) are difficult to predict and proactively plan for. We have in the past and may in the future experience difficulties, particularly in manufacturing, in training and recruiting the large number of additions to our workforce. The volatility in headcount and business levels, combined with the seasonal nature of the semiconductor industry, may require that we invest substantial amounts in new operational and financial systems, procedures and controls. We may not be able to successfully adjust our systems, facilities and production capacity to meet our customers\u2019 changing requirements. Any inability to meet such requirements will have an adverse impact on our business, financial position and results of operations. Sudden demand changes (as, for example, we experienced in 2019 and 2020) in business conditions, positive or negative, are common in our industry but the timing of such changes is very difficult to predict.\nA limited number of customers account for a substantial percentage of our net sales.\nA small number of customers have been responsible for a significant portion of our net sales. For fiscal year 2020, net revenue from our ten largest customers represented 47% of our total net revenue. During the past five years, the percentage of our sales derived from these significant customers has varied greatly. Such variations are due to changes in the customers\u2019 business, consolidation within the semiconductor industry and their purchase of products from our competitors. It is common in the semiconductor equipment industry for customers to purchase products from more than one equipment supplier, increasing the risk that our competitive position with a specific customer may deteriorate. No assurance can be given that we will continue to maintain our competitive position with these or other significant customers. Also, consolidation in the semiconductor industry may reduce our customer base and could adversely affect the market for our products, which could cause a decline in our revenues. With consolidation, the number of actual and potential customers for our products has decreased in recent years. Consolidation may lead to relatively fewer opportunities to sell our products if we are not chosen as a supplier by any given prospective customer, and may lead to increased pricing pressures from customers that have greater volume purchasing power.\nWe expect the percentage of our revenues derived from significant customers will vary greatly in future periods. The loss of, or a significant reduction in, orders by these or other significant customers as a result of competitive products, market conditions including end market demand for our customers\u2019 products, outsourcing final semiconductor test to test subcontractors that are not our customers or other factors, would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the concentration of our revenues in a limited number of large customers is likely to cause significant fluctuations in our future annual and quarterly operating results.\nA majority of our revenues are generated from exports to foreign countries, primarily in Asia, that are subject to economic and political instability and we compete against a number of Asia-based test contactor, test handler, automated test equipment and PCB test suppliers.\nThe majority of our export sales are made to destinations in Asia. Political or economic instability, particularly in Asia, may adversely impact the demand for capital equipment, including equipment of the type we manufacture and market (see risk factor \u201cGlobal economic and political conditions, including trade tariffs and export restrictions, have impacted our business and may continue to have an impact on our business and financial condition\u201d). In addition, we face intense competition from a number of Asian suppliers that have certain advantages over United States (U.S.) suppliers, including us. These advantages include, among other things, proximity to customers, lower cost structures, a willingness to compete solely on price, favorable tariffs and affiliation with significantly larger organizations. In addition, changes in the amount or price of semiconductors produced in Asia could impact the profitability or capital equipment spending programs of our foreign and domestic customers.\nIf we cannot continue to develop, manufacture, market and support products and services that meet customer requirements for innovation and quality, our revenue and gross margin may suffer.\nThe process of developing new high technology products and services and enhancing existing products and services is complex, costly and uncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate customers\u2019 changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our sales and results of operations. Our customers\u2019 selection processes typically are lengthy and can require us to incur significant sales, service and engineering resources, and regularly to provide the customer evaluation systems for several months at no charge, in pursuit of a single customer opportunity. We may not win the competitive selection process and may never generate any revenue despite incurring such expenditures. The delays inherent in these lengthy sales cycles increase the risk that a customer will decide to cancel, curtail, reduce or delay its product plans, causing us to lose anticipated sales.\nIn addition, in the course of conducting our business, we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products and services, including defects in our engineering, design and manufacturing processes, as well as defects in third-party components included in our products. To address quality issues, we work extensively with our customers and suppliers and engage in product testing to determine the cause of quality problems and appropriate solutions. Finding solutions to quality issues can be expensive and may result in additional warranty, replacement and other costs. In addition, if any of our products contain defects or have reliability, quality or safety issues, we may need to conduct a product recall which could result in significant repair or replacement costs and substantial delays in product shipments and may damage our reputation, which could make it more difficult to sell our products. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our reputation, which could lead to a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur global Enterprise Resource Management (\u201cERP\u201d) upgrade may adversely affect our business and results of operations or the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting.\nWe are in final development stages of a phased global replacement of our existing ERP solution and launched the first phase of such new ERP solution in first and fourth quarter 2020. The second phase and rollout is planned throughout 2021. The new solution is being developed as an enterprise solution in partnership with a leading provider of ERP tools. Additional investments in enterprise tools that focus on product life-cycle management, our customer experience, and supply chain management are in process to support our growing business. These implementations are extremely complex and time-consuming projects that involve substantial expenditures on software and implementation activities. If we do not effectively implement the system or if the system does not operate as intended, it could result in the loss or corruption of data, delayed order processing and shipments and increased costs. It could also adversely affect our financial reporting systems and our ability to produce financial reports and process transactions, the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe loss of key personnel could adversely impact our business.\nCertain key personnel are critical to our business. Our future operating results depend substantially upon the continued service of our key personnel, many of whom are not bound by employment or non-competition agreements. Our future operating results also depend in significant part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management, manufacturing, technical, engineering, marketing, sales and support personnel. Competition for qualified personnel, particularly those with technical skills, is intense, and we cannot ensure success in attracting or retaining qualified personnel. In addition, the cost of living in the San Diego and Bay Area, California; Boston, Massachusetts; St. Paul, Minnesota; Lincoln, Rhode Island; Kolbermoor and Wertheim, Germany; La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland and Osaka, Japan areas, where the majority of our engineering personnel are located, is high and we have had difficulty in recruiting prospective employees from other locations. There may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills and relevant industry experience to serve in these positions and it may become increasingly difficult for us to hire personnel over time. More recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the risks that our executives and other key employees may be suddenly unable to perform their duties due to health or other personal responsibilities. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of our key employees, by the failure of any key employee to perform in his or her current position, or by our inability to attract and retain skilled employees.\nThird parties may violate our proprietary rights or accuse us of infringing upon their proprietary rights.\nWe rely on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products. Any of our proprietary rights may expire due to patent life, or be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. In addition, from time-to-time, we receive notices from third parties regarding patent or copyright claims. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming to defend, result in costly litigation, divert management\u2019s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to license the infringed technology or to substitute similar non-infringing technology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We are also subject to the theft and misappropriation of intellectual property by others, including incidents relating to former employees. We believe we are taking reasonable actions to protect and improve our security, through strengthened IT infrastructure and internal controls, but if these actions are not successful our business could be adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to our Indebtedness, Financing and Future Access to Capital\nThe incurrence of substantial indebtedness in connection with our financing of the Xcerra acquisition may have an adverse impact on Cohu\u2019s liquidity, limit Cohu\u2019s flexibility in responding to other business opportunities and increase Cohu\u2019s vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions.\nIn connection with the Xcerra acquisition, Cohu entered into a term loan facility, with an aggregate principal amount of $350.0 million (the \u201cDebt Financing\u201d or \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d). Such indebtedness has reduced Cohu\u2019s liquidity and has caused Cohu to place more reliance on cash generated from operations to pay principal and interest on Cohu\u2019s debt, thereby reducing the availability of Cohu\u2019s cash flow for working capital and capital expenditure needs or to pursue other potential strategic plans. In addition, our indebtedness may make us more vulnerable to changes in general economic conditions and/or a downturn in our business, thereby making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations. During the second half of 2020, Cohu took action to reduce outstanding principal under its Debt Financing; however, Cohu gives no future assurance as to if, when or how much any subsequent voluntary principal reductions may be. If we fail to make required debt payments, or if we fail to comply with financial or other covenants in our Credit Agreement, we would be in default under the agreement.\nOur Credit Agreement contains various representations and negative covenants that limit, subject to certain exceptions and baskets, our ability and/or our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things:\n\u25cf\nincur or assume liens or additional debt or provide guarantees in respect of obligations of other persons;\n\u25cf\nissue redeemable stock and preferred stock;\n\u25cf\npay cash dividends or make distributions on capital stock, repurchase, redeem or make payments on capital stock;\n\u25cf\nenter into rate, commodity, equity or currency swap, hedging or other similar transactions;\n\u25cf\nmake loans, investments or acquisitions;\n\u25cf\nenter into agreements that restrict distributions from our subsidiaries;\n\u25cf\ncreate or permit restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to us or to guarantee our debt, limit our or any of our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to create liens, or that require the grant of a lien to secure an obligation if a lien is granted to secure another obligation;\n\u25cf\nsell assets and capital stock of our subsidiaries;\n\u25cf\nenter into certain transactions with affiliates;\n\u25cf\nsell, transfer, license, lease or dispose of our or our subsidiaries\u2019 assets; and\n\u25cf\ndissolve, liquidate, consolidate or merge with or into, or sell substantially all the assets of us and our subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to, another person.\nThe restrictions contained in our Credit Agreement could adversely affect our ability to:\n\u25cf\nfinance our operations;\n\u25cf\nmake needed capital expenditures;\n\u25cf\nmake strategic acquisitions or investments or enter into alliances;\n\u25cf\nwithstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general;\n\u25cf\nengage in business activities, including future opportunities, that may be in our interest; and\n\u25cf\nplan for or react to market conditions or otherwise execute our business strategies.\nA breach of any of these negative covenants could result in a default under the Credit Agreement. Further, additional indebtedness that we incur in the future may subject us to further covenants. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under the agreements governing the relevant indebtedness. The lender may accelerate the payment terms of the Credit Agreement upon the occurrence of certain events of default set forth therein, which include: the failure of Cohu to make timely payments of amounts due under the Credit Agreement, the failure of Cohu to adhere to the representations and covenants set forth in the Credit Agreement, the failure to provide notice of any event that causes a material adverse effect or to provide other required notices, upon the event that related collateral agreements become ineffective, upon the event that certain legal judgments are entered against Cohu, the insolvency of Cohu, or upon the change of control of Cohu. Any event that could require us to repay debt prior to its due date could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to comply with covenants contained in such debt agreements may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. Even if we are able to comply with all of the applicable covenants, the restrictions on our ability to manage our business in our sole discretion could adversely affect our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of financings, mergers, acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that we believe would be beneficial to us. In addition, our obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured, on a first-priority basis, and such security interests could be enforced in the event of default by the collateral agent for the Credit Agreement.\nChanges in the method of determining the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect interest rates.\nInterest rates under our Credit Agreement are calculated using LIBOR. On July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021 and it is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established. If LIBOR ceases to exist after 2021, a comparable or successor reference rate must be negotiated and agreed among the Administrative Agent, Cohu and certain lenders under the Credit Agreement. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a newly created index, calculated based on repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates in the United Kingdom, the United States or elsewhere. To the extent these interest rates increase, our interest expense will increase, which could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nCohu has total consolidated debt of $319.9 million as of December 26, 2020 and because of such high debt levels we may not be able to service our debt obligations in accordance with their terms; the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act severely limits the deductibility of interest expense.\nCohu\u2019s ability to meet its expense and debt service obligations contained in the Debt Financing agreements will depend on Cohu\u2019s future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, including potential changes in industry conditions, industry supply and demand balance, customer preferences, the success of Cohu\u2019s products, pressure from competitors, new product innovation and overall business execution. In addition, Cohu is subject to interest rate risks, and continuing increases in interest rates will increase Cohu\u2019s debt service obligations. If Cohu is ever unable to meet its debt service obligations or fail to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements governing its indebtedness, Cohu may be required to refinance all or part of its debt, sell important strategic assets at unfavorable prices, incur additional indebtedness or issue Cohu Common Stock or other equity securities. Cohu may not be able to, at any given time, refinance its debt, sell assets, incur additional indebtedness or issue equity securities on terms acceptable to Cohu, in amounts sufficient to meet Cohu\u2019s needs or at all. If Cohu is able to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or equity-linked securities, such issuance would also result in dilution to Cohu\u2019s stockholders. Cohu\u2019s inability to service its debt obligations or refinance its debt could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial conditions or operating results. In addition, Cohu\u2019s debt obligations may limit its ability to make required investments in capacity, technology or other areas of its business, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial conditions or operating results. Furthermore, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\") limits the deductibility of interest expense in a given year to 30% of adjusted taxable income, as defined; the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (\"CARES\") Act temporarily increased this limitation to 50% for 2019 and 2020. This resulted in the inability of Cohu to utilize a substantial portion of its interest expense deductions in 2018 and 2019. We were able to fully deduct the interest expense in 2020 plus the disallowed amounts carried over from 2018 and 2019, however, the Tax Acts may continue to impact our ability to utilize future deductions.\nDue to the nature of our business, we need continued access to capital, which if not available to us or if not available on favorable terms, could harm our ability to operate or expand our business.\nOur business requires capital to finance accounts receivable and product inventory that is not financed by trade creditors when our business is expanding. If cash from available sources is insufficient or cash is used for unanticipated needs, we may require additional capital sooner than anticipated.\nWe believe that our existing sources of liquidity, including cash resources and cash provided by operating activities will provide sufficient resources to meet our working capital and cash requirements for at least the next twelve months; however, a material adverse impact from COVID-19 or a desire to reduce our outstanding indebtedness could result in a need to raise additional capital. Alternatively, we could decide to raise capital or incur additional indebtedness to fund strategic initiatives or operating activities, particularly if we pursue additional acquisitions. In the event we are required, or elect, to raise additional funds, we may be unable to do so on favorable terms, or at all, and may incur expenses in raising the additional funds and increase our interest rate exposure, and any future indebtedness could adversely affect our operating results and severely limit our ability to plan for, or react to, changes in our business or industry. Further, under our Credit Agreement, we are significantly limited by financial and other negative covenants in our credit arrangements, including limitations on our borrowing of additional funds and issuing dividends. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements. Any inability to raise additional capital when required could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nThe issuance of shares of our common stock in connection with any future offerings of securities by us, will dilute our shareholders\u2019 ownership interest in the company.\nWe may seek additional financing in the future to meet our capital needs, to repay outstanding indebtedness under our existing Credit Agreement or to meet our strategic initiatives or operating activities. We have in the past issued common stock as acquisition consideration. For example, the Xcerra acquisition was financed in part by the issuance of additional shares of our common stock to shareholders of Xcerra, comprising approximately 11.8 million shares of common stock, or approximately 29% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock immediately after completing the transaction. We may determine to utilize common stock as acquisition consideration, issue convertible debt, or pursue a follow-on equity offering to raise capital for debt reduction or for other general corporate purposes, at any time in the future. Any issuances of additional shares of our common stock would dilute shareholders\u2019 ownership interest in our company, and shareholders would have a proportionately reduced ownership and voting interest in our company as a result of equity issuance. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt, we may be subject to limitations on our operations due to restrictive covenants. Additionally, our ability to make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors beyond our control.\nRisks Relating to Acquisitions and Other Strategic Transactions\nBecause a significant portion of Cohu\u2019s total assets are represented by goodwill, which is subject to mandatory impairment evaluation, and other intangibles, Cohu could be required to write off some or all of this goodwill and other intangibles, which may adversely affect the combined company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nCohu accounted for the acquisition of Xcerra using the purchase method of accounting. A portion of the purchase price for this business was allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities based on estimated fair values at the date of consummation of the merger. 45% of Cohu\u2019s total assets is comprised of goodwill and other intangibles, of which approximately $252.3 million is allocated to goodwill. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, goodwill and certain other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are reviewed at least annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications of impairment. Significant declines in the price of Cohu\u2019s common stock could increase the risk of an impairment. All other intangible assets are subject to periodic amortization. Cohu evaluates the remaining useful lives of other intangible assets each quarter to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. If we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits of the Xcerra acquisition, when Cohu performs future impairment tests, it is possible that the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets could exceed their implied fair value and therefore would require adjustment. Such adjustment would result in a charge to operating income in that period. For example, in first quarter 2020, and again in third quarter 2020, Cohu recorded impairment charges of approximately $3.9 million and $7.3 million, respectively, to adjust in-process research and development (\u201cIPR&D\u201d) assets obtained in the acquisition of Xcerra to their current fair value. There can be no assurance that there will not be further adjustments for impairment in future periods.\nWe are exposed to other risks associated with other acquisitions, investments and divestitures.\nAs part of our business strategy, we will continue to regularly evaluate investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies, and we expect that periodically we will continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future. For example, we acquired Xcerra Corporation in 2018 for total consideration of approximately $794.4 million. Acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf\nacquisitions may underperform and we may not achieve any forecasted growth, benefits or synergies;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties entering potentially new markets or manufacturing in new geographies where Cohu has no or limited direct prior experience;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties and increased costs in connection with integration of the personnel, operations, technologies and products of acquired businesses;\n\u25cf\nincreasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our business;\n\u25cf\nthe cost and risk of having to potentially develop new and unfamiliar sales channels for acquired businesses;\n\u25cf\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from other operational matters;\n\u25cf\nproduct manufacturing disruptions and delays as we potentially consolidate certain manufacturing sites;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties and significant costs in integrating the systems and processes of two companies with complex operations including multiple manufacturing sites;\n\u25cf\nthe potential loss of key employees, customers or suppliers of Cohu or acquired businesses;\n\u25cf\nlack of synergy, or the inability to realize expected synergies, resulting from the acquisition;\n\u25cf\npotential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses;\n\u25cf\nfailure to commercialize purchased technology;\n\u25cf\nthe impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill that could result in significant charges to operating results in future periods; and\n\u25cf\nchallenges caused by distance, language and cultural differences.\nWe may decide to finance future acquisitions and investments through a combination of borrowings, proceeds from equity or debt offerings and the use of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. If we finance acquisitions or investments by issuing equity-linked (such as convertible debt) or equity securities, our existing stockholders may be diluted which would likely affect the market price of our stock. For example, the Xcerra acquisition resulted in significant dilution as it was financed, in part, by the issuance of approximately 11.8 million shares of common stock, or approximately 29% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock immediately after completing the transaction. Mergers, acquisitions and investments are inherently risky and the inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe expect to continue to evaluate and pursue divestitures of non-core assets\nFurther, as a strategy to pay down our long-term debt, we expect to continue to evaluate and pursue divestitures of assets that management determines to be non-core to our overall business strategy. Any such divestitures may distract Cohu\u2019s management team, disrupt employees, may not yield attractive valuations, may incur material restructuring and transaction expenses and tax obligations, and may otherwise be unsuccessful. Divestitures may also involve warranties, indemnification or covenants that could restrict our business or result in litigation, additional expenses or liabilities. In addition, discontinuing product categories, even categories that we consider non-strategic, reduces the size and diversification of our business and causes us to be more dependent on a smaller number of product categories.\nRisks Relating to Owning Our Stock\nOur financial and operating results may vary and fall below analysts\u2019 estimates, or credit rating agencies may change their ratings on Cohu, any of which may cause the price of our common stock to decline or make it difficult to obtain other financing.\nOur operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf\nseasonal, volatile and unpredictable nature of the semiconductor equipment industry;\n\u25cf\ntiming and amount of orders from customers and shipments to customers;\n\u25cf\ncustomer decisions to cancel orders or push out deliveries;\n\u25cf\ninability to recognize revenue due to accounting requirements;\n\u25cf\ninventory write-downs;\n\u25cf\nunexpected expenses or cost overruns in the introduction and support of products;\n\u25cf\ninability to deliver solutions as expected by our customers;\n\u25cf\nintangible and deferred tax asset write-downs; and\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic and market conditions, including the global COVID-19 pandemic.\nDue to these factors or other unanticipated events, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be reliable indicators of our future performance. In addition, from time-to-time our quarterly financial results may fall below the expectations of the securities and industry analysts who publish reports on our company or of investors in general. This could cause the market price of our stock to decline, perhaps significantly.\nIn addition, as a result of the Credit Facility, we maintain credit ratings with Moody\u2019s Investors Service, Inc. (\u201cMoody\u2019s\u201d) and S&P Global Ratings (\u201cS&P\u201d). The current Moody\u2019s and S&P issuer credit ratings for Cohu are B2 and B-, respectively. Any future downgrade of Cohu\u2019s credit ratings or rating outlooks may materially and adversely affect the market price of our equity and the availability, cost or interest rate of other credit or financing. Cohu\u2019s current credit ratings are considered non-investment grade and make it more costly (as compared to investment grade borrowers) for Cohu or its subsidiaries to borrow money or enter into new credit facilities and to raise certain other types of capital and/or complete additional financings.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, and current and potential stockholders may lose confidence in our financial reporting.\nWe are required by the Securities and Exchange Commission to establish and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting that provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We are likewise required, on a quarterly basis, to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and to disclose any changes and material weaknesses in those internal controls. Although we believe that we have adequate internal controls in place at this time, we cannot be certain that, with significantly greater global complexity, we will be able to maintain adequate internal control over our financial reporting in future periods. Any failure to maintain such internal controls could adversely impact our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis. If our financial statements are not accurate, investors may not have a complete understanding of our operations. Likewise, if our financial statements are not filed on a timely basis as required by the Securities and Exchange Commission and Nasdaq Global Select Market, we could face severe consequences from those authorities. In either case, there could result a material adverse effect on our business. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock.\nWe have experienced significant volatility in our stock price.\nA variety of factors may cause the price of our stock to be volatile. The stock market in general, and the market for shares of high-technology companies in particular, including ours, have experienced extreme price fluctuations, which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. During the three-year period ended December 26, 2020, the price of our common stock has ranged from $41.00 to $8.89. The price of our stock may be more volatile than the stock of other companies due to, among other factors, the unpredictable, volatile and seasonal nature of the semiconductor industry, our significant customer concentration, intense competition in the test contactor, test handler, automated test equipment and PCB test industry, our limited backlog, our debt levels and high leverage, and our relatively low daily stock trading volume. The market price of our common stock is likely to continue to fluctuate significantly in the future, including fluctuations related and unrelated to our performance.\nWe may underperform relative to our expectations.\nOur business and financial performance are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, as described in these risk factors. We may not achieve our forecasted growth rates, levels of revenue, earnings, or operating efficiency that we expect and may incur losses in the business at any time. Any underperformance from our expectations or forecasts could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cause abrupt, significant stock price declines. Also, perceived company underperformance could attract shareholder activism and such activities could interfere with our ability to execute our business plans, be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations, divert the attention of management or result in other short-term focused corporate actions, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business or stock price.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law may make a takeover of Cohu more difficult.\nThere are provisions in our basic corporate documents and under Delaware law that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control, even if a change in control may be regarded as beneficial to some or all of our stockholders.\nRisks Relating to Regulatory Matters\nThere may be changes in, and uncertainty with respect to, legislation, regulation and governmental policy in the United States.\nThe change in administration in the United States in January 2021 may result in changes to, and uncertainty with respect to, legislation, regulation and government policy. Specific legislative and regulatory proposals that could have a material impact on us include, but are not limited to, infrastructure renewal programs, modifications to international trade policy, increased duties, tariffs or other export restrictions, public company reporting requirements, environmental regulation, corporate tax legislation, new employment and privacy laws, and antitrust enforcement.\nUnanticipated changes in our tax provisions, enactment of new tax laws, or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our tax liabilities are affected by, among other things, the amounts our affiliated entities charge each other for intercompany transactions. Our German subsidiaries income tax returns for 2015 to 2017, and our Philippines subsidiary income tax return for 2017 are currently under routine examination by tax authorities in their respective countries. Subsequent to December 26, 2020, we were notified by the taxing authority in Malaysia of its intent to perform an audit for 2014 to 2019 for one of our Malaysian subsidiaries. We may be subject to ongoing tax examinations in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges or other matters and assess additional taxes. While we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these examinations to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision, tax audits are inherently uncertain, and an unfavorable outcome could occur. An unanticipated, unfavorable outcome in any specific period could harm our operating results for that period or future periods. The financial cost and management attention and time devoted to defending income tax positions may divert resources from our business operations, which could harm our business and profitability. Tax examinations may also impact the timing and/or amount of our refund claims. In addition, our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process. In particular, the carrying value of our deferred tax assets and the utilization of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards are dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the U.S. and other countries. Furthermore, these carryforwards may be subject to annual limitations as a result of changes in Cohu\u2019s ownership. As a result of the acquisition of Xcerra, a greater than 50% cumulative ownership change in Xcerra triggered a significant limitation in the utilization of their net operating loss and research credit carryforwards. Cohu\u2019s ability to use the acquired Xcerra U.S. net operating loss and credit carryforwards is subject to annual limitations as defined in sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code.\nCompliance with regulations may impact sales to foreign customers and impose costs.\nCertain products and services that we offer require compliance with U.S. and other foreign country export and other regulations. Compliance with complex U.S. and other foreign country laws and regulations that apply to our international sales activities increases our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions and could expose us or our employees to fines and penalties. These laws and regulations include import and export requirements, the U.S. State Department International Traffic in Arms Regulations (\u201cITAR\u201d) and U.S. and other foreign country laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate our policies, or that our policies will be effective in preventing all potential violations. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services to one or more countries, and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results. Further, defending against claims of violations of these laws and regulations, even if we are successful, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, divert management\u2019s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses.\nIn addition to government regulations regarding sale and export, we are subject to other regulations regarding our products. For example, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted disclosure rules for companies that use conflict minerals in their products, with substantial supply chain verification requirements if the materials come from, or could have come from, the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries. These new rules and verification requirements impose additional costs on us and on our suppliers and may limit the sources or increase the cost of materials used in our products. Further, if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict free, we may face challenges with our customers that could place us at a competitive disadvantage, and our reputation may be harmed.\nGlobal economic and political conditions, including trade tariffs and export restrictions, have impacted our business and may continue to have an impact on our business and financial condition.\nIn fiscal year 2020, 83% of our revenue was from products shipped to customer locations outside the United States. We also purchase a significant portion of components and subassemblies from suppliers outside the United States. Additionally, a significant portion of our facilities are located outside the United States, including China, Germany, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Switzerland and Taiwan.\nThere have been significant changes in U.S. export regulations relating to China since 2019. In May 2019, the Bureau of Industry and Security (\u201cBIS\u201d) of the U.S. Department of Commerce added Huawei to the BIS\u2019s Entity List, which imposes limitations on the supply of certain U.S. items and product support to Huawei (all references to Huawei include its wholly-owned subsidiary HiSilicon). Subsequently, in May 2020 and August 2020, BIS announced rules which amended the foreign-produced direct product rule and the Entity List to target Huawei\u2019s acquisition of Huawei-designed and subsequently third-party semiconductors that are the direct product of certain U.S.-origin software and technology. Also, as of June 2020, the BIS requires exporters to obtain a license for specified items if at the time of the export they had knowledge that the item was intended to support Chinese \u201cmilitary end users,\u201d in addition to \u201cmilitary end uses.\u201d\nCohu has evaluated the foregoing regulations, and at this time, despite an ongoing material adverse impact on direct and indirect Huawei sales, we have not seen any overall material impact to our business. However, we believe that these collective export restrictions and the ongoing unpredictability of U.S.-China trade relations have encouraged China-based companies to actively seek to obtain a greater supply of similar or substitute products from our foreign competitors that are not subject to these restrictions, thereby decreasing our long-term competitiveness as a supplier to China-based companies. Recent history indicates that the U.S. government may impose other new export restrictions, or tariffs, without prior notice impacting our ability (or our customers\u2019 ability) to sell and ship products to China-based companies and any such additional restrictions may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. In addition, the change in administration in the United States in January 2021 may result in changes to, and uncertainty with respect to, trade tariffs and export restrictions. Any such changes may have a further adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nAny failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could subject us to significant fines and liabilities, and new laws and regulations (such as involving climate change) or changes in regulatory interpretation or enforcement could make compliance more difficult and costly.\nWe are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local, and foreign governmental laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the cleanup of contaminated sites and the maintenance of a safe workplace. We could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, civil or criminal fines or sanctions and third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations or non-compliance with the environmental permits required at our facilities. In addition, new regulations or public expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased energy, transportation and raw material costs, and may require us to make additional investments in facilities and equipment. As a result, the effects of climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Cybersecurity, the Economy, and Litigation\nOur business and operations could suffer in the event of cybersecurity breaches.\nAttempts by others to gain unauthorized access to information technology systems are becoming more sophisticated and are sometimes successful. These attempts, which might be related to industrial or other espionage, include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks and impersonating authorized users, among others. We seek to detect and investigate all cybersecurity incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. We have been impacted by immaterial \u201cphishing\u201d schemes and we are continuing our efforts to train employees on such risks but may still incur damages from such schemes in the future. We believe that extensive employee telework practices, implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, have increased our cybersecurity risks. The theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business. To the extent that any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our customers\u2019 or licensees\u2019 confidential information, we may incur liability as a result. Further, in late 2020, a global cyberbreach, widely reported as the \u201cSolarWinds\u201d hack, occurred and caused significant disruption at one of our suppliers and as a result created delays in our operation. Any future attacks that disrupt our IT systems, or those of our suppliers, could impact our sales, financial results and stock price. In response to these risks, we expect to continue to devote additional resources to the security of our information technology systems.\nThe occurrence of natural disasters, health epidemics, and geopolitical instability caused by terrorist attacks and other threats may adversely impact our operations and sales.\nOur corporate headquarters is located in San Diego, California, our Asian sales and service headquarters are located in Singapore and Taiwan, and the majority of our sales are made to destinations in Asia. In addition, we have Asia-based manufacturing plants in Malaysia, Philippines and Japan. These regions are known for being vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, fires and floods, volcanic eruptions, and geopolitical risks, which at times have disrupted the local economies. For example, a significant earthquake or tsunami could materially affect operating results. We are not insured for most losses and business interruptions of this kind, or for geopolitical or terrorism impacts, and presently have limited redundant, multiple site capacity in the event of a disaster. In the event of such disaster, our business would materially suffer.\nOur business could also be adversely affected by the effects of a widespread outbreak of contagious diseases, and has been and is continuing to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 global pandemic (see risk factor entitled \u201cThe ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and is continuing to adversely affect, our business, financial condition and results of operations\u201d).\nGlobal economic conditions may have an impact on our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict.\nOur operations and financial results depend on worldwide economic conditions and their impact on levels of business spending. Continued uncertainties may reduce future sales of our products and services. While we believe we have a strong customer base and have experienced strong collections in the past, if the current market conditions deteriorate, we may experience increased collection times and greater write-offs, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow.\nIn addition, the tightening of credit markets and concerns regarding the availability of credit may make it more difficult for our customers to raise capital, whether debt or equity, to finance their purchases of capital equipment, including the products we sell.
