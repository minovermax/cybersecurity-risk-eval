RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider each of the risks and uncertainties described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as any amendments or updates reflected in subsequent filings with the SEC. We believe these risks and uncertainties, individually or in the aggregate, could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results and could materially and adversely affect our business operations, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to the Integrated Mergers\nOn August 24, 2016, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Berry, Holdings, Merger Sub and Merger Sub LLC, pursuant to which, among other things, the Integrated Mergers will occur. In connection with the proposed Integrated Mergers, we are subject to certain risks including, but not limited to, those set forth below. For additional information related to the Merger Agreement, refer to the definitive proxy statement/prospectus filed with the SEC on December 15, 2016. The description of each of the Merger Agreement and the Merger Agreement Amendment herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement and Merger Agreement Amendment included in Annex A to the definitive proxy statement/prospectus.\nCompletion of the Integrated Mergers is subject to various conditions which, if not satisfied, may cause the Integrated Mergers not to be completed in a timely manner or at all.\nThe completion of the Integrated Mergers is subject to certain conditions, including, among others, (i) the approval by the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote on the Integrated Mergers to adopt the Merger Agreement pursuant to which the Company\u2019s stockholders would be entitled to receive, at the holder\u2019s election, $110.00 in cash (the \u201cCash Consideration\u201d) or 2.5011 shares of Berry common stock (the \u201cStock Consideration\u201d and together with the Cash Consideration, the \u201cMerger Consideration\u201d) in exchange for each share of the Company\u2019s common stock (the \u201cbase merger consideration\u201d), subject to the proration mechanics in the Merger Agreement, which will result in the Company merging with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of Berry (the \u201cbase merger consideration proposal\u201d), unless Berry has made the Alternative Funding Election (as defined below) and the Alternative Funding Election Period (as defined in the Merger Agreement) is not yet complete; (ii) in the event that Berry has made the Alternative Funding Election and the Alternative Funding Election Period is not yet complete, in which event the approval by the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote on the Integrated Mergers to adopt the Merger Agreement pursuant to which, in certain limited circumstances (as specified in the Merger Agreement) Berry may elect, in its sole discretion, to pay $110.00 in cash for each share of the Company\u2019s common stock (the \u201calternative merger consideration\u201d), subject to certain conditions, which will result, in those circumstances and subject to those conditions, in the Company merging with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of Berry (the \u201calternative merger consideration proposal\u201d); (iii) the expiration or early termination of the waiting period applicable to the consummation of the Integrated Mergers under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the \u201cHSR Act\u201d); (iv) the absence of any law, injunction, judgment or ruling restraining, enjoining, preventing or prohibiting the consummation of the Integrated Mergers; (v) no governmental authority having instituted any legal proceeding (which remains pending) seeking to restrain, enjoin, prevent or prohibit the Integrated Mergers; (vi) unless Berry has made the Alternative Funding Election (as defined in the Merger Agreement), a registration statement on Form S-4 will have been declared effective by the SEC in accordance with the provisions of the Securities Act, and no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Form S-4 shall have been issued by the SEC and remain in effect and no proceedings to that effect shall have been commenced or threatened by the SEC; and (vii) unless Berry has made the Alternative Funding Election, the shares of Berry common stock to be issued in the Integrated Mergers will have been approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange,\nsubject only to official notice of issuance. On November 2, 2016, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission notified Berry and the Company that early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, was granted, effective immediately. Therefore, the closing condition to the Integrated Mergers in the Merger Agreement relating to the expiration or termination of the waiting period applicable to the Integrated Mergers under the HSR Act has been satisfied. Furthermore, on December 15, 2016, the SEC declared the registration statement on Form S-4 effective, and the Company first mailed its definitive proxy statement/prospectus to its stockholders on December 16, 2016.\nEach party\u2019s obligation to consummate the Integrated Mergers is subject to certain other conditions, including without limitation (a) the accuracy of the other party\u2019s representations and warranties, (b) the other party\u2019s material compliance with its covenants and agreements contained in the Merger Agreement, (c) there having not been since the date of the Merger Agreement a material adverse effect with respect to Company or Berry and (d) each of the Company and Berry having received written opinions from certain specified parties that the Integrated Mergers will qualify as a tax-free reorganization for United States federal income tax purposes. However, in the event of a material adverse effect with respect to Berry or if the written tax opinion required to be delivered to the Company in connection with the Integrated Mergers cannot be delivered, Berry may elect, in its sole discretion, to pay $110.00 in cash for each share of the Company\u2019s common stock, subject to certain conditions. If the Integrated Mergers are not consummated on or before February 24, 2017, either party may terminate the Merger Agreement. As a result of these conditions, we cannot provide assurance that the Integrated Mergers will be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, or at all.\nWe will continue to incur substantial transaction-related costs in connection with the Integrated Mergers.\nWe have incurred significant legal, advisory and financial services fees in connection with our Board of Directors\u2019 review of strategic alternatives and the process of negotiating and evaluating the terms of the Integrated Mergers. We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, additional costs in connection with the satisfaction of the various conditions to closing, including seeking approval from our stockholders and from applicable regulatory agencies. Such costs were significant in fiscal 2016 and, subject to the timing of closing of the Integrated Mergers, may be significant in fiscal 2017.\nThe pendency of the Integrated Mergers could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe pendency of the Integrated Mergers could cause disruptions in and create uncertainty surrounding our business, including affecting our relationships with our existing and future customers, suppliers and employees, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and internal controls, regardless of whether the Integrated Mergers are completed. In particular, we could potentially lose important personnel as a result of the departure of employees who decide to pursue other opportunities in light of the Integrated Mergers. We could also potentially lose customers or suppliers, and new customer or supplier contracts could be delayed or decrease. In addition, we have expended, and continue to expend, significant management resources in an effort to complete the Integrated Mergers, which are being diverted from our day-to-day operations.\nIf the Integrated Mergers are not completed and we do not complete a Superior Proposal (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement), our stock price will likely fall to the extent that the current market price of our common stock reflects an assumption that the Integrated Mergers will be completed. In addition, the failure to complete the Integrated Mergers may result in negative publicity and/or a negative impression of us in the investment community, may affect our relationship with employees, customers and other partners in the business community and our industry, and may cause Berry to retain knowledge that could be detrimental to the Company\u2019s business and competitive position.\nWhile the Merger Agreement is in effect, we are subject to restrictions on our business activities and our pursuit of strategic alternatives.\nUnder the Merger Agreement, we are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our business and generally must operate our business in the ordinary course in all material respects prior to completing the Integrated Mergers unless we obtain the consent of Berry, which may restrict our ability to exercise certain of our business strategies. These restrictions may prevent us from entering into any new line of business outside of our existing businesses or existing business plans, making certain investments or acquisitions, selling assets, hiring or promoting key personnel, entering into or amending contractual relationships, engaging in capital expenditures in excess of certain agreed limits, incurring indebtedness or making changes to our business prior to the completion of the Integrated Mergers or termination of the Merger Agreement. These restrictions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the Merger Agreement also restricts our ability to solicit alternative acquisition proposals from third parties and to provide information to, and participate in discussions and engage in negotiations with, third parties regarding alternative acquisition proposals. However, prior to approval of the Integrated Mergers by our stockholders, the solicitation restrictions are subject to a customary \u201cfiduciary-out\u201d provision, which allows us, under certain circumstances, to provide information to, and participate in discussions and engage in negotiations with, third parties with respect to an unsolicited alternative acquisition proposal that our Board of Directors has determined is or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal. In addition, we will be required to pay Berry a termination fee equal to $20 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, including by us to enter into an acquisition agreement that constitutes a Superior Proposal or because our Board of Directors adversely changes its recommendation to stockholders to vote in favor of the Integrated Mergers or takes certain other related adverse actions. We also would be required to pay Berry a termination fee equal to $20 million if the Merger Agreement is terminated due to either the failure to obtain approval of our stockholders or the conditions to close were not satisfied before the end date of February 24, 2017, and an alternative acquisition proposal is consummated within 12 months of the termination, subject to certain conditions. These provisions limit our ability to pursue offers from third parties that could result in greater value to our stockholders than the value resulting from the Integrated Mergers. The termination fee may also discourage third parties from pursuing an alternative acquisition proposal with respect to us.\nBecause the market value of Berry\u2019s common stock that our stockholders may receive in the Integrated Mergers may fluctuate, our stockholders cannot be sure of the market value of the stock portion of the consideration that they will receive in the Integrated Mergers.\nThe stock portion of the Merger Consideration that some of our stockholders will receive is a fixed number of shares of Berry common stock, not a number of shares that will be determined based on a fixed market value. The market value of Berry common stock and our common stock at the effective time of the Integrated Mergers may vary significantly from their respective values on the date that the Merger Agreement was executed or at other dates, such as the date on which our stockholders vote on the approval of the Merger Agreement. Stock price changes may result from a variety of factors, including changes in Berry\u2019s and our respective businesses, operations or prospects, regulatory considerations, and general business, market, industry or economic conditions. The exchange ratio relating to the stock portion of the Merger Consideration will not be adjusted to reflect any changes in the market value of Berry common stock or our common stock.\nIf the Integrated Mergers are completed, the combined company may not be able to successfully integrate our business with Berry and therefore may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits of the Integrated Mergers.\nBecause a portion of the Merger Consideration consists of Berry common stock, realization of the anticipated benefits in the Integrated Mergers will depend, in part, on the combined company\u2019s ability\nto successfully integrate our business with Berry. The combined company will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating its business practices and support functions. The diversion of management\u2019s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the Integrated Mergers and the integration of the two companies\u2019 operations could have an adverse effect on the business, financial results, financial condition or stock price of Berry (including the combined company following the Integrated Mergers). The integration process may also result in additional and unforeseen expenses and loss of customers and suppliers. There can be no assurance that the contemplated synergies anticipated from the Integrated Mergers will be realized.\nAfter the completion of the Integrated Mergers, sales of Berry common stock may negatively affect its market price.\nThe shares of Berry common stock to be issued in the Integrated Mergers to our stockholders will generally be eligible for immediate resale. The market price of Berry common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of Berry common stock in the market after the completion of the Integrated Mergers or the perception in the market that these sales could occur.\nWe may be the target of securities class action and derivative lawsuits which could result in substantial costs and may delay or prevent the Integrated Mergers from being completed.\nSecurities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits are often brought against companies that have entered into merger agreements. Even if the lawsuits are without merit, defending against these claims can result in substantial costs to us and divert management time and resources. Additionally, if a plaintiff is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting consummation of the Integrated Mergers, then that injunction may delay or prevent the Integrated Mergers from being completed, which may materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial position and results of operations.\nIndustry Risks\nOur business is dependent on the price and availability of resin, our principal raw material, and our ability to manage resin price volatility and resin availability.\nThe primary raw materials that we use in our products are polyethylene (\u201cPE\u201d) and polyvinyl chloride (\u201cPVC\u201d) resins. Our ability to operate profitably is dependent, in a large part, on the markets for these resins. These resins are derived from petroleum and natural gas, and therefore prices of such resins fluctuate substantially as a result of changes in petroleum and natural gas prices, demand and the capacity of resin suppliers. Instability in the world markets for petroleum and natural gas could adversely affect the prices of our raw materials and their general availability. During the past several years, we have experienced significant fluctuations in resin prices, including periods of rapidly increasing resin prices. This significant volatility in resin prices within and between consecutive periods creates instability in customer purchasing and may have a material impact on our pounds of product sold, revenue and profitability. During periods of price increases, there can be no assurance that we will be able to pass on resin price increases in full or on a timely basis, shorten the time lag in adjusting sell prices, win in a competitive bid process or have enough product to allocate to customers desiring to increase their inventory levels. See Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d for a further discussion of the impact of resin costs on results of operations in fiscal 2016.\nOur ability to maintain profitability during periods of resin price increases is heavily dependent upon our ability to pass through to our customers the full amount of any price increases on a timely basis. Since resin costs fluctuate significantly, selling prices are determined generally as a \u201cspread\u201d over resin costs, usually expressed as cents per pound. The historical increases and decreases in resin costs have generally been reflected over a period of time in the sales prices of the products on a penny-for-penny basis. Assuming a constant volume of sales, an increase in resin costs would,\ntherefore, result in increased sales revenues but lower gross profit as a percentage of sales or gross profit margin, while a decrease in resin costs would result in lower sales revenues with a higher gross profit margin. Further, the gap between the time at which an order is taken, resin is purchased, production occurs and shipment is made, has an impact on our financial results and our working capital needs. In periods of rising resin prices, this impact is generally negative to operating results and in periods of declining resin prices, the impact is generally positive to operating results. If there is overcapacity of, or significant competition of comparable quality in any specific product that we manufacture and sell, we frequently are not able to pass through the full amount of any cost increase and we may be required to participate in a re-bid process for future business.\nIntense competition in the flexible packaging markets may adversely affect our operating results.\nThe business of supplying flexible plastic packaging products is extremely competitive and the general economic environment in recent years has only intensified an already competitive marketplace. The competition in our market is highly price sensitive; we also compete on the basis of quality, service, timely delivery and product differentiation, development and availability. We face intense competition from numerous private and public companies, including from local manufacturers that specialize in the extrusion of a limited group of products, which they market nationally, and a limited number of manufacturers of flexible packaging products that offer a broad range of products and maintain production and marketing facilities domestically and internationally. Certain of our competitors may have more efficient production facilities (including more advanced technologies), well-developed sales and marketing staffs and greater financial resources than we do. We believe that there are few barriers to entry into many of our product markets. Many of these competitors have also undertaken significant capital expenditures projects in recent years in anticipation of increased domestic resin production and lower supply costs. As a result, we may not achieve future anticipated benefits from resin supply changes to the same extent as some of our competitors. Further, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, competition from new manufacturers. When new manufacturers enter the market for a flexible plastic packaging product or existing manufacturers increase capacity, they frequently reduce prices to achieve increased market share. In addition, we compete with other packaging product manufacturers, many of which can offer consumers non-plastic packaging solutions. Many of these competitors have greater financial resources than we do, and such competition can result in additional pricing pressures, reduced sales and lower margins.\nPolyethylene resin is expected to undergo a major growth phase in the United States. Availability of welders, pipefitters and other specialty labor and a variety of other reasons could delay the production of such new capacity, none of which we influence or control. If any such projects are significantly delayed or cancelled, we could have excess capacity and may not achieve our expected return on investment of our significant capital expenditures in the last five fiscal years. Further, excess capacity in our industry could result in further pricing pressures in our industry that would have a material and adverse impact on our operations, results of operations and financial condition.\nAn increase in competition could result in material reductions in margins or loss of our market share, which could materially adversely affect our operations and financial condition. In recent years, we have varied on focusing on maintaining margins which has negatively impacted sales volume, and focusing on maintaining market share, which has negatively affected margins. In addition, since we do not have long-term arrangements with many of our customers, these competitive factors could cause our customers to shift suppliers and/or products quickly. Further, we believe intense competition in the industry has precluded us from implementing non-resin price increases to counter rising costs in labor, healthcare costs and packaging, which have negatively impacted our results in recent years. Certain consolidation of our customers has also resulted in customers having greater purchasing power. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the markets for our products or that competition will not intensify.\nWe are subject to various environmental and health and safety laws and regulations that govern our operations and that may result in potential liability. In addition, consumer preferences and ongoing health and safety studies on plastics and resins may adversely affect our business.\nOur operations are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations which govern:\n\u2022\ndischarges into the air and water;\n\u2022\nthe storage, handling and disposal of solid and hazardous substances and waste;\n\u2022\nthe remediation of soil and ground water contaminated by petroleum products or hazardous substances or waste; and\n\u2022\nthe health and safety of our employees.\nCompliance with these laws and regulations may require material expenditures by us. Actions by federal, state, local and foreign governments concerning environmental and health and safety matters could result in laws or regulations that could increase the cost of manufacturing our products. In addition, the nature of our current and former operations and the history of industrial uses at some of our manufacturing facilities expose us to the risk of liabilities or claims with respect to environmental and worker health and safety matters. We may also be exposed to claims for contamination or violations of environmental laws and regulations arising from the actions of previous owners or operators of our property. Such liability may be imposed without regard to fault, and under certain circumstances, can be joint and several, resulting in one party being held responsible for the entire obligation. In addition, the presence of, or failure to remediate, hazardous substances or waste may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent any property or to use it as collateral for a loan. We also may be liable for costs relating to the investigation, remediation or removal of waste and hazardous substances from a disposal or treatment facility to which we or our predecessors sent waste or hazardous substances. We have limited insurance coverage for potential environmental liabilities associated with historic and current operations and we do not anticipate increasing such coverage in the future. We may also assume, or be deemed to assume, significant environmental liabilities in acquisitions, although we will not pursue acquisitions while the Integrated Mergers are pending.\nWhile we have not been required historically to make significant capital expenditures in order to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations, we cannot predict with any certainty our future capital expenditure requirements because of continually changing compliance standards and environmental technology. Furthermore, violations or contaminated sites that we do not know about, including contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites, or at sites formerly owned or operated by us or our predecessors in connection with discontinued operations, could result in additional compliance or remediation costs or other liabilities, which could be material.\nAdditionally, a decline in consumer preference for plastic products due to environmental considerations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, a number of governmental authorities in the United States and abroad, have considered, or are expected to consider, legislation aimed at reducing the amount of plastic wastes disposed. Programs have included, for example, mandating certain rates of recycling and/or the use of recycled materials, imposing deposits or taxes on flexible plastic packaging material and requiring retailers or manufacturers to take back packaging used for their products. Governmental, as well as voluntary initiatives similarly aimed at reducing the level of plastic wastes, could reduce the demand for certain flexible plastic packaging, result in greater costs for flexible plastic packaging manufacturers or otherwise negatively impact our business. Some consumer products companies, including some of our customers, have responded to these initiatives and to perceived environmental concerns of consumers by using containers made in whole or in part of recycled plastic, which we do not manufacture. Future legislation and initiatives could adversely affect us in a manner that would be material.\nAlso, continuing studies of potential health and safety effects of various resins and plastics, including polyvinyl chlorides and other materials that we use in our products, are being conducted by industry groups, government agencies and others. The results of these studies, along with the development of any other new information, may adversely affect our ability to market and sell certain of our products or may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured by such products, any of which could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nThe Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) regulates the material content of direct-contact food and drug packages we manufacture pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Furthermore, some of our products are regulated by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (\u201cCPSC\u201d) pursuant to various federal laws, including the Consumer Product Safety Act and the Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Both the FDA and the CPSC can require the manufacturer of defective products to repurchase or recall these products and may also impose fines or penalties on the manufacturer. Similar laws exist in some states, cities and other countries in which we sell products. In addition, laws exist in certain states restricting the sale of packaging with certain levels of heavy metals and imposing fines and penalties for noncompliance. Although we use FDA-approved resins and pigments in our products that directly contact food and drug products and we believe our products are in material compliance with all applicable requirements, we remain subject to the risk that our products could be found not to be in compliance with these and other requirements. A recall of any of our products or any fines and penalties imposed in connection with non-compliance could have a materially adverse effect on our operations, results of operations and financial condition.\nCompany Risks\nDisruptions in the global economic and financial market environment may have a negative effect on our business and operations.\nOur customers, distributors and suppliers represent a cross-section of the general economy and therefore we are significantly impacted by the global economic and financial markets. In recent years, we have lost volume due to foreign imports, customer bankruptcies and loss of bids due to pricing. Disruptions in the global economy and volatility in the financial markets could cause, among other things, lower levels of liquidity, increased borrowing rates, increased rates of default and bankruptcy, lower consumer and business spending, and lower consumer net worth, all of which may have a negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Customers, distributors and suppliers may be negatively affected by the ongoing impacts of the economic and financial market difficulties. Current or potential customers and suppliers may no longer be in business, may be unable to fund purchases or may determine to reduce purchases, all of which could lead to reduced demand for our products, reduced gross margins and increased customer payment delays or defaults. Further, suppliers may not be able to supply us with needed raw materials on a timely basis, may increase prices or may go out of business, which could result in our inability to meet consumer demand or affect our gross margins. We are also limited in our ability to reduce costs to offset the results of a prolonged or severe economic downturn given certain fixed costs associated with our operations, difficulties if we overstrained our resources, and our long-term business approach that necessitates we remain in position to respond when market conditions improve. Future weakness in the global economy could adversely affect our operations and financial condition in future periods.\nSee \u201c-Financial Risks\u201d below for a discussion of additional risks to our liquidity resulting from the economic and financial market environment.\nThe loss of a key supplier could lead to increased costs, lower profit margins and short-term production issues\nThe majority of the resins purchased by us are purchased under supply contracts which are typically renewed annually. In fiscal 2016, we purchased approximately 28%, 22% and 13% of our\nresin requirements from our three largest suppliers. Each of these suppliers produces resins in multiple locations, and should any one, or a combination of these locations fail to meet our needs, we believe sufficient capacity exists among our remaining contract holders, the open market and the secondary markets to supply any shortfall that may result. Nevertheless, it is not always possible to replace a specialty resin without a disruption in our operations and replacement of significant supply is often at higher prices, and such impact may materially and adversely harm our competitive position.\nWe negotiate and award our supply contracts annually. The resin contracts generally serve to establish the basic terms and conditions between the parties, including rebates based on the volume of resin purchases, but do not bind us in a materially significant way. Should any of our existing relationships fail to bid or survive the bid process, the position previously enjoyed by that contract holder typically migrates to another supplier. While this process has served us well in the past, there is no guarantee that the future replacement of any supplier will always result in a more effective and efficient relationship in the future.\nWe have limited contractual relationships with our customers and, as a result, our customers may unilaterally reduce the purchase of our products. The loss of several customers could, in the aggregate, materially adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nA substantial portion of our business is in the merchant market, in which we do not have long-term contractual relationships with our customers. As a result, our customers may unilaterally reduce the purchase of our products or, in certain cases, terminate existing orders for which we may have incurred significant production costs. The loss of several customers could, in the aggregate, materially adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nMany of our larger packaging customers are multinational companies that purchase large quantities of packaging materials, some of whom have recently consolidated. Many of these companies are purchasers with centralized procurement departments. They generally enter into supply arrangements through a tender process of soliciting bids from several potential suppliers and selecting the winning bid based on several attributes, including price and service. The significant negotiating leverage possessed by many of our customers and potential customers limits our ability to negotiate supply arrangements with favorable terms and creates pricing pressure, reducing margins industry wide. In addition, our customers may vary their order levels significantly from period to period, and customers may not continue to place orders with us in the future at the same levels as in prior periods. In the event we lose any of our larger customers, we may not be able to quickly replace that revenue source or replace with not as good pricing, which could harm our financial results.\nLoss of third-party transportation providers upon whom we depend or increases in fuel prices could increase our costs or cause a disruption in our operations.\nWe depend generally upon third-party transportation providers for delivery of our products to our customers. Strikes, slowdowns, transportation disruptions or other conditions in the transportation industry, including, but not limited to, shortages of truck drivers, disruptions in rail service, decreases in the availability of vessels or increases in fuel prices, could increase our costs and disrupt our operations and our ability to service our customers on a timely basis.\nWe may, from time to time, experience problems in our labor relations.\nUnions represent 479 employees, or 18% of our workforce, at October 31, 2016, under three collective bargaining agreements which expire in March 2017, December 2018 and January 2020, respectively. Although we believe that our present labor relations with our employees are satisfactory, our failure to renew these agreements on reasonable terms could result in labor disruptions and increased labor costs, which could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe cannot assure you that our relations with the unionized portion of our workforce will remain positive or that such employees will not initiate a strike, work stoppage or slowdown in the future. In the event of such an action, our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected and we cannot assure you that we would be able to adequately meet the needs of our customers using our remaining workforce. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will not have similar actions with our non-unionized workforce or that our non-unionized workforce will not become unionized in the future.\nWe are dependent on the management experience of our key personnel and our ability to attract and retain additional personnel.\nPending the completion of the Integrated Mergers, our future success depends to a large extent on the experience, business relationships and continued service of our key managerial employees, including J. Brendan Barba, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Paul M. Feeney, our Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer, both of whom are also directors. Although the Company significantly benefits from the 74 years of combined service of Messrs. Barba and Feeney, any failure to ensure effective transfer of institutional knowledge and to implement a well-run succession plan could hinder our strategic planning and growth upon their termination of employment. We do not maintain key-person insurance for any of our officers. We may not be able to retain our executive officers and key personnel or attract additional qualified key employees in the future. Competition for qualified employees is intense, and the loss of such persons, or an inability to attract, retain and motivate additional highly skilled employees, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and prospects. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our existing personnel or attract and retain additional qualified employees.\nOur executive officers beneficially own a substantial amount of our common stock and have significant influence over our business.\nAt October 31, 2016, our executive officers beneficially owned 1,118,893 shares of our common stock, representing 22% of our outstanding shares as of such date. Their ownership and voting control, together with their duties as executive officers and directors, gives them significant influence on the outcome of corporate transactions or other matters submitted to the Board of Directors or stockholders for approval, including acquisitions, mergers, consolidations, substantial asset sales and director elections. In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Berry entered into voting agreements with certain stockholders of the Company, including our executive officers and certain of their relatives, which generally require, subject to certain exceptions, such stockholders to vote, or cause or direct to be voted, all of the shares of common stock beneficially owned by them in favor of adoption of the Merger Agreement and the Integrated Mergers and against matters that would be reasonably be expected to materially impede, interfere with, delay or postpone any of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nOur business is subject to risks associated with manufacturing our own products.\nWe internally manufacture our own products at our production facilities. While we maintain insurance covering our manufacturing and production facilities, including business interruption insurance, a catastrophic loss of the use of all or a portion of our facilities due to accident, fire, explosion, labor or other employee issues, weather conditions, other natural disaster or otherwise, whether short or long-term, could have a material adverse effect on us.\nUnexpected failures of our equipment and machinery may result in production delays, loss of customers and revenues, reduced product quality, significant repair costs, injuries to our employees, and customer claims. Any interruption in production capability may require us to make large capital expenditures to remedy the situation, which could have a negative impact on our profitability and\nfinancial condition. Our business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to offset the lost revenues or increased costs that we may experience during a disruption of our operations and our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed. In addition, the installation of new equipment and machinery is expensive and complex, may require various restructuring of existing facilities and the incapacity of certain manufacturing lines, and new equipment may not operate as anticipated. If there is a delay in installing new equipment or machinery, or new automation or other projects are unsuccessful, our operations or results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions to our information technology networks and systems could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, disrupt operations, and reduce the benefits of our investment in cloud computing and other advanced technologies.\nWe depend on information technology to record and process Company and customer transactions, inventory control, purchasing and supply chain management, payroll and human resources, and financial reporting, including significant proprietary and sensitive data of the Company and our business partners and personally identifiable information of our employees. The Company\u2019s information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof, power outages, acts of sabotage, hardware failures, computer viruses, telecommunication failures, user errors or catastrophic events. Failure to effectively prevent, detect and recover from system failures, viruses, security breaches or other cyber incidents could significantly disrupt our operations, result in lost or misappropriated information, and adversely affect our internal control over financial reporting and our ability to timely and accurately report financial results.\nIncreasingly, we are relying on third parties to provide software, support and management with respect to a variety of business processes and activities as part of our information technology network, and we are utilizing cloud computing through certain of our third-party vendors. The security and privacy measures we and our vendors implement are critical to our business, our key relationships, and compliance with applicable law. Despite security measures and business continuity plans, our information technology networks may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers, natural disasters or catastrophic events, or breaches due to errors or malfeasance by employees, contractors and others who have access to our networks and systems. The occurrence of any of these events could compromise our networks and the information stored therein could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, disrupt operations, and reduce the benefits of our investment in cloud computing and other advanced technologies. Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all of the costs and liabilities related to significant security and privacy violations.\nWe may not be successful in protecting our intellectual property rights, including our unpatented proprietary know-how and trade secrets, or in avoiding claims that we infringed on the intellectual property rights of others.\nIn addition to relying on patent and trademark rights, we rely on unpatented proprietary know-how and trade secrets, and employ various methods, including confidentiality agreements with employees and consultants, customers and suppliers to protect our know-how and trade secrets. However, these methods and our patents and trademarks may not afford complete protection and there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop the know-how and trade secrets or develop better production methods than us. Further, we may not be able to deter current and former employees, contractors and other parties from breaching confidentiality agreements and misappropriating proprietary information and it is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our information and proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our intellectual\nproperty rights. Additionally, we have licensed, and may license in the future, patents, trademarks, trade secrets, and similar proprietary rights to third parties. While we attempt to ensure that our intellectual property and similar proprietary rights are protected when entering into business relationships, third parties may take actions that could materially and adversely affect our rights or the value of our intellectual property, similar proprietary rights or reputation. In the future, we may also rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights and contractual rights, and, if not successful, we may not be able to protect the value of our intellectual property. Any litigation could be protracted and costly and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations regardless of its outcome.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain, or license from third parties, patents, trademarks, trade secrets and similar proprietary rights without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties. Although we believe our intellectual property rights are sufficient to allow us to conduct our business without incurring liability to third parties, our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of such persons. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that we will not be subject to claims asserting the infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties seeking damages, the payment of royalties or licensing fees and/or injunctions against the sale of our products. Any such litigation could be protracted and costly and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties.\nIn each of fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, approximately 60% of our worldwide sales were directly to distributors. Using third parties for distribution exposes us to many risks, including competitive pressure, concentration, credit risk and compliance risks. Distributors may sell products that compete with our products, and we may need to provide financial incentives to focus distributors on the sale of our products. We may rely on one or more key distributors for product sales, and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenues. Distributors may face financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results. Violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 or similar laws by distributors or other third-party intermediaries could have a material impact on our business. Failing to manage risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales, increase expenses, and weaken our competitive position.\nFinancial Risks\nOur debt could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our indebtedness.\nAs of October 31, 2016, we had $136.5 million of total debt outstanding (including capital lease obligations of $7.3 million).\nOur debt could have important consequences to you. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby limiting our ability to fund acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that may have less debt; and\n\u2022\nlimit, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future. We are party to the Second Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (the \u201ccredit facility\u201d), dated February 22, 2012, with Wells Fargo Bank National Association (\u201cWells Fargo\u201d), which was amended on August 20, 2014, January 29, 2016 and September 13, 2016. We also maintain a secured credit facility at our Canadian subsidiary, used to support operations, which is generally serviced by local cash flows from operations. As of October 31, 2016, we would have been permitted to borrow up to an additional $141.5 million under the credit facility (after taking into account $4.1 million of outstanding letters of credit) and $3.7 million under our credit line available to our Canadian subsidiary, in each case based on the respective available borrowing base; however, certain provisions of the Merger Agreement currently restrict us from incurring more than $65 million in the ordinary course thereunder without the consent of Berry. As of October 31, 2016, we had $1.3 million in borrowings under our credit facilities. In addition, the terms of the indenture that governs the senior notes do not prohibit us or our subsidiaries from issuing and incurring additional debt upon satisfaction of certain conditions. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks described above that we and our subsidiaries face could intensify.\nTo service our debt or redeem such debt upon a change of control, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.\nOur ability to service our debt and to fund our operations and planned capital expenditures will depend on our financial and operating performance. This, in part, is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control. If our cash flow from operations is insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, forgo acquisition opportunities, obtain additional equity capital or indebtedness, or refinance or restructure our debt. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial cash flow problems and might be required to sell material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We cannot assure you as to the timing of such sales or the proceeds that we could realize from such sales or if additional debt or equity financing would be available on acceptable terms, if at all.\nA provision of the senior notes requires us, upon a change of control, to offer to purchase the outstanding senior notes. If a change of control were to occur and we could not obtain a waiver or if we do not have the funds to make the purchase, we would be in default under the senior notes, which could, in turn, cause any of our debt that contains a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision to become immediately due and payable. If our debt were to be accelerated, we cannot assure you that we would be able to repay it.\nWe are subject to a number of restrictive debt covenants that may restrict our business and financing activities.\nOur credit facility and the indenture that governs the senior notes contain restrictive debt covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to:\n\u2022\nborrow money;\n\u2022\npay dividends and make distributions;\n\u2022\nissue stock of subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments;\n\u2022\nrepurchase stock;\n\u2022\nuse assets as security in other transactions;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nenter into affiliate transactions;\n\u2022\nmerge or consolidate; and\n\u2022\ntransfer and sell assets.\nOur agreement relating to the credit line available to our Canadian subsidiary also contains certain of these restrictive debt covenants. These covenants could adversely limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions, meet our capital needs and execute our business strategy.\nIn addition, our credit facility also requires us to meet certain financial tests, and our agreement relating to the credit line available to our Canadian subsidiary requires it to meet certain financial tests. These restrictive covenants may limit our ability to expand or to pursue our business strategies. Furthermore, any indebtedness that we incur in the future may contain similar or more restrictive covenants.\nOur ability to comply with the restrictions contained in our credit facility, the senior notes indenture and the credit line available to our Canadian subsidiary may be affected by changes in our business condition or results of operations, adverse regulatory developments or other events beyond our control. A failure to comply with these restrictions could result in a default under our credit facility, the senior notes indenture and the credit line available to our Canadian subsidiary, or any other subsequent financing agreement, which could, in turn, cause any of our debt that contains a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision to become immediately due and payable. If our debt were to be accelerated, we cannot assure you that we would be able to repay it. In addition, a default could give our lenders the right to terminate any commitments that they had made to provide us with additional funds. Further, the credit facility is secured by liens on most of our domestic assets (other than real property and equipment) and on 66% of our ownership interest in certain foreign subsidiaries and, in the event of a default thereunder, the lenders generally would be entitled to seize the collateral.\nRisks Related to an Investment in Our Common Stock\nOur common stock price has been and may continue to be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated regularly and significantly in the past. The market price of our common stock will continue to be subject to significant fluctuations in response to a variety of factors in addition to the pending Integrated Mergers (see above \u201cRisks Related to the Integrated Mergers-The pendency of the Integrated Mergers could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition\u201d), including:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in operating results, including as a result of changes in resin prices, LIFO reserve, and the other variables;\n\u2022\nour liquidity needs and constraints;\n\u2022\nthe business environment, including the operating results and stock prices of companies in the industries we serve;\n\u2022\nchanges in general conditions in the U.S. and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism and natural disasters or responses to such events;\n\u2022\nannouncements concerning our business or that of our competitors or customers;\n\u2022\nacquisitions and divestitures;\n\u2022\nthe introduction of new products or changes in product pricing policies by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nchange in earnings estimates or recommendations by research analysts who track our common stock or the stocks of other companies in our industry or failure of analysts to cover our common stock;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022\nsales of common stock by our employees, directors and executive officers;\n\u2022\nprevailing interest rates; and\n\u2022\nperceived dilution from stock issuances.\nSome companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have been subject to securities class action suits filed against them. If a suit were to be filed against us, regardless of the outcome, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nAlthough our common stock has had increased trading volume for periods of time in the last few years, our common stock generally has had a low trading volume historically, which could cause further volatility in the market price of our common stock.\nShares of common stock eligible for future sale, and additional equity offerings by us, may adversely affect our common stock price.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of substantial amounts of additional shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales could occur. This could also impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities at a time and price favorable to us. As of October 31, 2016, under our certificate of incorporation, as amended, we are authorized to issue 30 million shares of common stock, of which approximately 5.1 million shares of common stock were outstanding, approximately 49,000 shares of common stock were issuable upon the exercise of currently outstanding stock options and 0.2 million shares of common stock were issuable upon the settlement of performance units if the performance unit holders elect settlement in stock.\nWe may also decide to raise additional funds through public or private equity financing to fund our operations or for other business purposes. New issuances of equity securities would reduce your percentage ownership in us and the new equity securities could have rights and preferences with priority over those of our common stock. Additional equity issuances other than in connection with stock-based compensation in the ordinary course of business are not anticipated during the pendency of the Integrated Mergers.\nDelaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover, which could cause the market price of our shares to decline.\nWe are a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. For example, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder.\nIn addition, our restated certificate of incorporation and seventh amended and restated by-laws contain provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nrequiring supermajority approval of stockholders for certain business combinations or an amendment to, or repeal of, the by-laws;\n\u2022\nprohibiting stockholders from acting by written consent without Board approval;\n\u2022\nprohibiting stockholders from calling special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nestablishing a classified Board of Directors, which allows approximately one-third of our directors to be elected each year;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the removal of directors;\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for nominating candidates for election to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\npermitting the Board of Directors to amend or repeal the by-laws; and\n\u2022\npermitting the Board of Directors to designate one or more series of preferred stock.\nFurther, on March 28, 2014, our Board adopted an amended and restated stockholder rights plan, which amended and restated in its entirety the prior three-year stockholder rights plan that was to expire on March 31, 2014. The amended and restated stockholder rights plan is designed to assure that all of our stockholders receive fair and equal treatment in the event of any proposed takeover of the Company and to guard against partial tender offers, open market accumulations and other abusive or coercive tactics without paying stockholders a control premium. The amended and restated stockholder rights plan may have anti-takeover effects by discouraging potential proxy contests and other takeover methods, particularly those that have not been negotiated with the Board, and the amended and restated stockholder rights plan may also inhibit the acquisition of a controlling position in our common stock. Therefore, transactions may not occur that stockholders would otherwise support and/or from which they would receive a substantial premium for their shares over the current market price. The amended and restated stockholder rights plan may also make it more difficult to remove members of the current Board or management. In connection with the Merger Agreement and the Integrated Mergers, the Company entered into the Third Amendment, dated as of August 24, 2016, to the amended and restated rights agreement which, among other things, exempts the Merger Agreement (and the transactions contemplated thereby) from certain provisions of the amended and restated rights agreement and provides for the expiration of the amended and restated stockholder rights plan immediately prior to the effective time of the Integrated Mergers (but only if the effective time occurs).\nFurthermore, as discussed above, certain provisions of the Merger Agreement may prevent or discourage a takeover. See above \u201cRisks Related to the Integrated Mergers-While the Merger Agreement is in effect, we are subject to restrictions on our business activities and our pursuit of strategic alternatives\u201d.\nOur issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect holders of our common stock.\nWe are currently authorized to issue 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock in accordance with our restated certificate of incorporation, 30,000 of which is designated as Series A Preferred Stock in connection with the amended and restated stockholder rights plan and none of which is issued and outstanding. Our Board of Directors has the power, without stockholder approval, to set the terms of any such series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights, and preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends or if we liquidate, dissolve or wind up our business and other terms. If we issue preferred stock in the future that has preference over our common\nstock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock, the rights of holders of our common stock or the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected. Additional equity issuances other than in connection with stock-based compensation in the ordinary course of business are not anticipated during the pendency of the Integrated Mergers.", "PERMNO": 10025, "SIC": 3081, "TIC": "AEPI"}
