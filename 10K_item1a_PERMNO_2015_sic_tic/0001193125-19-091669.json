{"cik": "1437226", "company": "Mastech Digital, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-29", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider each of the following risk factors and all of the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or incorporated by reference herein. Based on the information currently known to us, we believe that the following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting our company. However, additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely impact our business.\nIf any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events, these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur industries are highly competitive and fragmented, which may limit our ability to increase our prices for services.\nThe IT staffing services and data analytics services industries are highly competitive and served by numerous global, national, regional and local firms. Primary competitors include participants from a variety of market segments, including the major consulting firms, systems consulting and implementation firms, U.S.-based staffing services companies, data and analytics service companies, applications software firms, service groups of computer equipment companies, specialized consulting firms, programming companies and temporary staffing firms. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources and greater name recognition than we have. There are relatively few barriers to entry into many of our markets, and as such we may face additional competition from new entrants into our markets. In addition, there is a risk that clients may elect to increase their internal resources to satisfy their staffing and data and analytics needs. There can be no assurance that we will compete successfully with existing or new competitors in the staffing and data analytics services markets.\nLack of success in recruitment and retention of IT and Data and Analytics professionals may decrease our revenues and increase the costs needed to maintain our workforce.\nOur business involves the delivery of professional services and is labor-intensive. Our success depends upon our ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled professionals who possess the skills and experience necessary to deliver our services. Qualified IT and data and analytics professionals are in demand worldwide and are likely to remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance that these qualified professionals will be available to us in sufficient numbers, or that we will be successful in retaining current or future employees. Failure to attract and retain qualified professionals in sufficient numbers may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Historically, we have done much of our recruiting from outside of the country where the client work is performed. Accordingly, any perception among our IT professionals, whether or not well founded, that our ability to assist them in obtaining temporary work visas and permanent residency status has been diminished, could lead to significant employee attrition. Any significant employee attrition will increase expenses necessary to replace and retrain our professionals and could decrease our revenues if we are not able to provide sufficient numbers of these resources to our clients.\nGovernment regulation of H-1B visas may materially affect our workforce and limit our supply of qualified IT professionals, or increase our cost of securing workers.\nWe recruit IT professionals on a global basis and, therefore, must comply with the immigration laws in the countries in which we operate, particularly the U.S. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 37% of our workforce was working under Mastech Digital sponsored H1-B temporary work permits. Statutory law limits the number of new H1-B petitions that may be approved in a fiscal year, and if we are unable to obtain H1-B visas for our employees in sufficient quantities or at a sufficient rate for a significant period of time, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. Additionally, legislation could be enacted limiting H1-B visa holders\u2019 employment with staffing and data analytics companies, which could result in reduced revenues and/or a higher cost of recruiting.\nIn recent years, the vast majority of our H1-B hires were not subject to the annual quota limiting H1-B visas because they were already in the U.S. under H1-B visa status with other employers. As a result, the negative impact on recruiting due to the exhaustion of recent H1-B quotas was not substantial. However, the subject of H1-B visas has recently become a major political discussion point and there are indications that the entire H1-B visa program may be significantly overhauled. If a new or revised H1-B visa program is implemented, there could be elements of the new/revised H1-B visa program that may not be advantageous to our business model thus adversely impacting our business, operating results or financial condition.\nRestrictions on immigration or increased enforcement of immigration laws could increase our cost of doing business, cause us to change the way we conduct our business or otherwise disrupt our operations.\nThe success of our business is dependent on our ability to recruit IT and data and analytics professionals and to mobilize them to meet our clients\u2019 needs. Immigration laws in the countries in which we operate are subject to legislative changes, as well as variations in the standards of application and enforcement due to political forces and economic conditions. It is difficult to predict the political and economic events that could affect immigration laws, or the restrictive impact they could have on obtaining or renewing work visas for our professionals.\nImmigration reform continues to attract significant attention in the public arena and in the current U.S. administration and Congress. If new immigration legislation is enacted in the U.S. or in the other jurisdictions in which we do business, such legislation may contain provisions that could make it more difficult or costly for us to recruit and retain IT professionals, and to a lesser extent data and analytics professionals. Additionally, there is uncertainty as to the position the U.S. will take with respect to immigration under the Trump administration. As a result, we may incur additional costs to run our business or may have to change the way we conduct our operations, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Also, we cannot be assured that the enforcement of immigration laws by governmental authorities will not disrupt our workforce.\nThe U.S. Congress and Trump administration may make substantial changes to fiscal, tax, and other federal policies that may adversely affect our business.\nIn 2017, U.S. Congress and the Trump administration made substantial changes to U.S. policies, which included comprehensive corporate and individual tax reform. In addition, the Trump administration has called for significant changes to U.S. trade, healthcare, immigration and government regulatory policy. Some of the called-for changes would require Congressional approval, while others have already been, and may in the future be carried out unilaterally by the executive branch of the U.S. government. To the extent the U.S. Congress or Trump administration implements changes to U.S. policy, those changes may impact, among other things, the U.S. and global economy, international trade relations, unemployment, immigration, healthcare, the U.S. regulatory environment, inflation and other areas. Although we cannot predict the impact, if any, of these changes to our business, they could adversely affect our business. Until we know what policy changes are made and how those changes impact our business and the business of our competitors over the long term, we will not know if, overall, we will benefit from them or be negatively affected by them.\nNegative economic conditions in North America may adversely affect demand for our services.\nApproximately 99% of our revenues are generated from clients located in North America. Our business depends on the overall demand for IT and data and analytics professionals and on the economic health of our clients. Weak economic conditions may force companies to reduce their staffing and data and analytics budgets and adversely affect demand for our services, thus reducing our revenues.\nWe may have difficulty maintaining client relationships if the trend towards utilizing Managed Service Providers continues.\nWithin our IT staffing segment, many large users of staffing services are employing MSP\u2019s to manage their contractor expenses in an effort to drive down overall costs. The impact of this shift towards the MSP model has been to lower our gross margins. Should this trend towards utilizing the MSP model continue, it is likely that our gross margins will be pressured in the future. In addition, if large users of staffing services continue to employ MSPs, the relationship between us and those large users may be primarily conducted through MSPs, in which case we may have difficulty maintaining those client relationships because the MSP model uses the MSP as an intermediary between the staffing service provider and the end-user, and reduces our direct contact with the end-user.\nWe are dependent upon our Indian operations and there can be no assurance that our Indian operations will support our growth strategy and historical cost structure.\nOur Indian recruitment and delivery centers depend greatly upon business and technology transfer laws in India, and upon the continued development of technology infrastructure. There can be no assurance that our Indian operations will support our growth strategy. The risks inherent in our Indian business activities include:\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in regulatory environments;\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations;\n\u2022\ntariffs and other trade barriers;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing international operations; and\n\u2022\nthe burden of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations.\nOur failure to manage growth, attract and retain personnel or a significant interruption in our ability to transmit data and voice efficiently, could have a material adverse impact on our ability to successfully maintain and develop our global recruitment and delivery centers and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe Indian rupee may increase in value relative to the dollar, increasing our costs. Although, we receive the vast majority of our revenues in U.S. dollars, we maintain a significant portion of our recruiting and delivery workforces in India, and those employees are paid in rupees. Therefore, any increase in the value of the rupee versus the dollar would increase our expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nRegional conflicts in South Asia could adversely affect the Indian economy, disrupt our operations and cause our business to suffer.\nSouth Asia has, from time to time, experienced instances of civil unrest and hostilities among neighboring countries, such as between India and Pakistan and even within India. There have been military confrontations along the India-Pakistan border from time to time. The potential for hostilities between the two countries is high due to past terrorist incidents in India, troop mobilizations along the border, and the geopolitical situation in the region. Military activity or terrorist attacks in the future could influence the Indian economy by disrupting communications and making travel more difficult. This, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWage costs in India may increase, which may reduce our operating margins and reduce a competitive advantage of ours.\nOur wage costs in India have historically been significantly lower than wage costs in the U.S. for comparably skilled professionals, and this has been one of our competitive advantages with respect to the costs of our Indian recruiting and delivery offices. However, wage increases in India may prevent us from sustaining this competitive advantage and may negatively affect our operating margins. We may need to increase the levels of our employee compensation more rapidly than in the past to retain talent. Unless we are able to continue to increase the efficiency and productivity of our employees, wage increases in the long term may reduce our overall margins.\nOur quarterly operating results may be subject to significant variations.\nOur revenues and operating results have historically been subject to significant variations from quarter to quarter depending on a number of factors, including the timing and number of client projects commenced and completed during the quarter, the number of working days in a quarter, employee hiring and attrition, and utilization rates during the quarter.\nOur acquisition of Hudson IT may not provide us with the long-term business advantages that we expected which may result in the slower growth of our business and reduced operating margins.\nOur June 15, 2015 acquisition of Hudson IT and the purchase price of such was based on a series of long-term assumptions and estimates. There can be no assurance that these long-term expectations will be completely realized and could result in a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur acquisition of InfoTrellis, Inc. may not provide us with the long-term business advantages that we expected which may result in the slower growth of our business and reduced operating margins.\nOur July 13, 2017 acquisition of the service division of InfoTrellis, Inc. and the purchase price of such was based on a series of long-term assumptions and estimates. There can be no assurance that these long-term expectations will be completely realized and could result in a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur strategy of expansion through the acquisition of additional companies may not be successful and may result in slower growth of our business and reduced operating margins.\nWe plan to gradually expand our operations through the acquisition of, or investment in, additional businesses and companies. We may be unable to identify businesses that complement our strategy for growth. If we do succeed in identifying a company with such a business, we may not be able to acquire the company, its relevant business or an interest in the company for many reasons, including:\n\u2022\na failure to agree on the terms of the acquisition or investment;\n\u2022\nincompatibility between us and the management of the company that we wish to acquire or invest;\n\u2022\ncompetition from other potential acquirers;\n\u2022\na lack of capital to make the acquisition or investment; or\n\u2022\nthe unwillingness of the company to partner with us.\nIf we are unable to acquire and invest in attractive businesses, our strategy for growth may be impaired. Even if we are able to complete one or more acquisitions, there can be no assurance that those completed acquisitions will result in successful growth, and the costs of completing an acquisition may reduce our margins.\nWe have made in the past, and may make in the future, acquisitions which could require significant management attention, disrupt our business, result in dilution to our shareholders, deplete our cash reserves, increase our debt levels and adversely affect our financial results.\nAcquisitions, such as our recent acquisitions of Hudson IT and the services division of InfoTrellis, Inc., involve numerous risks, including the possibility that:\n\u2022\nwe do not successfully integrate the operations, systems, technologies, products, offerings and personnel of the acquired company or companies;\n\u2022\nwe do not generate sufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with our acquisitions;\n\u2022\nour management\u2019s attention is diverted from normal daily operations of our business and the challenges with managing larger and more widespread operations resulting from our acquisitions;\n\u2022\nwe experience difficulties entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions; and\n\u2022\nwe lose key employees, customers, distributors, vendors and other business partners of the companies we acquire following and continuing after announcement of acquisition plans.\nIn addition to the foregoing, acquisitions may also cause us to:\n\u2022\nuse a substantial portion of our cash reserves or incur debt;\n\u2022\nissue equity securities or grant equity incentives that dilute our current shareholders\u2019 percentage ownership;\n\u2022\nassume liabilities, including potentially unknown liabilities;\n\u2022\nrecord goodwill and amortizable intangible assets that are subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges;\n\u2022\nincur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets;\n\u2022\nincur large and immediate write-offs and restructuring and other related expenses; and\n\u2022\nbecome subject to intellectual property litigation or other litigation.\nAcquisitions of technology companies and assets are inherently risky and subject to many factors outside of our control and no assurance can be given that our recently completed or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. Failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could materially harm our business and operating results.\nChanges in the inputs used to calculate our acquisition-related contingent consideration liability could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\nIn connection with the InfoTrellis acquisition, we may be required to pay future consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of specified EBIT objectives (\u201cearnings before interest and taxes\u201d). As of the acquisition date, we recorded a contingent consideration liability representing the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration that is expected to be paid. In 2018, the Company revalued the contingent consideration liability after determining that relevant conditions for payment of such liability were unlikely to be fully satisfied. The revaluation resulted in an $11.1 million reduction to the contingent consideration liability. This estimated fair value is based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable but which are uncertain and involve significant judgments by management. Changes in business conditions or other events could materially change the inputs used in this fair value calculation, which could cause us to record a change in the contingent consideration liability. Any such adjustment could have a material effect on our results of operations.\nOur revenues are highly concentrated and the loss of a significant client would adversely affect our business and revenues.\nOur revenues are highly dependent on clients located in North America., as well as clients concentrated in certain industries. Economic slowdowns, changes in law and other restrictions or factors that affect the economic health of these industries may affect our business. For the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 47% of our revenues were derived from our top ten clients. Consequently, if our clients reduce or postpone their spending significantly, this may lower the demand for our services and negatively affect our revenues and profitability. Further, any significant decrease in the rate of economic growth may reduce the demand for our services and negatively affect our revenues and profitability.\nWe have in the past, and may in the future, derive a significant portion of our revenues from a relatively limited number of clients. These contracts are terminable without penalty, as are most of our contracts. The loss of any significant client or major project, or an unanticipated termination of a major project, could result in the loss of substantial anticipated revenues.\nOur leverage could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or operating flexibility and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our Credit Agreement.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had outstanding borrowings of $39.1 million under our Credit Agreement with PNC Bank and certain other financial institution lenders (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d), which amount consists of\n$25.5 million of outstanding borrowings under the term loan thereunder and $13.6 million of outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility thereunder. Our level of indebtedness could have important consequences on our future operations, including the following:\n\u2022\nincreasing the risk that we cannot satisfy our payment or other obligations under our outstanding debt, which may result in defaults;\n\u2022\nsubjecting us to increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on our outstanding indebtedness, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly;\n\u2022\nreducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and general economic conditions;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged; and\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions.\nIn addition, we may incur additional indebtedness in the future and, if we incur new debt or other liabilities, the related risks that we face could intensify.\nOur ability to make required payments or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business and economic conditions and other factors, many of which are not in our control. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt agreements and other factors may restrict us from pursuing any of these alternatives.\nIf we are in default under our Credit Agreement due to our inability to make the required payments, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the financial and other covenants contained therein, all of our debt thereunder could be accelerated and the lenders under our Credit Agreement could be permitted to foreclose on our assets securing such debt.\nThe covenants in our Credit Agreement impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility.\nThe Credit Agreement contains financial covenants, including but not limited to, covenants related to the Company\u2019s senior leverage ratio and fixed charge ratio (as defined under the Credit Agreement), and limitations on liens, indebtedness, guarantees and contingent liabilities, loans and investments, distributions, leases, asset sales, stock repurchases and mergers and acquisitions. These covenants and limitations may limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\ncreate, incur or assume liens;\n\u2022\nmake investments and loans;\n\u2022\ncreate, incur, assume or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nengage in mergers, acquisitions, consolidations, sale-leasebacks and other similar transactions;\n\u2022\npay dividends, or redeem or repurchase our capital stock;\n\u2022\nalter the business that we conduct;\n\u2022\nengage in certain transactions with officers, directors and affiliates;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem or purchase other indebtedness;\n\u2022\nenter into certain agreements; and\n\u2022\nmake material changes to accounting and reporting practices.\nOperating results below current levels or other adverse factors, including increases in interest rates, could result in us being unable to comply with certain covenants contained in our Credit Agreement. If we violate these covenants and are unable to obtain waivers, our debt under the Credit Agreement would be in default, could be accelerated and could permit our lenders to foreclose on our assets securing the debt thereunder. If the indebtedness is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us. If our debt is in default for any reason, our cash flows, operating results, or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, complying with these covenants may also cause us to take actions that may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions.\nWe must keep pace with the rapid technological changes that characterize the IT and data and analytics industries and our failure could result in lower demand for services.\nThe IT staffing and data analytics services industries are characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, changing client preferences and new product introductions. Our success will depend in part on our ability to keep pace with industry developments. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in addressing these developments on a timely basis or that, if these developments are addressed, we will be successful in the marketplace. In addition, there can be no assurance that products or technologies developed by others will not render our services noncompetitive or obsolete. Our failure to address these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nA significant number of organizations are attempting to migrate their IT business applications to advanced technologies. As a result, our ability to remain competitive depends on several factors, including our ability to develop, train and hire employees with skills in advanced technologies. Our failure to hire, train and retain employees with such skills could have a material adverse impact on our future revenues.\nOur \u201cpreferred vendor\u201d contracts generally result in lower margins. In addition, we may not be able to maintain \u201cpreferred vendor\u201d status with existing clients or obtain that status with new clients, which may lead to a decrease in the volume of business we obtain from these clients.\nIn our IT staffing segments, we are party to several \u201cpreferred vendor\u201d contracts, and we are seeking additional similar contracts in order to obtain new or additional business from large and medium-sized clients. Clients enter into these contracts to reduce their number of vendors and obtain better pricing in return for a potential increase in the volume of business to the preferred vendor. While these contracts are expected to generate higher volumes, they generally carry lower margins. Although we attempt to lower costs to maintain margins, there can be no assurance that we will be able to sustain margins on such contracts. In addition, the failure to be designated as a preferred vendor, or the loss of such status, may preclude us from providing services to existing or potential clients, except as a subcontractor, which could have a material adverse effect on the volume of business obtained from such clients.\nOur success depends upon the maintenance and protection of our intellectual property rights and processes, and any substantial costs incurred protecting such rights and processes may decrease our operating margins.\nOur success depends in part upon certain methodologies and tools we use in designing, developing and implementing application systems and other proprietary intellectual property rights. We rely upon a combination\nof nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and trade secrets, copyright and trademark laws to protect our proprietary rights and the proprietary rights of third parties from whom we license intellectual property. We enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and limit distribution of proprietary information. There can be no assurance that the steps we take in this regard will be adequate to deter misappropriation of proprietary information or that we will be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights. In the event of an unfavorable resolution of a dispute over our intellectual property rights, we may incur substantial costs or liabilities, which would decrease our operating margins.\nOur ownership is highly concentrated in two individuals and the interests of those individual shareholders may not coincide with yours.\nSunil Wadhwani and Ashok Trivedi, co-founders of the Company, own approximate 62% of Mastech Digital\u2019s outstanding common stock. Accordingly, Messrs. Wadhwani and Trivedi together have sufficient voting power to elect all the members of the Board of Directors and to effect transactions without the approval of our other shareholders, except for those limited transactions that require a supermajority vote under our bylaws or articles of incorporation. The interests of Messrs. Wadhwani and Trivedi may from time to time diverge from our interests. Mastech Digital\u2019s Audit Committee consists of independent directors and addresses certain potential conflicts of interest and related party transactions that may arise between us and our directors, officers or our other affiliates. However, there can be no assurance that any conflicts of interest will be resolved in our favor.\nOur business is certified as a minority-owned business, and loss of that certification may impact our ability to gain new customers or expand our business with existing customers.\nWe are a large minority-owned staffing and data analytics services firm and have been certified as minority-owned by the National Minority Supplier Development Council (the \u201cNMSDC\u201d). NMSDC certification has helped us to expand our business with existing clients as well as obtain new customers. While we cannot quantify the effect of the loss of this status, its loss could adversely affect our ability to expand our business or cause us to lose existing business.\nBecause the NMSDC certification relies in large part upon Messrs. Wadhwani and Trivedi maintaining their positions as the collective majority holders of our common stock, any decrease in their collective ownership may jeopardize our status as a minority-owned business. There can be no assurance that Messrs. Wadhwani and Trivedi will maintain their majority position in the Company.\nExisting and potential customers may consider outsourcing their IT requirements to foreign countries, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain new customers or retain existing customers.\nIn the past few years, more companies started to use low-cost offshore outsourcing centers to perform technology-related work. Should this shift towards moving technology-related work to offshore outsourcing centers continue, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely effected.\nWe may be subject to liability to clients arising from our engagements.\nMany of our engagements involve projects that are critical to the operations of our clients\u2019 businesses and provide benefits that may be difficult to quantify. Although we attempt to contractually limit our liability for damages arising from errors, mistakes, omissions or negligent acts in rendering our services, there can be no assurance that our attempts to limit liability will be successful. Our failure or inability to meet a client\u2019s expectations in the performance of our services could result in a material adverse change to the client\u2019s operations and, therefore, could give rise to claims against us or damage our reputation, adversely affecting our business, operating results and financial condition.\nRequirements of the Affordable Care Act may continue to increase our employee benefits costs and could negatively affect our operating results, cash flows and financial condition if such costs aren\u2019t recovered with increases in client bill rates.\nWe provide healthcare coverage to our U.S.-based employees that are subject to the Affordable Care Act (\u201cACA\u201d). Additional provisions of the ACA and the compliance of such may result in higher overall costs to the Company, which could have a negative impact on our operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in our data center and on our networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers, and damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our services, which could adversely affect our operating results and competitive position. We maintain cyber risk insurance, but this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses from any breaches of our networks.\nIf our clients are subjected to cyber-attacks or data security breaches, it may result in damage to our business and the disclosure of our confidential information.\nIn addition to cybersecurity threats posed directly against us, our clients\u2019 information systems are also vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks. There is no guarantee that our clients have implemented procedures that are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches. The failure of our clients to adequately safeguard against data security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. The theft and/or breach of our clients\u2019 data security could cause the disclosure and/or loss of our confidential information and data and result in significant costs. In addition, any cybersecurity damage to the networks or computer systems used by us or our clients could result in a claim for substantial damages against us and significant reputational harm, regardless of our responsibility for the failure.\nRisks posed by climate change may materially increase our compliance costs and adversely impact our profitability.\nClimate change vulnerability is posing new threats and opportunities in the global economy. Climate change and measures adopted to address it can affect us, our clients and suppliers in myriad ways, depending on the nature and location of the businesses, the near-term capital expenditure needs, the regulatory environments where they operate and their strategic plans. Generally, climate risks and opportunities for companies and their investors fall into four categories:\n\u2022\nPhysical risk from climate change;\n\u2022\nRegulatory risks and opportunities related to existing or proposed greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emissions limits;\n\u2022\nIndirect regulatory risks and opportunities related to products or services from high emitting companies; and\n\u2022\nLitigation risks for emitters of greenhouse gases.\nUnmitigated climate change is likely to have severe physical impacts on companies with exposed assets or business operations, including Mastech Digital. Major environmental risks and liabilities can significantly impact future earnings. To the extent we are unable to comply with applicable regulations related to climate change, and such failure to comply results in material increases in compliance costs or litigation expenses, those costs or expenses will have an adverse effect on our profitability.\nIf our clients are adversely affected by climate change or related compliance costs, this may reduce their spending and demand for our services, leading to a decrease in revenue.\nIn addition to emissions and climate change risks posed directly to Mastech Digital, we also have clients in varied industries such as healthcare, consumer products, manufacturing, technology, and retail, among others. Some of the clients may be significantly affected by the climate change resulting in greater physical risk. This may lead to a reduction of demand and loss of business from such clients, which would impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf our insurance costs increase significantly, these incremental costs could negatively affect our financial results.\nWe purchase various insurance policies to limit or transfer certain risks inherent in our operations. These costs largely relate to obtaining and maintaining professional and general liability insurance policies. If the costs of carrying these insurance policies increase significantly, due to poor claims history or changes in market conditions, this could have an adverse impact on our profitability and financial condition.\nAny disruption in the supply of power, IT infrastructure and telecommunications lines to our facilities could disrupt our business process or subject us to additional costs.\nAny disruption in basic infrastructure, including the supply of power, could negatively impact our ability to provide timely or adequate services to our clients. We rely on a number of telecommunication services and other infrastructure providers to maintain communications between our various facilities and clients. Telecommunications networks are subject to failures and periods of service disruption which can adversely affect our ability to maintain active voice and data communications among our facilities and with our clients. This could disrupt our business process or subject us to additional costs, materially adversely affecting our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe broad provisions of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 may negatively impact our ability to receive tax deductions for certain expenses that we incur, which could adversely impact our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \u201cTax Cut and Jobs Act\u201d) enacted on December 22, 2017, makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code including, but not limited to, the following, which may impact us: 1) reductions in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent; 2) new limitations on deductible interest expense; 3) limitations of the deductibility of certain executive compensation; and 4) limits on certain other types of deductions. While we continue to evaluate the effects of this legislation, we have recorded an aggregate $623,000 tax expense in 2017 and 2018 related to the estimated re-measurement of our deferred tax asset balance and an estimated one-time transition tax applicable to the new dividend exemption rules related to foreign earnings. While the Tax Cut and Jobs Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate applicable to us in 2018, it is possible that other provisions of this Act and the absence of guidance on various ambiguities in the application of certain provisions thereunder could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 92797, "SIC": 7361, "TIC": "MHH"}
