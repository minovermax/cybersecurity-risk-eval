{"cik": "702513", "company": "Bank of Commerce Holdings", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-10", "item_1A": "Item 1a - Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to various economic risks that could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe conduct banking operations principally in Northern California. As a result, our business results are dependent in large part upon the business activity, population, income levels, deposits and real estate activity in Northern California. While both the national economy and local economies in which the Bank operates have improved, there is no assurance the improvement will continue. Additionally, a sluggish recovery in real estate values and an elevated level of unemployment in the primary markets we serve could have an adverse effect on our borrowers or their customers, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the State of California continues to experience significant budgetary and fiscal difficulties. The businesses operating in California and Sacramento in particular depend on these state employees for business, and reduced spending activity by these state employees could have a material impact on the success or failure of these businesses, some of which are current or potential future customers of the Bank. A future deterioration in economic conditions, particularly within our geographic region, could result in the following consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations:\n\u25cf\nLoan delinquencies may increase causing increases in our provision for loan and lease loss and ALLL;\n\u25cf\nFinancial sector regulators may adopt more restrictive practices or interpretations of existing regulations, or adopt new regulations;\n\u25cf\nCollateral for loans made by the Bank, especially real estate related, may decline in value, which in turn could reduce a client\u2019s borrowing power, and reduce the value of assets and collateral associated with our loans held for investment;\n\u25cf\nConsumer confidence levels may decline and cause adverse changes in payment patterns, resulting in increased delinquencies and default rates on loans and other credit facilities and decreased demand for our products and services; and\n\u25cf\nPerformance of the underlying loans in the private label mortgage backed securities we hold may deteriorate, potentially causing other-than-temporary impairment markdowns to our investment portfolio.\nNonperforming assets take significant time to resolve and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe generally do not record interest income on nonperforming loans or other real estate owned, thereby adversely affecting our income, and increasing our loan administration costs. When we take collateral in foreclosures and similar proceedings, we are required to mark the related asset to the then fair market value of the collateral, which may ultimately result in a loss. An increase in the level of nonperforming assets increases our risk profile and consequently may impact the capital levels our regulators believe are appropriate.\nWhile we reduce problem assets through loan sales, workouts, restructurings and otherwise, decreases in the value of the underlying collateral, or in these borrowers\u2019 performance or financial condition, whether or not due to economic and market conditions beyond our control, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the resolution of nonperforming assets requires significant commitments of time from management and our directors, which can be detrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities. As economic conditions continue to improve, we expect a relatively lower level of non-performing assets and losses relating to such assets, however there can be no assurance that we will not experience future increases in nonperforming assets.\nThe loan portfolio includes a significant amount of purchased loans and a significant amount of loans serviced by another company.\nPurchased loans included in the loan portfolio totaled $128 million or 19% of gross portfolio loans as of December 31, 2014. The loans were purchased as a pool of loans, whole loans or purchased participations from another institution and some of the loans are outside the Company\u2019s primary market. The loans were purchased under several different contracts however $79 million or 12% of gross portfolio loans are serviced by two separate servicing companies. Additionally, the Company has agreed to purchase an additional $14 million in loans from one of the servicing companies. A disruption to the operations of the loan servicing companies could reduce the value of the assets that we hold as collateral. In addition, if we are forced to foreclose and service these loans ourselves, we may realize additional monitoring and servicing costs due to the geographic disbursement of the portfolio, both in and outside our market area which will adversely affect our noninterest expense.\nWe have a concentration risk in real estate related loans.\nA substantial portion of the Bank\u2019s lending is tied to real estate. As of December 31, 2014, approximately 72% of our loan portfolio was secured by real estate, the majority of which is commercial real estate. Of that amount, 5% of the portfolio consisted of construction loans, 50% in commercial real estate, 10% related to residential mortgage loans (including our Individual Tax Identification Number (\u201cITIN\u201d) portfolio) and 7% consisted of 1-4 family home equity lines of credit.\nA large percentage of our loan portfolio is secured by commercial real estate loans which generally carry larger loan balances and historically have involved a greater degree of financial and credit risks than residential first mortgage loans. These loans are primarily made based on and repaid from the cash flow of the borrower which may be unpredictable and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. Any decline in the economy in general, material increases in interest rates, changes in tax policies, tightening credit or refinancing markets, or a decline in real estate values in the Company\u2019s primary market areas in particular, as we witnessed with the deterioration in the residential development market since 2007, could have an adverse impact on the repayment of these loans. Any increases in net charge offs and in the ALLL, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nFuture loan and lease losses may exceed the allowance for loan and lease losses.\nWe have established a reserve for possible losses expected in connection with loans in the credit portfolio. This allowance reflects estimates of the collectability of certain identified loans, as well as an overall risk assessment of total loans outstanding.\nThe determination of the amount of allowance for loan and lease losses is subjective; although the method for determining the amount of the allowance uses criteria such as risk ratings and historical loss rates, these factors may not be adequate predictors of future loan performance, particularly in the current economic climate. Accordingly, we cannot offer assurances that these estimates ultimately will prove correct or that the loan and lease loss allowance will be sufficient to protect against losses that ultimately may occur. If the allowance for loan and lease losses proves to be inadequate, we will need to make additional provisions to the allowance, which is accounted for as charges to income, which would adversely impact results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, bank regulators frequently monitor banks\u2019 allowance for loan and lease losses, and if regulators were to determine that the allowance was inadequate, they may require us to increase the allowance, which also would adversely impact results of operations and financial condition.\nDefaults may negatively impact us.\nRisk arises from the possibility that losses will be sustained if a significant number of borrowers, guarantors and related parties fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loans. We have adopted underwriting and credit monitoring procedures and credit policies, including the establishment and review of the allowance for loan and lease losses, which management believes are appropriate to minimize risk by assessing the likelihood of nonperformance, tracking loan performance and diversifying the loan portfolio. These policies and procedures, however, may not prevent unexpected losses that could materially affect our results of operations.\nInterest rate fluctuations, which are out of our control, could harm profitability.\nOur income is highly dependent on \u201cinterest rate spreads\u201d (i.e., the difference between the interest income earned on the Bank\u2019s interest earning assets such as loans and securities, and the interest expense paid on the Bank\u2019s interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings). The underlying interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, which are beyond our control, including general economic conditions, inflation, recession and the policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, in particular, the Federal Reserve Board. Over the past two years, the company has repositioned the balance sheet into a neutral interest rate risk position as we plan for rising interest rates. By extending the duration of a portion of our liabilities and actively managing the investment portfolio to shorten the duration, we have effectively moved the bank from a liability sensitive position in a rising rate environment to a neutral or slightly asset sensitive position.\nAs a result, in a static environment we would generally be adversely affected by changes in interest rates. In addition, changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, influence the origination of loans, the purchase of investments and the generation of deposits. These changes also affect the rates received on loans and securities and paid on deposits, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in the fair value of our securities may reduce our shareholders\u2019 equity and net income.\nWe increase or decrease shareholders\u2019 equity by the amount of change from the unrealized gain or loss (the difference between the estimated fair value and the amortized cost) of our available-for-sale securities portfolio, net of the related tax, under the category of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Therefore, a decline in the estimated fair value of this portfolio will result in a decline in reported shareholders\u2019 equity, as well as book value per common share. This decrease will occur even though the securities are not sold. In the case of debt securities, if these securities are never sold and there are no credit impairments, the decrease will be recovered over the life of the securities. In the event there are credit loss related impairments, the credit loss component is recognized in earnings.\nWe own shares of FHLB stock which are recorded in other assets. The stock is carried at cost and is subject to recoverability testing under applicable accounting standards. As of December 31, 2014, we did not recognize an impairment charge related to our FHLB stock holdings; however, potential negative changes to the financial condition of the FHLB may require us to recognize an impairment charge with respect to such stock holdings. Any such impairment charge would have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nConditions in the financial markets may limit our access to additional funding to meet our liquidity needs.\nLiquidity is essential to our business, as we must maintain sufficient funds to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers. An inability to raise funds through deposits, repurchase agreements, federal funds purchased, FHLB advances, the sale or pledging as collateral of securities, loans, and other assets could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general. Factors that could negatively affect our access to liquidity sources include negative operating results, a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market downturn or negative regulatory action against us. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as severe disruption of the financial markets or negative news and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole. An inability to borrow funds to meet our liquidity needs could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe condition of other financial institutions could negatively affect us.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, public perceptions and other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks and other institutional clients.\nIn the event there are credit loss related impairments, the credit loss component is recognized in earnings. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to us. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThere can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue paying dividends on the common stock at recent levels.\nThe Company may not be able to continue paying quarterly dividends commensurate with recent levels given that the ability to pay dividends on the Company\u2019s common stock depends on a variety of factors. The payment of quarterly dividends is subject to government regulation in that regulatory authorities may prohibit banks and bank holding companies from paying dividends that would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice. The Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends is subject to certain regulatory requirements. The Federal Reserve Board generally prohibits a bank holding company from declaring or paying a cash dividend which would impose undue pressure on the capital of subsidiary banks or would be funded only through borrowing or other arrangements that might adversely affect a financial services holding company\u2019s financial position. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System policy is that a bank holding company should not continue its existing rate of cash dividends on its common stock unless its net income is sufficient to fully fund each dividend and its prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with its capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The power of the board of directors of an insured depository institution to declare a cash dividend or other distribution with respect to capital is subject to statutory and regulatory restrictions which limit the amount available for such distribution depending upon the earnings, financial condition and cash needs of the institution, as well as general business conditions.\nIn addition to the restrictions imposed under federal law, banks chartered under California law generally may only pay cash dividends to the extent such payments do not exceed the lesser of retained earnings of the bank or the bank\u2019s net income for its last three fiscal years (less any distributions to shareholders during such period). In the event a bank desires to pay cash dividends in excess of such amount, the bank may pay a cash dividend with the prior approval of the Commissioner of the CDBO in an amount not exceeding the greatest of the bank\u2019s retained earnings, the bank\u2019s net income for its last fiscal year, or the bank\u2019s net income for its current fiscal year. As of January 31, 2015, the Bank will be required to obtain regulatory approval from the CDBO for a dividend or other distribution to the Company. While based on informal discussions with the CDBO the Company expects to receive such approval, there can be no assurance that such approval will be obtained and that the Company will have the ability to continue to pay quarterly dividends.\nOur Series B Preferred Stock diminishes the net income available to our common shareholders and earnings per common share.\nOn September 28, 2011, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with the Secretary of the Treasury, pursuant to which the Company issued and sold to the Treasury 20,000 shares of its Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B, having a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share, for aggregate proceeds net of issuance costs of $19.9 million. The issuance was pursuant to the Treasury\u2019s SBLF program, a $30 billion fund established under the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, which encourages lending to small businesses by providing capital to qualified community banks with assets of less than $10 billion.\nThe Series B Preferred Stock is entitled to receive non-cumulative dividends payable quarterly on each January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1. The dividend rate, was calculated on the aggregate Liquidation Amount, and was initially set at 5% per annum based upon the initial level of Qualified Small Business Lending (\u201cQSBL\u201d) by the Bank. The dividend rate for future dividend periods was set based upon the percentage change in qualified lending between each dividend period and the baseline QSBL level established at the commencement of the Agreement. As a result of increased qualified lending, preferred stock dividends for the SBLF program are fixed at the current rate of 1% through January 2016. If the Series B Preferred Stock remains outstanding beyond January 2016, the dividend rate will be fixed at 9%. This increase in the Series B Preferred Stock annual dividend rate could have a material adverse effect on our earnings available to common shareholders and could also adversely affect our ability to pay dividends on our common shares. Management is currently evaluating options for potential repayment of the stock.\nWe rely heavily on our management team and the loss of key officers may adversely affect operations.\nThe Company is dependent on the successful recruitment and retention of highly qualified personnel. Our ability to implement our business strategies is closely tied to the strengths of our chief executive officer and other key officers. In 2013 and 2014 the Company made changes to reposition our senior management team adding two individuals and promoting two others. Our key officers have extensive experience in the banking industry but have only worked in their current roles at the Company for a short period of time. If we are unable to successfully integrate our new senior management members into the Company it could have an adverse impact on our business. Additionally, business banking, one of the Company\u2019s principal lines of business, is dependent on relationship banking, in which Company personnel develop professional relationships with small business owners and officers of larger business customers who are responsible for the financial management of the companies they represent. If management team members or other key employees were to leave the Company and become employed by a competing bank, the Company could potentially lose business customers. In addition, the Company relies on its customer service staff to effectively serve the needs of its customers. The loss of key employees to competitors or otherwise could have an adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition.\nInternal control systems could fail to detect certain events.\nWe are subject to many operating risks, including, without limitation, data processing system failures and errors, and customer or employee fraud. There can be no assurance that such an event will not occur, and if such an event is not prevented or detected by our other internal controls and does occur, and it is uninsured or is in excess of applicable insurance limits, it could have a significant adverse impact on our reputation in the business community and our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur operations could be interrupted if third party service providers experience difficulty, terminate their services or fail to comply with banking regulations.\nWe depend, and will continue to depend to a significant extent, on a number of relationships with third party service providers. Specifically, we utilize software and hardware systems for processing, essential web hosting, debit and credit card processing, merchant processing, Internet banking systems and other processing services from third party service providers. If these third party service providers experience difficulties or terminate their services, and we are unable to replace them with other qualified service providers, our operations could be interrupted. If an interruption were to continue for a significant period of time, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nConfidential customer information transmitted through the Bank\u2019s online banking service is vulnerable to security breaches and computer viruses, which could expose the Bank to litigation and adversely affect its reputation and ability to generate deposits.\nWe provide our customers the ability to bank online. We rely heavily on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information on our computer systems and networks. The secure transmission of confidential information over the Internet is a critical element of online banking. The Bank\u2019s network could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer hacking, cyber-attacks, electronic fraudulent activity, attempted theft of financial assets, computer viruses, phishing schemes and other security problems. We cannot guarantee that any such failures, interruption or security breaches will not occur, or if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. While we have certain protective policies and procedures in place, the nature and sophistication of the threats continue to evolve. The Bank may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses, alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses or to modify and enhance the Bank\u2019s protective measures. To the extent that the Bank\u2019s activities or the activities of our customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches and viruses could expose us and the Bank to claims, litigation and other possible liabilities. Any inability to prevent cyber-attacks, security breaches or computer viruses could also cause existing customers to lose confidence in the Bank\u2019s systems and could adversely affect our reputation and our ability to generate deposits.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation which could adversely affect our business.\nOur operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local governmental authorities and are subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing requirements and restrictions on part or all of our operations. Because our business is highly regulated, the laws, rules and regulations applicable to us are subject to modification and change. There are currently proposed laws, rules and regulations that, if adopted, would impact our operations.\nIn that regard, sweeping financial regulatory reform legislation the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act and Consumer Protection Act (\u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) was enacted in July 2010. Among other provisions, the legislation (i) created a new Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection with broad powers to regulate consumer financial products such as credit cards and mortgages, (ii) created a Financial Stability Oversight Council comprised of the heads of other regulatory agencies, (iii) will lead to new capital requirements from federal banking agencies, (iv) places new limits on electronic debit card interchange fees, and (v) requires the SEC and national stock exchanges to adopt significant new corporate governance and executive compensation reforms.\nThe third installment of the Basel Accords (the \u201cBasel III\u201d) for certain U.S. financial institutions is expected to be phased in between 2013 and 2019. Basel III sets forth more robust global regulatory standards on capital adequacy, qualifying capital instruments, leverage ratios, market liquidity risk, and stress testing, which may be stricter than standards currently in place. The implementation of these new standards could have an adverse impact on our financial position and future earnings due to, among other things, the increased minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirements that will be implemented.\nThese proposed laws, rules and regulations, or any other laws, rules or regulations, may be adopted in the future, which could (1) make compliance much more difficult or expensive, (2) restrict our ability to originate, broker or sell loans or accept certain deposits, (3) further limit or restrict the amount of commissions, interest or other charges earned on loans originated or sold by us, or (4) otherwise adversely affect our business or prospects for business. Moreover, banking regulators have significant discretion and authority to address what regulators perceive to be unsafe or unsound practices or violations of laws or regulations by financial institutions and holding companies in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties. The exercise of regulatory authority by banking regulators over us may have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, in order to conduct certain activities, including acquisitions, we are required to obtain regulatory approval. There can be no assurance that any required approvals can be obtained, or obtained without conditions or on a timeframe acceptable to us.\nIn addition, this increased regulation of the financial services industry restricts the ability of firms within the industry to conduct business consistent with historical practices, including aspects such as compensation, interest rates, new and inconsistent consumer protection regulations and mortgage regulation, among others. Congress or state legislatures could also adopt laws reducing the amount that borrowers are otherwise contractually required to pay under existing loan contracts, require lenders to extend or restructure certain loans or limit foreclosure and collection remedies. Federal and state regulatory agencies also frequently adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied.\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d) has implemented a plan to increase insurance premiums and imposed special assessments to rebuild and maintain the federal deposit insurance fund, and any additional future premium increases or special assessments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOn February 7, 2011, the FDIC Board of Directors issued final rules, effective April 1, 2011, implementing changes to the assessment rules resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act. The adopted regulations: (1) modify the definition of an institution\u2019s deposit insurance assessment base; (2) alter certain adjustments to the assessment rates; (3) revise the assessment rate schedules in light of the new assessment base and altered adjustments; and (4) provide for the automatic adjustment of the assessment rates in the future when the reserve ratio reaches certain milestones.\nWe expect volatility in the amount of deposit assessments and corresponding FDIC premiums in the future. As the large number of bank failures depleted the Deposit Insurance Fund in recent years, the FDIC continues to revise risk-based deposit insurance assessments as necessary. The Dodd-Frank Act broadened the base for FDIC insurance assessments and assessments are now based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act established 1.35% as the minimum deposit insurance fund reserve ratio. The FDIC has determined that the fund reserve ratio should be 2.0% and has adopted a plan under which it will meet the statutory minimum fund reserve ratio of 1.35% by the statutory deadline of September 30, 2020. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC to offset the effect on institutions with assets less than $10 billion of the increase in the statutory minimum fund reserve ratio to 1.35% from the former statutory minimum of 1.15%. As a result, the deposit insurance assessments to be paid by the Company could increase as a result.Despite the FDIC\u2019s actions to restore the deposit insurance fund, the fund will suffer additional losses in the future due to failures of insured institutions. There may be additional significant deposit insurance premium increases, special assessments or prepayments in order to restore the insurance fund\u2019s reserve ratio. Any significant premium increases or special assessments could have a material adverse effect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe cannot predict the substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulation, or the application thereof. Compliance with such current and potential regulation and scrutiny will significantly increase our costs, impede the efficiency of our internal business processes, may require us to increase our regulatory capital and may limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner. In response, we may be required to or choose to raise additional capital, which could have a dilutive effect on the existing holders of our common stock and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nChanges in accounting standards may impact how we report our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. From time to time, the FASB changes the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in a restatement of prior period financial statements.\nA natural disaster or recurring energy shortage, especially in California, could harm our business.\nHistorically, California has been vulnerable to natural disasters. Therefore, we are susceptible to the risks of natural disasters, such as earthquakes, wildfires, droughts, floods and mudslides. Natural disasters could harm our operations directly through interference with communications, including the interruption or loss of our websites, which would prevent us from gathering deposits, originating loans and processing and controlling our flow of business, as well as through the destruction of facilities and our operational, financial and management information systems. California has also historically experienced energy shortages, which, if they recur, could impair the value of the real estate in those areas affected.\nAlthough we have implemented several back-up systems and protections and maintain business interruption insurance, these measures may not protect us fully from the effects of a natural disaster. The occurrence of natural disasters or energy shortages in California could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, and this may make it difficult for you to resell shares of common stock owned by you at times or at prices you find attractive.\nStock price volatility may make it difficult for you to resell your common stock at the time and prices you find attractive. Our stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors including, among other things:\n\u25cf\nActual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of operations;\n\u25cf\nRecommendations by securities analysts;\n\u25cf\nOperating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u25cf\nNews reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the financial services industry, including the failures of other financial institutions in the current economic downturn;\n\u25cf\nPerceptions in the marketplace regarding the Company and/or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nPublic sentiments toward the financial services and banking industry generally;\n\u25cf\nNew technology used, or services offered, by competitors;\n\u25cf\nSignificant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving the Company or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nChanges in government regulations; and\n\u25cf\nGeopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts.\nGeneral market fluctuations, industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events, such as economic slowdowns or recessions, interest rate changes or credit loss trends, could also cause our stock price to decrease regardless of operating results as evidenced by the recent volatility and disruption of capital and credit markets.\nOur common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Market under the trading symbol \u201cBOCH,\u201d but there has historically been low trading volumes in our common stock. The limited trading market for our common stock may cause fluctuations in the market value of our common stock to be exaggerated, leading to price volatility in excess of that which would occur in a more active trading market of our common stock. Future sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of the common stock. In addition, even if a more active market in our common stock develops, we cannot assure you that such a market will continue.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our articles of incorporation could make a third party acquisition of us difficult.\nIn order to approve a merger or similar business combination with the owner of 20% or more of our common stock (an \u201cInterested Shareholder\u201d), our Articles of Incorporation contain provisions that require a supermajority vote of 66.7% of the outstanding shares of the common stock (excluding the shares held by the Interested Shareholder or its affiliates). These provisions further require that the per share consideration to be paid in such a transaction would have to equal or exceed the greater of (1) the highest per share price paid by the Interested Shareholder (a) within two years of the transaction proposal announcement date, or (b) the date the Interested Shareholder acquired a 20% -plus ownership interest (if the acquisition occurred less than two years before the transaction announcement) and (2) the fair market value of the Common Stock on (a) the transaction proposal announcement date, or (b) the date the Interested Shareholder acquired a 20% -plus ownership interest (if the acquisition occurred less than two years before the transaction announcement).\nThe operation of these provisions could result in the Company becoming a less attractive target for a would-be acquirer. As a consequence, it is possible that shareholders would lose an opportunity to be paid a premium for their shares in an acquisition transaction.\nThere may be future sales or other dilutions of our equity which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe are not restricted from issuing additional shares of common stock, including securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive our common stock. In addition, we are not prohibited from issuing additional securities which are senior to our common stock. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend in part on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of any future offerings.\nShares of our common stock eligible for future sale, including those that may be issued in connection with our various stock option and equity compensation plans, in possible acquisitions, and any other offering of our common stock for cash, could have a dilutive effect on the market for our common stock and could adversely affect our market price. Our Articles of Incorporation authorize 50,000,000 shares of which 13,294,777 shares were outstanding as of December 31, 2014. There are 250,100 shares subject to common stock options outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of $5.83 per share. Any future issuances of shares of our common stock will be dilutive to existing shareholders.\nThe holders of our preferred stock and trust preferred securities have rights that are senior to those of our holders of common stock and that may impact our ability to pay dividends on our common stock to our common shareholders and reduce net income available to our common shareholders.\nAt December 31, 2014, our subsidiary TrustII had outstanding $10.3 million of trust preferred securities. These securities are effectively senior to shares of common stock due to the priority of the underlying junior subordinated debentures. As a result, we must make payments on our trust preferred securities before any dividends can be paid on our common stock; moreover, in the event of our bankruptcy, dissolution, or liquidation, the obligations outstanding with respect to our trust preferred securities must be satisfied before any distributions can be made to our shareholders. While we have the right to defer dividends on the trust preferred securities for a period of up to five years, if any such election is made, no dividends may be paid to our common or preferred shareholders during that time.\nOn September 28, 2011, the Company issued and sold 20,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock to the Treasury pursuant to the Treasury\u2019s SBLF program. The Series B Preferred Stock is entitled to receive non-cumulative dividends payable quarterly on each January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1. The dividend rate, is based upon the initial level of QSBL by the Bank and is fixed at the current rate of 1% through January 2016. If the Series B Preferred Stock remains outstanding beyond January 2016, the dividend rate will be fixed at 9%. This increase in the Series B Preferred Stock annual dividend rate could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and could also adversely affect our ability to pay dividends on our common shares. Management is currently evaluating options for potential repayment of the stock.\nSuch dividends are not cumulative, but the Company may only declare and pay dividends on its common stock (or any other equity securities junior to the Series B Preferred Stock) if it has declared and paid dividends for the current dividend period on the Series B Preferred Stock, and will be subject to other restrictions on its ability to repurchase or redeem other securities. In addition, if (1) the Company has not timely declared and paid dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock for six dividend periods or more, whether or not consecutive, and (2) shares of Series B Preferred Stock with an aggregate liquidation preference of at least $20 million are still outstanding, the Treasury (or any successor holder of Series B Preferred Stock) may designate two additional directors to be elected to the Company\u2019s Board of Directors.\nWe are a bank holding company and our only significant asset is our wholly owned bank subsidiary.We have no other source of funds other than dividends and other distributions from our subsidiary bank. As discussed in Note 20 Regulatory Capital in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this document, our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders will depend on the Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends to us.\nPotential Volatility of Deposits\nOur depositors could choose to withdraw their deposits from the Bank and then put them into alternative investments, causing an increase in our funding costs and reducing net interest income. Checking, savings and money market account balances can decrease when customers perceive that alternative investments, such as the stock market, as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. When customers move funds out of bank deposits into other investments, the Bank will lose a relatively low cost source of funds, thereby increasing our funding costs.\nAt December 31, 2014, time certificates of deposit in excess of $250,000 represented approximately 7% of the dollar value of the total deposits of the Company. As such, these deposits are considered volatile and could be subject to withdrawal. Withdrawal of a material amount of such deposits could adversely affect the liquidity of our profitability, business prospects, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe impact of Basel III is still uncertain.\nThe adoption of Basel III established, among other things, a new common equity Tier 1 minimum capital requirement (4.5% of risk-weighted assets), increased the minimum Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets requirement (from 4.0% to 6.0% of risk-weighted assets) and assigns a higher risk weight (150%) to exposures that are more than 90 days past due or are on nonaccrual status and to certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property. The final rule also requires the Bank to meet the capital conservation buffer requirements of an additional 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital in order to avoid constraints on capital distributions and certain bonus compensation for executive officers. The final rule became effective on January 1, 2015 with the capital conservation buffer requirement phased in beginning January 1, 2016 and ending January 1, 2019.\nThe application of these rules may result in lower returns on invested capital, require the raising of additional capital or require regulatory action if the Holding Company and Bank were unable to comply with such requirements. In addition, management may be required to modify its business strategy due to the changes to the asset risk weightings for risk-based capital calculations and the requirement to meet the capital conservation buffers. The imposition of liquidity requirements in connection with Basel III could also cause the Holding Company and the Bank to increase its holdings of liquid assets, change its business strategy, and make other changes to the terms of its funding. If the Holding Company and the Bank were unable to meet the capital conservation buffer requirements required in 2016, the Holding Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends to stockholders may also be limited.", "PERMNO": 90221, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "BOCH"}
