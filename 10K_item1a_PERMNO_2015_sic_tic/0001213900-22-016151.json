RISK FACTORS\nRisk Factor Summary\nThe following are some material risks, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition, operating results, or prospects.\n\u25cf Risks Related to our Business and our Industry\no If our products do not attain market acceptance among the medical community, our operations and profitability would be adversely affected;\no If we fail to meet standards pursuant to the newly revised Drug Administration Law, certain production lines will be suspended and our profitability would be adversely affected;\no We may be subject from time to time to product recalls initiated by us or by the NMPA. Product recalls could impose significant costs on us and adversely affect our ability to generate revenue;\no If we fail to develop new products with high profit margins and our high-profit-margin products are replaced by competitors\u2019 products, then our gross will be adversely affected;\no Most of our products are off-patent branded generics that can be manufactured and sold by other pharmaceutical manufacturers in the PRC which may increase the competition we face;\no If we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand recognition to maintain our competitive advantage, our reputation, business and operating results may be harmed;\no Reimbursement may not be available for our products, which could diminish our sales;\no The growth and success of our business depend on our ability to successfully market our principal products to hospitals and their selection for medicine purchases;\no Our future research and development projects may not be successful;\no We cooperate with research institutions and universities in the PRC for the research and development of certain new products and any failure of such research institutions to meet our timing and quality standards may pose impairment loss on our financial results and our failure to continue such collaborative arrangement could adversely affect our ability to develop new pharmaceuticals and our overall business prospects;\no We may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for any of the new products and failure to obtain these approvals could materially harm our business;\no New product development in the pharmaceutical industry is time-consuming and costly and has a low rate of successful commercialization;\no We may not be able to successfully identify and acquire new products or businesses;\no We rely on distributors for all of our revenues and failure to maintain relationships or to otherwise expand our distribution network would materially and adversely affect our business;\no We rely on a limited number of distributors for the majority of sales of our products;\no Our operations may be affected if we could not pass the Consistency Evaluation requirement issued by the State Council for any of our current existing products;\no We face risks related to health pandemics that could impact our sales and operating results;\no Our operations may be affected if we could not obtain raw materials from our current key suppliers on acceptable terms;\no We may not be able to effectively manage our employees and distribution network, and our reputation, business, prospects and brand may be materially and adversely affected by actions taken by our distributors and third party marketing firms;\no We have limited insurance coverage and may incur losses resulting from product liability claims, business interruptions or claims that could be covered by D&O Insurance;\no Our future liquidity needs are uncertain and we may need to raise additional funds in the future.\n\u25cf Risks Related to Doing Business in China\no Adverse changes in political and economic policies of the PRC government and PRC legal system could have material and adverse effects on the overall economic growth of China, which could reduce the demand for our services, materially and adversely affect our competitive position and limit our available legal protection;\no You may experience difficulties in bringing original actions in the PRC against our company or our management based on U.S. or other foreign laws;\no Because we receive substantially all of our revenue in Renminbi, which currently is not a freely convertible currency, we are subject to changes in the PRC\u2019s political and economic decisions, and the convertibility of the Renminbi is uncertain;\no We are subject to the environmental protection laws of the PRC that may be costly to comply with and may adversely affect our manufacturing operations;\no Compliance with China\u2019s new Data Security Law, Measures on Cybersecurity Review, Personal Information Protection Law (second draft for consultation), regulations and guidelines relating to the multi-level protection scheme and any other future laws and regulations may entail significant expenses and could materially affect our business;\no The approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (\u201cCSRC\u201d) may be required in connection with future offering under a PRC regulation adopted in August 2006, and, if required, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such approval;\no Although the audit report included in this prospectus was issued by U.S. auditors who are currently inspected by the PCAOB, if it is later determined that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate our auditor completely, investors would be deprived of the benefits of such inspection and our ordinary shares may be delisted or prohibited from trading;\n\u25cf Risks Related to our Common Stock\no If we issue additional shares of our capital stock, our stockholders will experience dilution in their stock;\no The issuance of our common stock in connection with the redemption of our Note, would cause substantial dilution, which could materially affect the trading price of our common stock and earnings per share.\no A large portion of our common stock is controlled by a small number of stockholders and as a result, these stockholders are able to influence and ultimately control the outcome of stockholder votes on various matters;\no We are likely to remain subject to \u201cpenny stock\u201d regulations and as a consequence there are additional sales practice requirements and additional warnings issued by the SEC;\no There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern;\no We do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock;\no Restrictions on the Use of Rule 144 by Shell Companies or Former Shell Companies.\nRisks Related to our Business and our Industry\nThe commercial success of our products depends upon the degree of their market acceptance among the medical community. If our products do not attain market acceptance among the medical community, our operations and profitability would be adversely affected.\nThe commercial success of our products depends upon the degree of market acceptance they achieve within the medical community, particularly among physicians and hospital administrators. Physicians may not prescribe or recommend our products to patients and procurement departments of hospitals may not purchase our products if physicians or hospital pharmacists do not find our products attractive. The acceptance and use of our products among the medical community will depend upon a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf perception of physicians, patients and others in the medical community as to the safety and effectiveness of our products;\n\u25cf the prevalence and severity of any side effects;\n\u25cf the pharmacological benefit of our products relative to competing products and products under development;\n\u25cf the efficacy and potential advantages of our products relative to competing products and products under development;\n\u25cf the relative convenience and ease of administration of our products;\n\u25cf the methods by which our pharmaceutical products may be delivered to patients;\n\u25cf the effectiveness of our education, marketing and distribution efforts and those of our distributors;\n\u25cf publicity concerning our products or competing products and treatments; and\n\u25cf the price of our products and competing products.\nIf we fail to meet standards pursuant to the newly revised Drug Administration Law, the production at certain of our production lines will be suspended and our operations and profitability would be adversely affected.\nAll of our existing production lines have met the GMP Standards which became effective as of March 1, 2011. On December 1, 2019 the newly revised Drug Administration Law (the \u201cNew Law\u201d) came into effect. One of the major amendments of the New Law is the cancellation of GMP certification. The New Law eliminated the requirement that drug administration authorities shall assess drug manufacture enterprises and drug trading enterprises, and issue assessment certificates. Instead, it requires that drug manufacturing enterprises and drug trading enterprises establish and improve the quality management systems of manufacture and trade of drugs, and ensure that the process of manufacturing and trading of drugs always meets all legal requirements. This means a stricter form of supervision is implemented comparing to the prior GMP certificates system.\nWhile all of our existing product lines are in full compliance with the GMP standards issued in 2011, in the event we fail to continually meet the requirements of the GMP and receive the deficiency feedback from any pilot inspection under the New Law, the production on such production line(s) could be suspended and our operations and profitability could be adversely affected.\nWe may be subject from time to time to product recalls initiated by us or by the NMPA. Product recalls could impose significant costs on us and adversely affect our ability to generate revenue.\nIn our business, we must comply with a variety of product safety and product testing regulations. In particular, our products are subject to, among other statutes and regulations, those issued by the NMPA. If the NMPA issues any notices to cease the production, sale and use of any of our products, we must comply with such requirements. As a result, we may incur significant costs in complying with cessation requirements, and our financial results could be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, concerns about potential liability or potential future changes in product safety regulations may lead us to voluntarily recall or otherwise discontinue selling selected products, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn March 2013, NMPA issued a nationwide notice (the \u201cNMPA Notice\u201d) for the cessation of the production, sale and use of Buflomedil effective immediately. The NMPA Notice was a result of the reevaluation done by the NMPA based on the indications from the recent Chinese and international research materials, which found that the risks of side effects to the nervous system and the cardiovascular system from Buflomedil have surpassed its clinical treatment benefits. The NMPA Notice was applicable to all the manufacturers and distributors in China who are in the business of the production and sale of Buflomedil related products. As a result, we no longer produce Buflomedil after 2013.\nRecalls may also harm our reputation, increase our costs and reduce our net sales. Governments and regulatory agencies in the markets where we manufacture and sell products may enact additional regulations relating to product safety and consumer protection in the future or take other actions that may adversely impact our business. The NMPA has the authority to revoke drug approvals previously granted and remove previously approved products from the market for various reasons.\nIf we fail to develop new products with profit margins and our high-profit-margin products are replaced by competitors\u2019 products, then our gross and net profits margins will be adversely affected.\nWe had gross profit margins of 3.6% for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to gross profit margins of 18.0% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The pharmaceutical market in the PRC remains very competitive, and there may be pressure to reduce sale prices of products without a corresponding decrease in the cost of sold products. To the extent that we fail to develop new products with high profit margins and our high-profit-margin products are replaced by our competitors\u2019 products, our gross profit margins and net profit margins will be adversely affected. In addition, three of our products are included in the National Essential Drug List (the \u201cEDL\u201d), which are subject to strict governmental price controls. Therefore, our gross profit margin and net profit margins could be adversely affected notwithstanding any increase in our revenues.\nOur products face substantial competition. Other companies may discover, develop, acquire or commercialize products earlier or more successfully than we do.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment. Our products compete with other products or treatments for diseases that treat similar medical conditions. Many of our products may compete against products that have lower prices, superior performance, greater ease of administration or other advantages. We would face enhanced competition if competitive products are added to the National Medical Insurance Program. Our inability to compete effectively could reduce sales or margins, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of our operations.\nSome of our competitors are actively engaging in research and development in areas in which we have products or in which we are developing new product or new indications for existing products. In the future, we expect that our products will compete with new drugs currently in development, drugs approved for other indications that may be approved for the same indications as those of our products and drugs approved for other indications that are used off-label. If alternatives to our products are dispensed or prescribed to patients, the volume of our competing products sold may decline or we may be required to lower the prices of our competing products to remain competitive, either of which could negatively impact our sales. In addition, an increasing number of foreign pharmaceutical companies have introduced their pharmaceutical products into the Chinese market. Competitive products introduced by these companies can also negatively impact our sales and results of operations.\nLarge Chinese state-owned and privately owned pharmaceutical companies and foreign-invested or foreign pharmaceutical companies may have greater clinical, research, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing, financial and human resources than we do. In addition, some of our competitors may have technical or competitive advantages over us with respect to the development of technologies and processes. These resources may make it difficult for us to compete with them to successfully discover, develop and market new products and for our current products to compete with new products or new product indications that these competitors may bring to market. There may also be significant consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry among our competitors. Alliances may develop among competitors, and these alliances may rapidly acquire significant market share.\nFurthermore, in order to gain market share in China, competitors may significantly increase their advertising expenditures and promotional activities or even engage in irrational or predatory pricing behavior. In addition, our competitors may engage in inappropriate competition or illegal acts, such as bribery. Third parties may actively engage in activities designed to undermine our brand name and product quality or to influence customer confidence in our products. Increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced margins and loss of market share, any of which could materially adversely affect our profit margins. We may not be able to compete effectively against current and future competitors.\nMost of our products are off-patent branded generics that can be manufactured and sold by other pharmaceutical manufacturers in the PRC which may increase the competition we face and reduce our business profitability.\nMost of our products are off-patent branded generic pharmaceuticals and are not protected by intellectual property rights. As a result, other pharmaceutical companies may sell equivalent products at a lower cost, and this might result in a commensurate loss in sales of our branded generic products or require us to lower our prices to compete. If other pharmaceutical companies sell pharmaceutical products that are similar to our unprotected products, we may face additional competition and our business and profitability may be adversely affected.\nOur business depends in part on our well-known Helpson brand name, and if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand recognition to maintain our competitive advantage, our reputation, business and operating results may be harmed.\nWe believe that market awareness of our Helpson brand has contributed significantly to the success of our business. We also believe that maintaining and enhancing the Helpson brand is critical to maintaining our competitive advantage. Although our sales and marketing staff will continue to further promote our brand to remain competitive, we may not be successful. If we are unable to further enhance our brand recognition and increase awareness of our products, or if we are compelled to incur excessive marketing and promotion expenses in order to maintain our brand awareness, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, our sales and results of operations could be adversely affected if the Helpson brand or our reputation is impaired by recalls or negative publicity for one of our branded products, or certain actions taken by our distributors, competitors, third-party marketing firms or relevant regulatory authorities.\nReimbursement may not be available for our products, which could diminish our sales or affect our ability to sell our products profitably.\nMarket acceptance and sales of our products also depend on a large extent on the reimbursement policies of the PRC government. The Ministry of Labor and Social Security of the PRC or provincial or local labor and social security authorities, together with other government authorities, review the inclusion or removal of drugs from the national medical insurance catalog or provincial or local medical insurance catalogs for the National Medical Insurance Program every other year, and catalogs under which a drug will be classified affects the amounts reimbursable to program participants for their purchases of those medicines. These determinations are made based on a number of factors, including price and efficacy. Generally, there are two catalogs, the National Insurance Catalogue (\u201cNIC\u201d) and the EDL on which a product can be included. The products selected for the EDL generally are selected from the NIC. A consumer can be reimbursed for the full cost of a medicine on the EDL and can be reimbursed for 80% to 90% of the cost of a medicine listed on the NIC. Our Cefalexin, Clarithromycin and Omeprazole products are currently included in the EDL. If government authorities decide to remove these products from the medicine catalogs, such removal may reduce the affordability of our products and change the public perception regarding our products, which, in turn, would adversely affect the sales of these products and reduce our net revenue. Furthermore, if we are unable to obtain approval from the relevant government authorities to include our new products in the national, provincial or local medicine catalogs, sales of our new products maybe materially and adversely affected.\nThe growth and success of our business depend on our ability to successfully market our principal products to hospitals and their selection in tender processes used by hospitals for medicine purchases.\nOur future growth and success significantly depend on our ability to successfully market our principal products to hospitals as prescription medicines. Approximately 80% of the end-customers of our products are hospitals. Hospitals may make bulk purchases of a medicine included in the national and provincial medicine catalogs only if that medicine is selected under a government-administered tender process. A hospital\u2019s interest in a particular medicine is evidenced by:\n\u25cf the inclusion of this medicine on the hospital\u2019s formulary, which establishes the scope of medicines physicians at this hospital may prescribe to their patients, and\n\u25cf the willingness of physicians at a hospital to prescribe this medicine to their patients.\nWe believe effective marketing efforts are critical in ensuring that hospitals and physicians are interested in purchasing our products. If our marketing efforts are not effective, hospital administrators may not want to include our products in their formularies or may remove them from their formularies, or physicians may not be interested in prescribing our products to their patients. As a result, we may find it difficult to maintain the existing level of sales of our products, and our revenues and profitability may decline.\nOur future research and development projects may not be successful.\nThe successful development of pharmaceutical products can be influenced by many factors. Products that appear to be promising in their early phases of research and development may fail to be commercially viable for various reasons, such as failing to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals. Additionally, the research and development process for new products for which we may obtain an approval certificate is long. The process of conducting basic research and various stages of tests and trials of a new product before obtaining an approval certificate and commercializing the product may require ten years or longer. A few of our product candidates are in the early stages of pre-clinical study and clinical trials and we must conduct a significant number of additional clinical trials before we can seek the regulatory approvals necessary to begin commercial production and sales of these products. We cannot guarantee that our future research and development projects will be successful or completed within their anticipated time frames or budgets, or that we will receive the necessary approvals from the relevant authorities for the production of these products, or that these newly-developed products will achieve commercial success.\nOur competitors may obtain approval for a competitive product before the product we are developing is approved. If this occurs, we may be precluded from getting approval until the competitor\u2019s monitoring period expires and realize little to no benefit from our research and development investment.\nEven if such products can be successfully commercialized, they may not achieve the level of market acceptance that we expect. Additionally, the pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapid changes in technology, constant enhancements of industry know-how and the frequent emergence of new products. Future technological improvements and continual product developments in the pharmaceutical market may render our existing products obsolete or affect their viability and competitiveness. Therefore, our future success will largely depend on our development capability, including our ability to improve our existing products, diversify our product range and develop new and competitively-priced products that meet the requirements of the changing market. Should we fail to respond to these frequent technological advances by failing to improve our existing products, develop new products in a timely manner, or have these products reach a desirable level of market acceptance, our business and profitability will be materially and adversely affected.\nWe cooperate with research institutions and universities in the PRC for the research and development of certain new products and any failure of such research institutions to meet our timing and quality standards may pose impairment loss on our financial results and our failure to continue such collaborative arrangement or enter into such new arrangements could adversely affect our ability to develop new pharmaceuticals and our overall business prospects.\nOur business strategy includes collaborating with third parties for the research and development of new products. We have maintained long-term cooperative relationships with a number of research institutions and universities in the PRC. These research institutions and universities used to collaborate with us in a number of research projects and certain of our products with approval certificates were developed by such research institutions. Any failure of such research institutions to meet the required quality standards and timetables set forth in their research agreements with us, or our inability to enter into additional research agreements with these research institutions on terms acceptable to us in the future, may have an adverse effect on our ability to develop new medicines and on our business prospects.\nWhile the Company may resume the development of these formulas in the future if sufficient funding and other favorable conditions arise, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to enter into agreements with new parties on terms acceptable to us. Our inability to enter into such agreements or our failure to maintain such arrangements could limit the number of new products that we develop and ultimately decrease our sources of future revenue.\nWe may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for any of the new products and failure to obtain these approvals could materially harm our business.\nAll new medicines must be approved by the NMPA before they can be marketed and sold in the PRC. The NMPA requires successful completion of clinical trials and demonstrated manufacturing capability before it grants approval. It often takes a number of years before a medicine can be ultimately approved by the NMPA. In addition, the NMPA and other regulatory authorities may apply new standards for safety, manufacturing, packaging, and distribution of future product candidates.\nComplying with such standards may be time-consuming and expensive and could result in delays in obtaining NMPA approval for our future product candidates, or possibly preclude us from obtaining NMPA approval altogether. For example, due to the enhanced criteria introduced during the implementation process of the trial of one of our products in the dried powder injectable and granule production lines in our old plant, the clinical trials lasted longer than originally expected. Furthermore, our future products may not be effective or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that may preclude us from obtaining regulatory approval and prevent or limit their commercial use. The NMPA and other regulatory authorities may not approve the products that we develop and even if we do obtain regulatory approvals, such regulatory approvals may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which we may market a product, which may limit the size of the market for such product.\nNew product development in the pharmaceutical industry is time-consuming and costly and has a low rate of successful commercialization.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to enhance our existing products and to develop new products. The development process for pharmaceutical products is complex and uncertain, as well as time-consuming and costly. Relatively few research and development programs produce a commercial product. A product candidate that appears promising in the early phases of development may fail to reach the market for a number of reasons, such as:\n\u25cf the failure to demonstrate safety and efficacy in preclinical and clinical trials;\n\u25cf the failure to obtain approvals for intended use from relevant regulatory bodies, such as the NMPA;\n\u25cf our inability to manufacture and commercialize sufficient quantities of the product economically; and\n\u25cf proprietary rights, such as patent rights, held by others to our product candidates and their refusal to sell or license such rights to us on reasonable terms, or at all.\nDelays in any part of the development process or our inability to obtain regulatory approval of our products could adversely affect our operating results by restricting or delaying our introduction of new products. Even if we successfully commercialize new products, these products may compete with our mature products and may result in a reduction in the sales volume of our mature product or vice versa. Failure to develop, obtain necessary regulatory clearances or approvals for or successfully commercialize or market potential new products or technologies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to successfully identify and acquire new products or businesses.\nIn addition to our own product development efforts, our growth strategy also relies on our acquisitions of new product candidates, products or businesses from third parties. Any future growth through acquisitions will be dependent upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and favorable terms and conditions. Even if such opportunities present themselves, we may not be able to successfully identify them. Moreover, other companies, many of which may have substantially greater financial, marketing and sales resources, are competing with us for the right to acquire such product candidates, products or businesses.\nWe rely on distributors for all of our revenues and failure to maintain relationships with our distributors or to otherwise expand our distribution network would materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe sell our products exclusively to pharmaceutical distributors in the PRC and rely on distributors for all of our revenues. We have business relationships with over 1,000 distributors in the PRC. For the year ended December 31, 2021, no customer accounted for more than 10.0% of sales, and three customers accounted for 52.1%, 11.2%, and 10.2% of accounts receivable. In line with industry practices in the PRC, we enter into written sales agreements with our distributors. However, such sales agreements are not in substance equivalent to a typical distribution agreement in the United States. Each sales agreement is more in the form of a sales order and specifies one or several purchases of one or more products without any continuing obligation to purchase any additional amount of products. In the event certain distributors choose not to continue their relationship with us after completing their existing sales agreements, they can do so without breaching any contract or agreement, our financial results could be adversely affected if we cannot find the substantially similar distributors in time under such circumstances. In addition, some of our distributors may sell products that compete with our products. We compete for desired distributors with other pharmaceutical manufacturers, many of which may have higher visibility, greater name recognition, financial resources, and broader product selection than we do. Consequently, maintaining relationships with existing distributors and replacing distributors may be difficult and time-consuming. Any disruption of our distribution network, including our failure to renew our existing distribution agreements with our desired distributors, could negatively affect our ability to effectively sell our products and would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on a limited number of distributors for the majority of sales of our products.\nWe rely on a limited number of distributors for most of our net revenue. Our top five distributors in the aggregate accounted for 21% and 16% of our net revenues in 2021 and 2020, respectively. We expect that a relatively small number of distributors will continue to account for a major portion of our net revenue in the near future. Our dependence on a few distributors may expose us to the risk of substantial losses if a single large distributor stops purchasing our products, purchases lower quantities of our products or goes out of business and we cannot find substitute distributors on equivalent terms. If any of our large distributors reduces the quantity of the products, they purchase from us or stops purchasing from us, our net revenue would be materially and adversely affected.\nOur operations may be affected if we could not pass the Consistency Evaluation requirement issued by the State Council for any of our current existing products.\nGeneric drugs refer to drugs with the same active ingredient, dosage form, delivery channel and therapeutic effects compared to the original drugs. The \u201cConsistency Evaluation\u201d requires currently marketed generic products to prove their consistency in term of quality and therapeutic effect, and substitutability during clinical trials with original drug. The Consistency Evaluation could enhance the development of pharmaceutical industry, ensure drug safety and effectiveness, promote the upgrading and restructuring the pharmaceutical industry, and improve international competitiveness. Both Relevant Matters Related to the Implementation of the Opinions of the General Office of the State Council on the Consistent Evaluation of the Quality and Efficacy of Generic Drugs (No. 106 of 2016) issued on 26 May 2016, and Announcement of the General Administration on the Consistency Evaluation of the Quality and Efficacy of Generic Drugs (No. 100 of 2017) issued on August 28, 2017 require that if a drug has more than 3 manufacturers passed the consistency evaluation, then the drug manufacturers without consistency evaluation valid status will have no access to participate in the drug Centralized Procurement. NMPA issued an official document on The Implementation of the Evaluation of the Quality and Efficacy of Chemical Injection Generics on May 14, 2020, requiring consistent evaluation for generics of pharmaceutical injections that are already on the market. If we fail to complete the consistency evaluations for our generic drugs per the government\u2019s requirements, our business and operation will be negatively impacted.\nWe face risks related to health pandemics that could impact our sales and operating results.\nIn December 2019, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission first reported the appearance of COVID-19 in the city. Since then, COVID-19 has spread to other regions of China. As the COVID-19 continued to spread, different cities in China took different measures, including implementing complete or partial lockdowns. Meanwhile, the 2020 Chinese Lunar New Year holidays were extended in order to curb the spread of the virus, resulting in insufficient work force and delayed production for many industries. These preventative measures have also impacted our daily operations. The efforts enacted to control COVID-19 have placed heavy pressure on our marketing, promotional and sales activities. Part of our salesforce were unable to return to work due to lockdowns implemented in various cities, and some hospitals were restricting entrance to hospital staffs and patients only. These measures have had adverse impact on our marketing efforts and access to potential clients, rendering client conversion extremely challenging. As the COVID-19 spread across different countries and regions, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020. The negative economic impact brought forth by the COVID-19 pandemic has affected numerous industries and further erodes already weak consumer sentiment.\nAlthough our operating markets in China has adopted various infection prevention and control measures implemented by the PRC government for COVID-19 that turn out to be relatively effective, it is yet difficult to estimate how long will it take to restore people\u2019s normal lives, or whether certain measures will become part of a new norm. With vaccination rate gradually increases in China, the impact from COVID-19 may be alleviated. While the world is facing various challenges in response to COVID-19, China may continue to tighten its anti-pandemic policies and measures, which would add further headwinds to the recovery pace of China\u2019s economy and consumer confidence. In light of the rapidly changing situation across different countries and regions, it remains difficult to estimate the duration and magnitude of COVID-19 impact. There is considerable uncertainty over the long-term effects of the expansionary monetary and fiscal policies that have been adopted by the central banks and financial authorities of some of the world\u2019s leading economies to counter the negative economic impact brought forth by COVID-19, which could have lasting effects on our business, our expansion plans and our ability to raise capital required to implement our expansion plans, the extent of which is difficult to predict. While the impact of COVID-19 is not yet quantifiable, we expect this situation may have a material adverse impact on our operating results in the coming quarters and possibly in future years depending on the length of the pandemic and its economic repercussions. We will continue to assess the related risks and impacts COVID-19 pandemic may have on our business and our financial performance.\nOur operations may be affected if we could not obtain raw materials from our current key suppliers on acceptable terms.\nWe need a supply of a wide variety of raw materials to manufacture our products. Currently, we rely on numerous suppliers in the PRC and overseas to deliver our required raw materials. We have at least three principal suppliers for each of our most critical raw materials. For the year ended December 31, 2021, three suppliers accounted for 24.8%, 12.7%, and 11.8% of raw material purchases and for the year ended December 31, 2020, three suppliers accounted for 20.7%, 17.7%, and 13.5% of raw material purchases.\nHistorically, we have not had difficulty obtaining raw materials from suppliers. However, besides the impact that may be caused by the coronavirus outbreak discussed above, we cannot predict the impact on our suppliers of the current economic environment and other developments in their respective businesses, either. Insolvency, financial difficulties or other factors may result in our suppliers not being able to fulfill the terms of their agreements with us. Furthermore, such factors may render suppliers unwilling to extend contracts that provide favorable terms to us or may force them to seek to renegotiate existing contracts. Although we believe we have alternative sources of supply for the raw materials used in our business, termination of our relationships with any of our key suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations in the unlikely event that we are unable to obtain adequate raw materials from other sources in a timely manner or at all.\nWe may not be able to effectively manage our employees and distribution network, and our reputation, business, prospects and brand may be materially and adversely affected by actions taken by our distributors and third party marketing firms.\nWe have limited ability to manage the activities of our distributors and third-party marketing firms that we contract to promote our products and brand name, which are independent from us. Our distributors and third-party marketing firms could take one or more of the following actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects and brand:\n\u25cf sell our products outside their designated territory, possibly in violation of the exclusive distribution rights of other distributors;\n\u25cf fail to adequately promote our products;\n\u25cf promote competing products in lieu of our products; or\n\u25cf violate the anti-corruption laws of China, the United States or other countries.\nAdditionally, although our company policies prohibit our employees from making improper payments to hospitals or otherwise engaging in improper activities to influence the procurement decisions of hospitals, we may not be able to effectively manage our employees, as the compensation of our sales and marketing personnel is partially linked to their sales performance. As a result, we cannot assure you that our employees will not violate the anticorruption laws of the PRC, the United States and other countries. Such violations could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, prospects and brand.\nFailure to adequately manage our employees, distribution network or third-party marketing firms, or their non-compliance with employment, distribution or marketing agreements could harm our corporate image among hospitals and end users of our products and disrupt our sales, resulting in a failure to meet our sales goals. Furthermore, we could be liable for actions taken by our employees, distributors or third-party marketing firms, including any violations of applicable law in connection with the marketing or sale of our products, including China\u2019s anticorruption laws and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of the United States, or the FCPA. In particular, if our employees, distributors or third-party marketing firms make any payments that are forbidden under the FCPA, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties imposed by the U.S. government.\nRecently, the PRC government has increased its anti-corruption measures. In the pharmaceutical industry, corrupt practices include, among others, acceptance of kickbacks, bribes or other illegal gains or benefits by hospitals and medical practitioners from pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors in connection with the prescription of certain pharmaceuticals. Our employees, affiliates, distributors or third-party marketing firms may violate these laws or otherwise engage in illegal practices with respect to their sales or marking of our products or other activities involving our products. If our employees, affiliates, distributors or third-party marketing firms violate these laws, we could be required to pay damages or fines, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, PRC laws regarding the types of payments to promote or sell our products that are impermissible are not always clear. As a result, we, our employees, affiliates, our distributors or third-party marketing firms could make certain payments in connection with the promotion or sale of our products or other activities involving our products which at the time could be reasonably determined to be legal but are later deemed impermissible by the PRC government. Furthermore, our brand and reputation, our sales activities or the price of our common stock could be adversely affected if we become the target of any negative publicity as a result of actions taken by our employees, affiliates, distributors or third-party marketing firms.\nWe have limited insurance coverage and may incur losses resulting from product liability claims, business interruptions or claims that could be covered by D&O Insurance.\nThe nature of our business exposes us to the risk of product liability claims that is inherent in the research and development, manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical products. Using product candidates in clinical trials also exposes us to product liability claims. These risks are greater for our products that receive regulatory approval for commercial sale. Even if a product is approved for commercial use by an appropriate governmental agency, there can be no assurance that users will not claim effects other than those intended resulted from the use of our products. While no material claim for personal injury resulting from allegedly defective products has been brought against us to date, a substantial claim or a substantial number of claims, if successful, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Such lawsuits may divert the attention of our management from our business strategies, may be costly to defend and may negatively impact our reputation and our Helpson brand\u2019s reputation, and may harm the sales of our other branded products. In addition, product liability insurance for pharmaceutical products is not available in the PRC. In the event of allegations that any of our products are harmful, we may experience reduced consumer demand for our products or our products may be recalled from the market. We may also be forced to defend lawsuits and, if unsuccessful, to pay a substantial amount in damages, legal fees, and other related expenses. In addition, business interruption insurance available in the PRC offers limited coverage compared to that offered in many other countries. We do not have any business interruption insurance. Any business disruption or natural disaster could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources. Lastly, we currently do not have directors and officers insurance. In the event we or any of our directors or officers are sued under any proceedings or actions that could be covered by a standard D&O insurance, we may incur substantial costs and expenses to defend such case.\nOur future liquidity needs are uncertain and we may need to raise additional funds in the future.\nBased on our current operating plans, we expect our existing resources to be sufficient to fund our existing operations for at least 12 months. However, we may need to raise additional funds to expand our operations. In addition, we may need to raise additional funds if our expenditures exceed our current expectations. This could occur for a number of reasons, including:\n\u25cf we decide to devote significant amount of financial resources to the development of products that we believe to have significant commercialization potential;\n\u25cf we decide to acquire or license rights to additional product candidates or new technologies;\n\u25cf some of our product candidates fail in clinical trials or pre-clinical studies or prove not to be as commercially promising as we expected, and we are forced to develop or acquire additional product candidates;\n\u25cf Some of our product candidates require more extensive clinical or pre-clinical testing or clinical trials for these product candidates take longer to complete than we currently expect; or\n\u25cf we decide or are required to conduct more high-throughput screening than expected against current or additional disease targets to develop additional product candidates.\nOur ability to raise additional funds in the future is subject to a variety of uncertainties, including:\n\u25cf our future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows;\n\u25cf general market conditions for capital-raising activities by pharmaceutical companies; and\n\u25cf economic, political and other conditions in China and elsewhere.\nWe cannot assure you that our revenues will be sufficient to meet our operational needs and capital requirements. If we need to obtain external financing, we cannot assure you that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Our future liquidity needs and other business reasons could require us to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain a credit facility. The sale of additional equity or equity-linked securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of additional indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations.\nThe failure to manage growth effectively could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of our operations.\nThe rapid market growth of our pharmaceutical products may require us to expand our employee base for managerial, operational, financial and other purposes. As of December 31, 2021, we had 246 employees. Our future development will impose significant responsibilities upon the members of management to identify, recruit, maintain, integrate and motivate new employees. Aside from the increased difficulties in the management of human resources, we may also encounter working capital issues, as we need increased liquidity to finance the purchases of raw materials and supplies, drug formulas for new products, investment in research and development, acquisition of new businesses and technologies, and the hiring of additional employees. For effective growth management, we will be required to continue improving our operations, management, and financial systems and control. Our failure to manage growth effectively may lead to operational and financial inefficiencies that will have a negative effect on our profitability.\nWe depend upon key employees and consultants in a competitive market for skilled personnel. If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, it could adversely affect our ability to develop and market our products.\nWe are highly dependent upon the principal members of our management team, especially Ms. Zhilin Li, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. The loss of Ms. Li\u2019s services would adversely affect our ability to develop and market our products. We also depend in part on the continued services of our key scientific personnel and our ability to identify, hire and retain additional personnel, including marketing and sales staff. We face intense competition for qualified personnel, and the existence of noncompetition agreements between prospective employees and their former employers may prevent us from hiring those individuals or subject us to suit from their former employers. While we attempt to provide competitive compensation packages to attract and retain key personnel, many of our competitors are likely to have greater resources and more experience than we have, making it difficult for us to compete successfully for key personnel.\nCertain of our employees and consultants were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors, or at universities or other research institutions. Although there is currently no claim against us, we may be subject to claims that these employees or consultants have, inadvertently or otherwise, used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. It may be necessary to for us to litigate and defend against these claims. Even if we successfully defend against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to our management. If we fail to defend such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel.\nPower shortages, natural disasters, terrorist acts or other calamities could disrupt our production and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nAll of our products are produced at our manufacturing facility in Hainan, China. A significant disruption at that facility, even on a short-term basis, could impair our ability to timely produce and ship products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. Our manufacturing operations are vulnerable to interruption and damage from natural and other types of disasters, including earthquake, fire, floods, environmental accidents, power loss, communications failures and similar events. If any disaster were to occur, our ability to operate our business at our facilities would be seriously impaired. For example, a once-in-forty-year 16 grade super typhoon Rammasun hit Haikou on July 18, 2014, which caused us approximately $2.3 million (RMB14.2 million) in losses. Part of a warehouse was flooded, some damage was caused to our new facility, and the water and electricity supply was suspended for several days, causing a brief halt to our production activities and a delay in our obtaining GMP certification.\nIn addition, we do not maintain any insurance other than property insurance for some of our buildings, vehicles and equipment. Accordingly, unexpected business interruptions resulting from disasters could disrupt our operations and thereby result in substantial costs and diversion of resources. Our production process requires a continuous supply of electricity. We have encountered power shortages historically due to restricted power supply to industrial users during summers when the usage of electricity is high and supply is limited or as a result of damage to the electricity supply network. Because the duration of those power shortages was brief, they had no material impact on our operations. Longer interruptions of electricity supply could result in lengthy production shutdowns, increased costs associated with restarting production and the loss of production in progress. Any major suspension or termination of electricity or other unexpected business interruptions could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe cannot guarantee the protection of our intellectual property rights, and if infringement or counterfeiting of our intellectual property rights occurs, then our reputation and business may be adversely affected.\nTo protect the brand names of our products, we have registered and applied for registration of certain of our trademarks in the PRC. Currently eight of the 19 pharmaceutical products we manufacture are marketed under a brand registered as a trademark in China. We also purchased a pharmaceutical compound from a third party that we are seeking to develop into a further product. To date, we have not experienced any infringements of our trademarks for sales of pharmaceutical products or our exclusive patent license, and we are not aware of any infringement of our intellectual property rights. However, there is no guarantee that there will not be any infringements of our brand name or other registered trademarks or counterfeiting of our products in the future. There is no guarantee that there will not be any third-party infringement of our patents. Should any such infringement or counterfeiting occur, our reputation and business may be adversely affected. We may also incur significant expenses and substantial amounts of time and effort to protect our intellectual property rights in the future. Such diversion of our resources may adversely affect our existing business and future expansion plans.\nLitigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the intellectual property rights of others. However, because the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights in the PRC are uncertain and still evolving, we may not be successful in prosecuting these cases. In addition, any litigation or proceeding or other efforts to protect our intellectual property rights could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources and could seriously harm our business and operating results. Furthermore, the degree of future protection of our proprietary rights is uncertain and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage. If we are unable to protect our trade names, trade secrets and other propriety information from infringement, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Doing Business in China\nAdverse changes in political and economic policies of the PRC government could have a material and adverse effect on the overall economic growth of China, which could reduce the demand for our services and materially and adversely affect our competitive position.\nWe conduct substantially all of our business and have historically derived all of our revenues in China. Accordingly, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects are affected significantly by economic, political and legal developments in China. The Chinese economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including:\n\u25cf the degree of government involvement;\n\u25cf the level of development;\n\u25cf the growth rate;\n\u25cf the control of foreign exchange;\n\u25cf access to financing; and\n\u25cf the allocation of resources.\nWhile the Chinese economy has experienced significant growth in the past 30 years, growth has been uneven, both geographically and among various sectors of the economy. The Chinese economy has also experienced certain adverse effects due to the recent global financial crisis. The Chinese government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources. Some of these measures benefit the overall Chinese economy, but may also have a negative effect on us. For example, our operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations that are applicable to us, and by government policies or guidance aimed at curtailing the perceived over-capacity of certain industry sectors, such as pharmaceutical companies. The Chinese government has implemented certain measures, including interest rate increases, to control the pace of economic growth. These measures may cause decreased economic activity in China, which could in turn reduce the demand for our products and materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nChina\u2019s economy has been transitioning from a planned economy to a more market-oriented economy. Although in recent years the Chinese government has implemented measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform, the reduction of state ownership of productive assets and the establishment of sound corporate governance in business enterprises, a substantial portion of the productive assets in China is still owned by the Chinese government. The continued control of these assets and other aspects of the national economy by the Chinese government could materially and adversely affect our business.\nThe Chinese government also exercises significant control over China\u2019s economic growth through the allocation of resources, controlling payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies.\nAny adverse change in the economic conditions or government policies in China could have a material and adverse effect on overall economic growth and the level of investments in health industries in China, which in turn could lead to a reduction in demand for our products and consequently have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nThe PRC legal system has inherent uncertainties that could limit the legal protections available to us.\nThe PRC legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes. Unlike common law systems, it is a system in which decided legal cases have little precedential value. In the late 1970s, the PRC government began to promulgate a comprehensive system of laws and regulations governing commercial matters. The overall effect of legislation enacted over the past 20 years has significantly enhanced the protections afforded to foreign-invested enterprises in China. However, these laws, regulations and legal requirements are relatively recent and are evolving rapidly, and their interpretation and enforcement involve uncertainties. These uncertainties could limit the legal protections available to foreign investors.\nThe practical effect of the PRC legal system on our business operations in China can be viewed as two separate but intertwined considerations. First, as a matter of substantive law, the Foreign Invested Enterprise laws provide significant protection from government interference. In addition, these laws guarantee the full benefit of corporate articles and contracts to Foreign Invested Enterprise participants. These laws, however, do impose standards concerning corporate formation and governance that are not qualitatively different from the corporation laws found in the United States. Similarly, PRC accounting laws mandate accounting practices that may not be consistent with the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. PRC accounting laws require that an annual \u201cstatutory audit\u201d be performed in accordance with PRC accounting standards and that the account books of a foreign invested enterprise be maintained in accordance with PRC accounting laws. Article 14 of the PRC Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprise Law requires a wholly foreign-owned enterprise to submit certain periodic fiscal reports and statements to designated financial and tax authorities. If a foreign-invested enterprise refuses to keep account books in China, the financial and tax authorities may impose a fine on it, and the industry and commerce administration authority may order it to suspend operations or may revoke its business license.\nSecond, while the enforcement of substantive rights may be less clear than United States procedures, foreign-invested enterprises and foreign wholly-owned enterprises are PRC registered companies that enjoy the same status as other PRC registered companies in business-to-business dispute resolutions. The PRC legal infrastructure, however, is significantly different in operation from its United States counterpart, and may present a significant impediment to the operation of a foreign invested enterprise.\nPRC economic reform policies or nationalization could result in a total investment loss in our common stock.\nSince 1979, the PRC government has been reforming its economic policies. Because many reforms are unprecedented or experimental, they are expected to be refined and improved over time. Other political, economic and social factors, such as political changes, changes in the economic growth rates, unemployment or inflation, or in the disparities in per capita wealth between regions within China, could lead to further readjustment of the reform measures. This refinement and readjustment process may negatively affect our operations.\nAlthough the PRC government owns the majority of productive assets in China, in the past several years the government has implemented economic reform measures that emphasize decentralization and encourage private economic activity. Because these economic reform measures may be inconsistent or ineffectual, there are no guarantees that:\n\u25cf We will be able to capitalize on economic reforms;\n\u25cf The PRC government will continue its pursuit of economic reform policies;\n\u25cf The economic policies, even if pursued, will be successful;\n\u25cf Economic policies will not be significantly altered from time to time; or\n\u25cf Business operations in China will not become subject to the risk of nationalization.\nOver the last few years, China\u2019s economy has registered high growth rates. Recently, there have been indications that rates of inflation have increased. In response, the Chinese government recently has taken measures to curb this excessively expansive economy. These measures have included restrictions on the availability of domestic credit, reducing the purchasing capability of some of its customers, and limited recentralization of the approval process for purchases of certain foreign products. These austere measures alone may not succeed in slowing down the economy\u2019s excessive expansion or control inflation, and may result in severe dislocations in the Chinese economy. The PRC government may adopt additional measures to further combat inflation, including the establishment of freezes or restraints on certain projects or markets. These measures may adversely affect our operations.\nThere is no guarantee that the reforms to China\u2019s economic system will continue or that we will not be adversely affected by changes in China\u2019s political, economic, and social conditions and by changes in policies of the PRC government, such as changes in laws and regulations, measures which may be introduced to control inflation, changes in the rate or method of taxation, imposition of additional restrictions on currency conversion and remittance abroad, and reduction in tariff protection and other import restrictions.\nYou may experience difficulties in effecting service of legal process, enforcing foreign judgments or bringing original actions in the PRC against our company or our management based on U.S. or other foreign laws.\nOur operating subsidiary, Helpson, is incorporated under the laws of the PRC and substantially all of our assets are located in the PRC. Additionally, substantially all of our directors, executive officers and managers reside within the PRC, and substantially all assets of these persons are located within the PRC. As a result, it may not be possible to effect service of process within the United States or elsewhere outside the PRC upon certain of our directors, executive officers or managers, including with respect to matters arising under U.S. federal securities laws or applicable state securities laws. Moreover, the PRC does not have treaties providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments of courts with the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan or many other countries. As a result, recognition and enforcement in the PRC of judgments of a court in the United States and any of the other jurisdictions mentioned above in relation to any matter may be difficult or impossible. Furthermore, an original action may be brought in the PRC against us, our directors, executive officers or managers only if the actions are not required to be arbitrated by PRC law under Helpson\u2019s articles of association, and only if the facts alleged in the complaint give rise to a cause of action under PRC law. In connection with any such original action, a PRC court may impose civil liability, including monetary damages.\nAs a Foreign Invested Company in China, Helpson\u2019s ownership structure may be impacted by the foreign investment regulation and its measures in China.\nIn accordance with Decree No. 723 of the State Council of the People\u2019s Republic of China issued on December 26, 2019, the Regulations on the Implementation of the Foreign Investment Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China came into force on January 1, 2020. On December 28, 2020, the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Commerce publicly released the Directory of Industries to Encourage Foreign Investment (Encouraged Catalogue) (2020 Edition). On December 27, 2021, the National Development and Reform Commission of China (\u201cNDRC\u201d) and the Ministry of Commerce (\u201cMOFCOM\u201d) jointly issued the Special Administrative Measures for Foreign Investment Access (Negative List) (2021 Edition), and the Special Administrative Measures for Foreign Investment Access in Pilot Free Trade Zones (Negative List) (2021 Edition), effective January 1, 2022. As per these policies, the national negative list of foreign investment access was reduced from 33 to 31, and the negative list of foreign investment access in the FTZ was reduced from 30 to 27. Industries listed in the 2020 Encouraged Catalogue are the encouraged industries. On the other hand, industries listed in the 2021 Negative List are subject to special management measures. For example, establishment of wholly foreign-owned enterprises is generally allowed in industries outside of the 2021 Negative List. Also, foreign investors are not allowed to invest in industries that are expressly prohibited in the 2021 Negative List. The industries that are not expressly prohibited in the Negative List are still subject to government approvals and certain special requirements.\nThe majority of pharmaceutical manufacturing industry including the segments under which the Company conducts its business is not included in the 2020 Negative List. Helpson manufactures and markets generic and branded pharmaceutical products as well as biochemical products primarily to hospitals and private retailers located throughout the PRC. The Company believes Helpson\u2019s business is not subject to any ownership restrictions prescribed under the Catalogue. Onny acquired 100% of the ownership in Helpson on May 25, 2005, by entering into an Equity Transfer Agreement with Helpson\u2019s three former shareholders. The transaction was approved by the Commercial Bureau of Hainan Province on June 12, 2005 and Helpson received the Certificate of Approval for Establishment of Enterprises with Foreign Investment in the PRC on the same day. Helpson received its business license evidencing its WFOE (Wholly Foreign Owned Enterprise) status on June 21, 2005. However, in the event the 2020 Negative List is amended in the future to include any of the business Helpson is operating, our ownership structure could be subject to change to the extent our structure is not given any \u201cgrandfather\u201d protection.\nBecause we receive substantially all of our revenue in Renminbi, which currently is not a freely convertible currency, and the PRC government controls the currency conversion and the fluctuation of the Renminbi, we are subject to changes in the PRC\u2019s political and economic decisions.\nWe receive substantially all of our revenues in Renminbi, which currently is not a freely-convertible currency. The PRC government may, at its discretion, restrict access in the future to foreign currencies for current account transactions. Any future restrictions on currency exchanges may limit our ability to use revenue generated in Renminbi to fund any future business activities outside China or to make dividend or other payments in U.S. dollars. Although the Chinese government introduced regulations in 1996 to allow greater convertibility of the Renminbi for current account transactions, significant restrictions still remain, including primarily the restriction that foreign-invested enterprises may only buy, sell or remit foreign currencies, after providing valid commercial documents, at those banks authorized to conduct foreign exchange business. In addition, conversion of Renminbi for capital account items, including direct investment and loans, is subject to governmental approval in China, and companies are required to open and maintain separate foreign exchange accounts for capital account items.\nWe cannot be certain that the Chinese regulatory authorities will not impose more stringent restrictions on the convertibility of the Renminbi, especially with respect to foreign exchange transactions.\nFluctuation in the value of the Renminbi may have a material and adverse effect on your investment. The change in value of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar is affected by, among other things, changes in PRC\u2019s political and economic conditions. From 1995 until July 2005, the People\u2019s Bank of China intervened in the foreign exchange market to maintain an exchange rate of approximately Renminbi 8.3 per U.S. dollar. On July 21, 2005, the PRC government changed this policy and began allowing modest appreciation of the Renminbi versus the U.S. dollar. Under the new policy, the Renminbi was permitted to fluctuate within a narrow and managed band against a basket of certain foreign currencies. This change in policy caused the Renminbi to appreciate approximately 21.5% against the U.S. dollar over the following three years. As a consequence, the Renminbi has fluctuated sharply since July 2008 against other freely traded currencies, in tandem with the U.S. dollar. It is difficult to predict how long the current situation may last and when and how it may change again. There is significant international pressure on the PRC government to adopt a substantial liberalization of its currency policy, which could result in a further and more significant appreciation in the value of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar. Significant revaluation of the Renminbi may have a material adverse effect on your investment. For example, to the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars we receive from securities offering into Renminbi for our operations, appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar would have an adverse effect on the Renminbi amount we would receive from the conversion. Conversely, if we decide to convert our Renminbi into U.S. dollars for the purpose of making payments for dividends on our common stock or for other business purposes, appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Renminbi would have a negative effect on the U.S. dollar amount available to us. In August 2015, the PRC Government devalued its currency by approximately 3%, represented the largest yuan depreciation for 20 years. Concerns remain that China\u2019s slowing economy, and in particular its exports, will need a stimulus that can only come from further cuts in the exchange rate.\nIn addition, appreciation or depreciation in the value of the Renminbi relative to the U.S. dollar would affect our financial results reported in U.S. dollar terms without giving effect to any underlying change in our business or results of operations. The income statements of our operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in each applicable period. To the extent the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currencies denominated transactions results in reduced revenue, operating expenses and net income for our international operations. Similarly, to the extent the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions results in increased revenue, operating expenses and net income for our international operations. We are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as we convert the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars in consolidation. If there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates, the conversion of the foreign subsidiaries\u2019 financial statements into U.S. dollars will lead to a translation gain or loss, which is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. Very limited hedging transactions are available in China to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. To date, we have not entered into any hedging transactions. While we may enter into hedging transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these transactions may be limited, and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure at all.\nWe are subject to the environmental protection laws of the PRC that may be costly to comply with and may adversely affect our manufacturing operations.\nOur manufacturing process may produce by-products, such as effluent, gases and noise, which are harmful to the environment. We are subject to multiple laws governing environmental protection, such as \u201cThe Law on Environmental Protection in the PRC\u201d and \u201cThe Law on Prevention of Effluent Pollution in the PRC,\u201d as well as standards set by the relevant governmental bodies determining the classification of different wastes and proper disposal. We have properly attained a waste disposal permit for our manufacturing facility, which details the types and concentration of effluents and gases allowed for disposal. We are responsible for periodically renewing this waste disposal permit. There is no assurance that we will obtain a renewal of the waste disposal permit when the current permit expires in November 2022.\nChina is experiencing substantial problems with environmental pollution. Accordingly, it is likely that the national, provincial and local governmental agencies will adopt stricter pollution controls. There is no guarantee that future changes in environmental laws and regulations will not impose costly compliance requirements on us or otherwise subject us to future liabilities. Our business\u2019s profitability may be adversely affected if additional or modified environmental control regulations are imposed upon us.\nFailure to comply with PRC regulations regarding the registration requirements for employee equity incentive plans may subject our PRC citizen employees or us to fines and other legal or administrative sanctions.\nOn March 28, 2007, the SAFE promulgated the Application Procedure of Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Employee Stock Holding Plan or Share Option Plan of Overseas-Listed Company, which were superseded by Notice from SAFE regarding Issues related to Domestic Individual Participating Offshore Public Company Equity Incentive Plan promulgated on February 15, 2012 (\u201cSAFE #7\u201d) or the Share Option Rule. Under the Share Option Rule, PRC citizens who are granted stock options or other employee equity incentive awards by an overseas publicly-listed company are required, through a PRC agent who may be a PRC subsidiary of such overseas publicly-listed company, to register with the SAFE and complete certain other procedures related to the share options or other employee equity incentive plans. We and our PRC citizen employees who are granted share options or other equity incentive awards under our 2010 Long-Term Incentive Plan, or PRC optionees, are subject to the Share Option Rule. If we or our PRC optionees fail to comply with these regulations, we or our PRC optionees may be subject to fines and legal sanctions.\nU.S. regulatory bodies may be limited in their ability to conduct investigations or inspections of our operations in China.\nAny disclosure of documents or information located in China by foreign agencies may be subject to jurisdiction constraints and must comply with China\u2019s state secrecy laws, which broadly define the scope of \u201cstate secrets\u201d to include matters involving economic interests and technologies. There is no guarantee that requests from U.S. federal or state regulators or agencies to investigate or inspect our operations will be honored by us, by entities who provide services to us or with whom we associate, without violating PRC legal requirements, especially as those entities are located in China. Furthermore, under the current PRC laws, an on-site inspection of our facilities by any of these regulators may be limited or prohibited.\nThe enforcement of new labor contract law and its implementation rules and increase in labor costs in the PRC may adversely affect our business and our profitability.\nChina adopted the PRC Employment Contract Law, or the new Labor Contract Law, effective January 1, 2008 and the implementation rules effective September 18, 2008. The new Labor Contract Law and its implementation rules impose more stringent obligations on employers for, among others, entering into written employment contracts, hiring temporary employees, dismissing employees, setting compensations for dismissal and protecting certain sick or disabled employees from dismissal and setting forth detailed requirements relating to the contents of the employment contracts. The implementation of the new Labor Contract Law may increase our operating expenses, in particular our personnel expenses, as the continued success of our business depends significantly on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. In the event that we decide to terminate some of our employees or otherwise change our employment or labor practices, the new Labor Contract Law may also limit our ability to effect those changes in a manner that we believe to be cost-effective or desirable, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nPRC regulation of loans to and direct investment in PRC entities by offshore holding companies and governmental control of currency conversion may delay us from using the proceeds of this offering to make loans or additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business.\nAny funds the Company transfer to our PRC subsidiaries, either as a shareholder loan or as an increase in registered capital, are subject to approval by or registration with relevant governmental authorities in China. According to the relevant PRC regulations on foreign-invested enterprises, or FIEs, in China, capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries are subject to the approval of or filing with the Ministry of Commerce, or MOFCOM or its local branches and registration with a local bank authorized by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE. In addition, (i) a foreign loan of less one year duration procured by our PRC subsidiaries is required to be registered with SAFE or its local branches and (ii) a foreign loan of one year duration or more procured by our PRC subsidiaries is required to be applied to the NDRC in advance for undergoing recordation registration formalities. Any medium or long-term loan to be provided by us to our PRC operating subsidiaries, must be registered with the NDRC and the SAFE or its local branches. The Company may not be able to complete such registrations on a timely basis, with respect to future capital contributions or foreign loans by us to our PRC Subsidiary. If the Company fail to complete such registrations, our ability to use the proceeds of this offering and to capitalize our PRC operations may be negatively affected, which could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business.\nOn March 30, 2015, the SAFE promulgated the Circular on Reforming the Management Approach Regarding the Foreign Exchange Capital Settlement of Foreign-Invested Enterprises, or SAFE Circular 19, which took effect as of June 1, 2015. SAFE Circular 19 launched a nationwide reform of the administration of the settlement of the foreign exchange capitals of FIEs and allows FIEs to settle their foreign exchange capital at their discretion, but continues to prohibit FIEs from using the Renminbi fund converted from their foreign exchange capital for expenditure beyond their business scopes, providing entrusted loans or repaying loans between nonfinancial enterprises. The SAFE issued the Circular on Reforming and Regulating Policies on the Control over Foreign Exchange Settlement of Capital Accounts, or SAFE Circular 16, effective in June 2016. Pursuant to SAFE Circular 16, enterprises registered in China may also convert their foreign debts from foreign currency to Renminbi on a self-discretionary basis. SAFE Circular 16 provides an integrated standard for conversion of foreign exchange under capital account items (including but not limited to foreign currency capital and foreign debts) on a self-discretionary basis which applies to all enterprises registered in China. SAFE Circular 16 reiterates the principle that Renminbi converted from foreign currency-denominated capital of a company may not be directly or indirectly used for purposes beyond its business scope or prohibited by PRC laws or regulations, while such converted Renminbi shall not be provided as loans to its non-affiliated entities. As this circular is relatively new, there remains uncertainty as to its interpretation and application and any other future foreign exchange related rules. Violations of these Circulars could result in severe monetary or other penalties. SAFE Circular 19 and SAFE Circular 16 may significantly limit our ability to use Renminbi converted from the net proceeds of this offering to fund our PRC operating subsidiary, to invest in or acquire any other PRC companies through our PRC Subsidiary, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCompliance with China\u2019s new Data Security Law, Measures on Cybersecurity Review, Personal Information Protection Law (second draft for consultation), regulations and guidelines relating to the multi-level protection scheme and any other future laws and regulations may entail significant expenses and could materially affect our business.\nChina has implemented or will implement rules and is considering a number of additional proposals relating to data protection. China\u2019s new Data Security Law took effect in September 2021. The Data Security Law provides that the data processing activities must be conducted based on \u201cdata classification and hierarchical protection system\u201d for the purpose of data protection and prohibits entities in China from transferring data stored in China to foreign law enforcement agencies or judicial authorities without prior approval by the Chinese government.\nAdditionally, China\u2019s Cyber Security Law requires companies to take certain organizational, technical and administrative measures and other necessary measures to ensure the security of their networks and data stored on their networks. Specifically, the Cyber Security Law provides that China adopt a multi-level protection scheme (MLPS), under which network operators are required to perform obligations of security protection to ensure that the network is free from interference, disruption or unauthorized access, and prevent network data from being disclosed, stolen or tampered. Under the MLPS, entities operating information systems must have a thorough assessment of the risks and the conditions of their information and network systems to determine the level to which the entity\u2019s information and network systems belong-from the lowest Level 1 to the highest Level 5 pursuant to a series of national standards on the grading and implementation of the classified protection of cyber security. The grading result will determine the set of security protection obligations that entities must comply with. Entities classified as Level 2 or above should report the grade to the relevant government authority for examination and approval.\nRecently, the Cyberspace Administration of China has taken action against several Chinese internet companies in connection with their initial public offerings on U.S. securities exchanges, for alleged national security risks and improper collection and use of the personal information of Chinese data subjects. According to the official announcement, the action was initiated based on the National Security Law, the Cyber Security Law and the Measures on Cybersecurity Review, which are aimed at \u201cpreventing national data security risks, maintaining national security and safeguarding public interests.\u201d On July 10, 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China published a revised draft of the Measures on Cybersecurity Review, expanding the cybersecurity review to data processing operators in possession of personal information of over 1 million users if the operators intend to list their securities in a foreign country.\nIt is unclear at the present time how widespread the cybersecurity review requirement and the enforcement action will be and what effect they will have on our business. China\u2019s regulators may impose penalties for non-compliance ranging from fines or suspension of operations, and this could lead to us delisting from the U.S. stock market.\nAlso, recently, the National People\u2019s Congress released the Personal Information Protection Law, which has become effective on November 1, 2021. The law creates a comprehensive set of data privacy and protection requirements that apply to the processing of personal information and expands data protection compliance obligations to cover the processing of personal information of persons by organizations and individuals in China, and the processing of personal information of persons in China outside of China if such processing is for purposes of providing products and services to, or analyzing and evaluating the behavior of, persons in China. The law also provides that critical information infrastructure operators and personal information processing entities who process personal information meeting a volume threshold to-be-set by Chinese cyberspace regulators are also required to store in China personal information generated or collected in China, and to pass a security assessment administered by Chinese cyberspace regulators for any export of such personal information. Lastly, the draft contains proposals for significant fines for serious violations of up to RMB 50 million or 5% of annual revenues from the prior year and may also be ordered to suspend any related activity by competent authorities.\nInterpretation, application and enforcement of these laws, rules and regulations evolve from time to time and their scope may continually change, through new legislation, amendments to existing legislation and changes in enforcement. Compliance with the Cyber Security Law and the Data Security Law could significantly increase the cost to us of providing our service offerings, require significant changes to our operations or even prevent us from providing certain service offerings in jurisdictions in which we currently operate or in which we may operate in the future. Despite our efforts to comply with applicable laws, regulations and other obligations relating to privacy, data protection and information security, it is possible that our practices, offerings or platform could fail to meet all of the requirements imposed on us by the Cyber Security Law, the Data Security Law and/or related implementing regulations. Any failure on our part to comply with such law or regulations or any other obligations relating to privacy, data protection or information security, or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access, use or release of personally identifiable information or other data, or the perception or allegation that any of the foregoing types of failure or compromise has occurred, could damage our reputation, discourage new and existing counterparties from contracting with us or result in investigations, fines, suspension or other penalties by Chinese government authorities and private claims or litigation, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if our practices are not subject to legal challenge, the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation and brand and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, the legal uncertainty created by the Data Security Law and the recent Chinese government actions could materially adversely affect our ability, on favorable terms, to raise capital, including engaging in follow-on offerings of our securities in the U.S. market.\nThe approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (\u201cCSRC\u201d) may be required in connection with future offering under a PRC regulation adopted in August 2006, and, if required, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such approval.\nThe Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Companies by Foreign Investors, or the M&A Rules, adopted by six PRC regulatory agencies in 2006 and amended in 2009, require an overseas special purpose vehicle formed for listing purposes through acquisitions of PRC domestic companies and controlled by PRC companies or individuals to obtain the approval of the CSRC prior to the listing and trading of such special purpose vehicle\u2019s securities on an overseas stock exchange. In September 2006, the CSRC published a notice on its official website specifying documents and materials required to be submitted to it by a special purpose vehicle seeking CSRC approval of its overseas listings. However, substantial uncertainty remains regarding the scope and applicability of the M&A Rules to offshore special purpose vehicles. Currently, there is no consensus among leading PRC law firms regarding the scope and applicability of the CSRC approval requirement.\nBased on our understanding of the Chinese laws and regulations in effect at the time of this report, we will not be required to submit an application to the CSRC for its approval of an offering in a foreseeable future and the listing and trading of our common stock on Nasdaq. However, there remains some uncertainty as to how the M&A Rules will be interpreted or implemented in the context of an overseas offering and our belief is subject to any new laws, rules and regulations or detailed implementations and interpretations in any form relating to the M&A Rules or overseas offering approval. We cannot assure you that relevant PRC governmental agencies, including the CSRC, would reach the same conclusion as we do.\nRecently, the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the General Office of the State Council jointly issued the \u201cOpinions on Severely Cracking Down on Illegal Securities Activities According to Law,\u201d or the Opinions, which was made available to the public on July 6, 2021. The Opinions emphasized the need to strengthen the administration over illegal securities activities, and the need to strengthen the supervision over overseas listings by Chinese companies. Effective measures, such as promoting the construction of relevant regulatory systems will be taken to deal with the risks and incidents of China-concept overseas listed companies, and cybersecurity and data privacy protection requirements and similar matters. On July 10, 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China issued a revised draft of the Measures for Cybersecurity Review for public comments, which required that, among others, in addition to \u201coperator of critical information infrastructure\u201d, any \u201cdata processor\u201d controlling personal information of no less than one million users which seeks to list in a foreign stock exchange should also be subject to cybersecurity review, and further elaborated the factors to be considered when assessing the national security risks of the relevant activities. We do not believe we are among the \u201coperator of critical information infrastructure\u201d or \u201cdata processor\u201d as mentioned above. Based on the above and our understanding of the Chinese laws and regulations currently in effect as of the date of this report, we will not be required to submit an application to the CSRC or the CAC for the approval of a future offering and the listing and trading of our securities on the Nasdaq. However, the revised draft of the Measures for Cybersecurity Review is in the process of being formulated and the Opinions remain unclear on how it will be interpreted, amended and implemented by the relevant PRC governmental authorities. Thus, it is still uncertain how PRC governmental authorities will regulate overseas listing in general and whether we are required to obtain any specific regulatory approvals. Furthermore, if the CSRC or other regulatory agencies later promulgate new rules or explanations requiring that we obtain their approvals for future offering and any follow-on offering, we may be unable to obtain such approvals which could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to our investors. For instance, in the event that the CSRC approval or any regulatory approval is required for a future offering, or if the CSRC or any other PRC government authorities promulgates any new laws, rules or regulations or any interpretation or implements rules before our listing that would require us to obtain the CSRC or any other governmental approval for a future offering, we may face sanctions by the CSRC or other PRC regulatory agencies if we fail to seek CSRC approval for such future offering. These sanctions may include fines and penalties on our operations in the PRC, limitations on our operating privileges in the PRC, delays in or restrictions on the repatriation of the proceeds from a future offering into the PRC, restrictions on or prohibition of the payments or remittance of dividends by our PRC subsidiary, or other actions that could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and prospects, as well as the trading price of our common stock. The CSRC or other PRC regulatory agencies may also take actions requiring us, or making it advisable for us, to halt a future offering before the settlement and delivery of the securities that we offer. Consequently, if you engage in market trading or other activities in anticipation of and prior to the settlement and delivery of the securities we offer, you would be doing so at the risk that the settlement and delivery may not occur. Any uncertainties or negative publicity regarding such approval requirements could have a material adverse effect on our ability to complete any follow-on offering of our securities or the market for and market price of our common stock.\nOur auditor, BF Borgers CPA PC is headquartered in Lakewood, Colorado, and is subject to inspection by the PCAOB on a regular basis. To the extent that our independent registered public accounting firm\u2019s audit documentation related to their audit reports for our company become located in China, the PCAOB may not be able inspect such audit documentation and, as such, you may be deprived of the benefits of such inspection and our ordinary shares could be delisted from the stock exchange pursuant to the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act.\nAs auditors of companies that are traded publicly in the United States and a firm registered with the PCAOB, our auditor is required by the laws of the United States to undergo regular inspections by the PCAOB. However, to the extent that our auditor\u2019s work papers become located in China, such work papers will not be subject to inspection by the PCAOB because the PCAOB is currently unable to conduct inspections without the approval of the Chinese authorities. Inspections of certain other firms that the PCAOB has conducted outside of China have identified deficiencies in those firms\u2019 audit procedures and quality control procedures, which may be addressed as part of the inspection process to improve future audit quality. We are required by the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act to have an auditor that is subject to the inspection by the PCAOB. While our present auditor is located in the United States and the PCAOB is able to conduct inspections on such auditor, to the extent this status changes in the future and our auditor\u2019s audit documentation related to their audit reports for our company becomes outside of the inspection by the PCAOB, our ordinary shares could be delisted from the stock exchange pursuant to the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act.\nPRC regulations relating to the establishment of offshore special purpose companies by PRC residents may subject our PRC resident beneficial owners or our PRC subsidiary to liability or penalties, limit our ability to inject capital into our PRC subsidiary, limit our PRC subsidiary\u2019 ability to increase their registered capital or distribute profits to us, or may otherwise adversely affect us.\nIn July 2014, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Domestic Residents\u2019 Offshore Investment and Financing and Roundtrip Investment Through Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular 37, to replace the Notice on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Residents\u2019 Financing and Roundtrip Investment Through Offshore Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular 75, which ceased to be effective upon the promulgation of SAFE Circular 37. SAFE Circular 37 requires PRC residents (including PRC individuals and PRC corporate entities) to register with SAFE or its local branches in connection with their direct or indirect offshore investment activities. SAFE Circular 37 is applicable to our shareholders who are PRC residents and may be applicable to any offshore acquisitions that we make in the future.\nUnder SAFE Circular 37, PRC residents who make, or have prior to the implementation of SAFE Circular 37 made, direct or indirect investments in offshore special purpose vehicles, or SPVs, will be required to register such investments with SAFE or its local branches. In addition, any PRC resident who is a direct or indirect shareholder of an SPV is required to update its filed registration with the local branch of SAFE with respect to that SPV, to reflect any material change. Moreover, any subsidiary of such SPV in China is required to urge the PRC resident shareholders to update their registration with the local branch of SAFE. If any PRC shareholder of such SPV fails to make the required registration or to update the previously filed registration, the subsidiary of such SPV in China may be prohibited from distributing its profits or the proceeds from any capital reduction, share transfer or liquidation to the SPV, and the SPV may also be prohibited from making additional capital contributions into its subsidiary in China. On February 13, 2015, the SAFE promulgated a Notice on Further Simplifying and Improving Foreign Exchange Administration Policy on Direct Investment, or SAFE Notice 13, which became effective on June 1, 2015. Under SAFE Notice 13, applications for foreign exchange registration of inbound foreign direct investments and outbound overseas direct investments, including those required under SAFE Circular 37, will be filed with qualified banks instead of SAFE. The qualified banks will directly examine the applications and accept registrations under the supervision of SAFE.\nSome of our shareholders that we are aware of are subject to SAFE regulations, and we expect all of these shareholders will have completed all necessary registrations with the local SAFE branch or qualified banks as required by SAFE Circular 37. We cannot assure you, however, that all of these shareholders may continue to make required filings or updates in a timely manner, or at all. We can provide no assurance that we are or will in the future continue to be informed of identities of all PRC residents holding direct or indirect interest in our company. Any failure or inability by such shareholders to comply with SAFE regulations may subject us to fines or legal sanctions, such as restrictions on our cross-border investment activities or our PRC subsidiaries\u2019 ability to distribute dividends to, or obtain foreign exchange-denominated loans from, our company or prevent us from making distributions or paying dividends. As a result, our business operations and our ability to make distributions to you could be materially and adversely affected.\nFurthermore, as these foreign exchange regulations are still relatively new and their interpretation and implementation have been constantly evolving, it is unclear how these regulations, and any future regulation concerning offshore or cross-border transactions, will be interpreted, amended and implemented by the relevant government authorities. For example, we may be subject to a more stringent review and approval process with respect to our foreign exchange activities, such as remittance of dividends and foreign-currency-denominated borrowings, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if we decide to acquire a PRC domestic company, we cannot assure you that we or the owners of such company, as the case may be, will be able to obtain the necessary approvals or complete the necessary filings and registrations required by the foreign exchange regulations. This may restrict our ability to implement our acquisition strategy and could adversely affect our business and prospects.\nU.S. regulatory bodies may be limited in their ability to conduct investigations or inspections of our operations in China.\nAny disclosure of documents or information located in China by foreign agencies may be subject to jurisdiction constraints and must comply with China\u2019s state secrecy laws, which broadly define the scope of \u201cstate secrets\u201d to include matters involving economic interests and technologies. There is no guarantee that requests from U.S. federal or state regulators or agencies to investigate or inspect our operations will be honored by us, by entities who provide services to us or with whom we associate, without violating PRC legal requirements, especially as those entities are located in China. Furthermore, under the current PRC laws, an on-site inspection of our facilities by any of these regulators may be limited or prohibited.\nOur China-sourced income is subject to PRC withholding tax under the new Enterprise Income Tax Law of the PRC, and we may be subject to PRC enterprise income tax at the rate of 25% when more detailed rules or precedents are promulgated.\nThe PRC enterprise income tax is calculated based on the taxable income determined under the PRC laws and accounting standards. On March 16, 2007, the National People\u2019s Congress of China enacted a new Enterprise Income Tax Law of the PRC, which became effective on January 1, 2008 and amended the Enterprise Income Tax Law of the PRC on December 29, 2018. On December 6, 2007, the State Council promulgated the Implementation Rules to the Enterprise Income Tax Law of the PRC, or the Implementation Rules, which also became effective on January 1, 2008 and amended the Implementation Rules to the Enterprise Income Tax Law of the PRC on April 23, 2019. On December 26, 2007, the State Council issued the Notice on Implementation of Enterprise Income Tax Transition Preferential Policy under the Enterprise Income Tax Law of the PRC, or the Transition Preferential Policy Circular, which became effective simultaneously with the Enterprise Income Tax Law of the PRC. On October 17, 2017, the State Administration of Taxation promulgated the Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation on Issues Relating to Withholding at Source of Income Tax of Non-resident Enterprises, which became effective on December 1, 2017 and amended Withholding at Source of Income Tax of Non-resident Enterprises on June 15, 2018. The Enterprise Income Tax Law of the PRC imposes a uniform enterprise income tax rate of 25% on all domestic enterprises, including foreign-invested enterprises unless they qualify for certain exceptions, and terminates most of the tax exemptions, reductions and preferential treatments available under previous tax laws and regulations.\nMoreover, under the Enterprise Income Tax Law of the PRC, enterprises organized under the laws of jurisdictions outside China with their \u201cde facto management bodies\u201d located within China may be considered PRC resident enterprises and therefore subject to PRC enterprise income tax at the rate of 25% on their worldwide income. The Implementation Rules define the term \u201cde facto management body\u201d as the management body that exercises full and substantial control and overall management over the business, productions, personnel, accounts and properties of an enterprise. In addition, the Circular Related to Relevant Issues on the Identification of a Chinese holding Company Incorporated Overseas as a Residential Enterprise under the Criterion of De Facto Management Bodies Recognizing issued by the State Administration of Taxation on April 22, 2009 provides that a foreign enterprise controlled by a PRC company or a PRC company group will be classified as a \u201cresident enterprise\u201d with its \u201cde facto management bodies\u201d located within China if the following requirements are satisfied: (i) the senior management and core management departments in charge of its daily operations function mainly in China; (ii) its financial and human resources decisions are subject to determination or approval by persons or bodies in China; (iii) its major assets, accounting books, company seals and minutes and files of its board and shareholders\u2019 meetings are located or kept in China; and (iv) more than half of the enterprise\u2019s directors or senior management with voting rights reside in China. Although the circular only applies to offshore enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises and not those controlled by PRC individuals or foreigners, the determining criteria set forth in the circular may reflect the State Administration of Taxation\u2019s general position on how the \u201cde facto management body\u201d test should be applied in determining the tax resident status of offshore enterprises, regardless of whether they are controlled by PRC enterprises, individuals or foreigners. It is uncertain to us as to how it will be implemented and the respective tax base and the tax exposure cannot be determined reliably at this stage. In case we are required to pay the income tax on capital gains by the relevant PRC tax authorities, our financial conditions and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nDividends payable by us to our foreign investors and gain on the sale of our shares may become subject to taxes under PRC tax laws.\nUnder the new EIT law and its implementation rules, to the extent that we are considered a \u201cresident enterprise\u201d which is \u201cdomiciled\u201d in China, PRC income tax at the rate of 10% is applicable to dividends payable by us to investors that are \u201cnon-resident enterprises\u201d so long as such \u201cnon-resident enterprise\u201d investors do not have an establishment or place of business in China or, despite the existence of such establishment or place of business in China, the relevant income is not effectively connected with such establishment or place of business in China. Similarly, any gain realized on the transfer of our shares by such investors is also subject to a 10% PRC income tax if such gain is regarded as income derived from sources within China and we are considered a \u201cresident enterprise\u201d which is domiciled in China for tax purposes. Additionally, there is a possibility that the relevant PRC tax authorities may take the view that our purpose is that of a holding company, and the capital gain derived by our overseas stockholders would be deemed China-sourced income, in which case such capital gain may be subject to PRC withholding tax at the rate of up to 10%. If we are required under the new EIT law to withhold PRC income tax on our dividends payable to our foreign stockholders who are \u201cnon-resident enterprises\u201d, or if you are required to pay PRC income tax on the transfer of our shares under the circumstances mentioned above, the value of your investment in our shares may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe face uncertainty with respect to indirect transfers of equity interests in PRC resident enterprises by their non-PRC holding companies.\nOn February 3, 2015, the SAT issued the Public Notice Regarding Certain Corporate Income Tax Matters on Indirect Transfer of Properties by Non-Tax Resident Enterprises, or SAT Bulletin 7. SAT Bulletin 7 extends its tax jurisdiction to transactions involving the transfer of taxable assets through offshore transfer of a foreign intermediate holding company. In addition, SAT Bulletin 7 has introduced safe harbors for internal group restructurings and the purchase and sale of equity through a public securities market. SAT Bulletin 7 also brings challenges to both foreign transferor and transferee (or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer) of taxable assets, as such persons need to determine whether their transactions are subject to these rules and whether any withholding obligation applies.\nOn October 17, 2017, the SAT issued the Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation on Issues Concerning the Withholding of Non-resident Enterprise Income Tax at Source, or SAT Bulletin 37, which came into effect on December 1, 2017. The SAT Bulletin 37 further clarifies the practice and procedure of the withholding of non-resident enterprise income tax.\nWhere a non-resident enterprise transfers taxable assets indirectly by disposing of the equity interests of an overseas holding company, which is an \u201cIndirect Transfer\u201d, the non-resident enterprise as either transferor or transferee, or the PRC entity that directly owns the taxable assets, may report such Indirect Transfer to the relevant tax authority. Using a \u201csubstance over form\u201d principle, the PRC tax authority may disregard the existence of the overseas holding company if it lacks a reasonable commercial purpose and was established for the purpose of reducing, avoiding or deferring PRC tax. As a result, gains derived from such Indirect Transfer may be subject to PRC enterprise income tax, and the transferee or other person who pays for the transfer is obligated to withhold the applicable taxes currently at a rate of 10% for the transfer of equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise. Both the transferor and the transferee may be subject to penalties under PRC tax laws if the transferee fails to withhold the taxes and the transferor fails to pay the taxes.\nWe face uncertainties as to the reporting and other implications of certain past and future transactions where PRC taxable assets are involved, such as offshore restructuring, sale of the shares in our offshore subsidiaries and investments. Our company may be subject to filing obligations or taxed if our company is transferor in such transactions, and may be subject to withholding obligations if our company is transferee in such transactions, under SAT Bulletin 7 and/or SAT Bulletin 37. For transfer of shares in our company by investors who are non-PRC resident enterprises, our PRC subsidiaries may be requested to assist in the filing under SAT Bulletin 7 and/or SAT Bulletin 37. As a result, we may be required to expend valuable resources to comply with SAT Bulletin 7 and/or SAT Bulletin 37 or to request the relevant transferors from whom we purchase taxable assets to comply with these circulars, or to establish that our company should not be taxed under these circulars, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nThe market price for our common stock may be volatile which could result in a complete loss of your investment.\nThe market price for our common stock is highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors including the following:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u25cf announcements of new products by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf changes in financial estimates by securities analysts;\n\u25cf conditions in the pharmaceutical market;\n\u25cf changes in the economic performance or market valuations of other companies involved in pharmaceutical production;\n\u25cf announcements by our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u25cf economic, regulatory and political developments;\n\u25cf addition or departure of key personnel, or\n\u25cf potential litigation.\nIn addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are not related to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe may issue additional shares of our capital stock to raise additional cash for working capital; if we issue additional shares of our capital stock, our stockholders will experience dilution in their respective percentage ownership in the company.\nWe may issue additional shares of our capital stock to raise additional cash for working capital. There is no anti-dilution protection or preemptive rights in connection with our common stock. Thus, the percentage ownership of existing holders of common stock may be diluted in their respective percentage ownership in us if we issue additional shares of our capital stock.\nThe issuance of our common stock in connection with the redemption of our Note, would cause substantial dilution, which could materially affect the trading price of our common stock and earnings per share.\nPursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement the Company entered into on November 17, 2021, the Company issued a Note to an Investor. To the extent the Investor elects to redeem the Note and we agree to issue the common stock, substantial amounts of our common stock will be issued. The redemption price of the Note is equal to 85% multiplied by the lowest daily volume weighted average price during the ten trading days immediately preceding the applicable redemption conversion, subject to certain adjustments and ownership limitations specified in the Note. At inception, the Note was redeemable into 8,811,430 shares of the common stock based on the lowest volume weighted average price of $0.595817 on the inception date of November 19, 2021. Although we cannot predict the number of our common stock that will actually be issued in connection with any such redemptions, such issuances could result in substantial decreases to the Company\u2019s stock price and earnings per share. See \u201cNOTE 9 - CONVERTIBLE NOTE PAYABLE\u201d to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021 included in this report on Form 10-K for more information.\nA large portion of our common stock is controlled by a small number of stockholders and as a result, these stockholders are able to influence and ultimately control the outcome of stockholder votes on various matters.\nA large portion of our common stock is held by a small number of stockholders. For instance, Zhilin Li, our Chief Executive Officer, holds 29.2%, and Heung Mei Tsui, a member of our Board of Directors, holds 19.7% of our common stock, respectively, as of the date hereof. As a result, these two stockholders are able to significantly influence the outcome of stockholder votes on various matters, including the election of directors and other corporate transactions including business combinations. In addition, the occurrence of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock, or the perception that these sales could occur, may affect our stock price and could impair our ability to obtain capital through an offering of equity securities. Furthermore, the current ratios of ownership of our common stock reduce the public float and liquidity of our common stock which can in turn affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe are likely to remain subject to \u201cpenny stock\u201d regulations and as a consequence there are additional sales practice requirements and additional warnings issued by the SEC.\nIf at any time we have net tangible assets of $5,000,000 or less and the trading price of our common stock is below $5.00 per share, the open-market trading of our common stock will be subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules of the SEC. The \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally those with assets in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 together with their spouse). For transactions covered by these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of securities and have received the purchaser\u2019s written consent to the transaction before the purchase. Additionally, for any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the broker-dealer must deliver, before the transaction, a disclosure schedule prescribed by the SEC relating to the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information on the limited market in penny stocks. These additional burdens imposed on broker-dealers may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell the common stock and may affect a stockholder\u2019s ability to resell the common stock.\nThere can be no assurance that our common stock will qualify for exemption from the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules. In any event, even if our common stock is exempt from such rules, we would remain subject to Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act, which gives the SEC the authority to restrict any person from participating in a distribution of a \u201cpenny stock\u201d if the SEC finds that such a restriction would be in the public interest.\nStockholders should be aware that, according to SEC Release No. 34-29093, the market for penny stocks has suffered in recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse. Such patterns include (i) control of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer; (ii) manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases; (iii) boiler room practices involving high-pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced sales persons; (iv) excessive and undisclosed bid-ask differential and markups by selling broker-dealers; and (v) the wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level, along with the resulting inevitable collapse of those prices and with consequent investor losses. Our management is aware of the abuses that have occurred historically in the penny stock market.\nWe are responsible for the indemnification of our officers and directors under certain circumstances which could result in substantial expenditures, which we may be unable to recoup.\nOur bylaws provide for the indemnification of our directors, officers, employees, and agents, under certain circumstances, against attorney\u2019s fees and other expenses incurred by them in any litigation to which they become a party arising from their association with or activities on behalf of us. This indemnification policy could result in substantial expenditures, which we may be unable to recoup.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which could affect our ability to ensure timely and reliable financial reports, affect the ability of our auditors to attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls should we become an accelerated filer in the future, and weaken investors\u2019 confidence in our financial reporting.\nAs directed by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the SEC adopted rules requiring public companies in their annual reports to include a report of management on the reporting company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. We became subject to this requirement commencing with our fiscal year ended December 31, 2007 and a report of our management is included under Item 9A. \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As set forth in such report, our management has concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of December 31, 2021, and there existed a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021.\nWe believe we are taking appropriate actions to remediate such material weakness; however, such measures may not be sufficient to address the material weaknesses identified or ensure that our controls and procedures are effective. We may also discover other material weaknesses in the future. Any failure to maintain or implement required new or improved controls, or any difficulties we encounter in the implementation of such controls, could cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our financial statements and affect the ability of our auditors to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financing reporting to the extent we become an accelerated filer in the future. In addition, substantial costs and resources may be required to rectify any internal control deficiencies. If we cannot produce reliable financial reports, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly, and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nThere is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur auditors have indicated in their report on our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 that conditions exist that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements. The Company incurred recurring losses from operations, has net current liabilities and an accumulated deficit that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.\nTo alleviate the conditions that raise substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern, management plans to enhance the sales model of advance payment, and further strengthen its collection of accounts receivable. Further, the Company is currently exploring strategic alternatives to accelerate the launch of nutrition products. In addition, management believes that the Company\u2019s existing fixed assets can serve as collateral to support additional bank loans. While the current plans will allow the Company to fund its operations in the next twelve months, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to achieve its future strategic alternatives raising substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.\nIf we are unable to generate enough cash or obtain additional sufficient funding, we would need to scale back or eliminate our business plan, reduce our operating costs and headcount, or discontinue or curtail our operations. Accordingly, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected, and we may be unable to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets and may receive less than the value at which those assets are carried on our audited consolidated financial statements, and it is likely that investors will lose all or a part of their investment. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock.\nYou should not rely on an investment in our common stock to provide dividend income, as we have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not plan to pay any in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of our common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any return on their investment.\nRestrictions on the Use of Rule 144 by Shell Companies or Former Shell Companies.\nHistorically, the SEC has taken the position that Rule 144 under the Securities Act, as amended, is not available for the resale of securities initially issued by companies that are, or previously were, blank check companies like us, to their promoters or affiliates despite technical compliance with the requirements of Rule 144. The SEC has codified and expanded this position in its amendments effective on February 15, 2008 and applies it to securities acquired both before and after that date by prohibiting the use of Rule 144 for resale of securities issued by shell companies (other than business transaction related shell companies) or issuers that have been at any time previously a shell company. The SEC has provided an important exception to this prohibition, however, if the following conditions are met: the issuer of the securities that was formerly a shell company has ceased to be a shell company; the issuer of the securities is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act; the issuer of the securities has filed all Exchange Act reports and material required to be filed, as applicable, during the preceding 12 months (or such shorter period that the issuer was required to file such reports and materials), other than Form 8-K reports; and at least one year has elapsed from the time that the issuer filed current Form 10 type information with the SEC reflecting its status as an entity that is not a shell company. As such, due to the fact that we had been a shell company prior to October 2005, holders of \u201crestricted securities\u201d within the meaning of Rule 144, when reselling their shares pursuant to Rule 144, shall be subject to the conditions set forth herein.", "PERMNO": 93016, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "CPHI"}
