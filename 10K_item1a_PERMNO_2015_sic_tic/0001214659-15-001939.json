{"cik": "919745", "company": "DARA BioSciences, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-03", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nAn investment in our common stock involves a number of very significant risks. You should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties in addition to other information in this report in evaluating our company and its business before purchasing shares of our company's common stock. Our business, operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed due to any of the following risks. You could lose all or part of your investment due to any of these risks.\nRisks Related to Our Company and Our Business\nWe expect to continue to incur losses and will need to raise additional capital to operate our business.\nWe have incurred losses since inception and expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. We estimate that we have sufficient working capital to continue our operations through the first quarter of 2016. If we incur unanticipated expenses, our capital resources may be expended more rapidly than we expect. We anticipate that significant additional financing will be required in the future to maintain and expand our business, and such financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all.\nIf we need funds and cannot raise them on acceptable terms, we may not be able to:\n\u25cf\ncontinue marketing and sales efforts with respect to our existing products, or begin commercialization of any other products;\n\u25cf\nsuccessfully build a portfolio of additional products for commercialization;\n\u25cf\nsuccessfully out-license, otherwise monetize or commercialize any of our programs; or\n\u25cf\ncontinue operations.\nWe intend to finance our business, in part, through the private placement and public offering of equity and debt securities as needed. We have historically financed our operations primarily from proceeds of registered direct offerings and private placements of equity securities and the sale of securities we acquired through investments made in other companies. When we raise additional equity capital, investors\u2019 interests in the Company will be diluted and investors may suffer dilution in their net book value per share depending on the price at which such securities are sold. If we issue any such additional equity securities, such issuances also will cause a reduction in the proportionate ownership and voting power of all other stockholders. Further, any such issuance may result in a change in control.\nOur limited experience selling and marketing pharmaceutical products may make it difficult to evaluate our business to date and our future viability.\nWe are in the early stage of our commercial operations and have only a limited operating history on which to base an evaluation of our current business and prospects. For example, we are in the early stages of building our sales and marketing strategy and organization and have only recently established a national sales team. We will also need to dedicate substantial time, effort and capital to develop KRN 5500 into a commercial product, subject to the results of clinical trials, which may not be positive, and FDA approval, which we may not receive. Our operations and development are subject to all of the risks inherent in the growth of an early stage company. We will be subject to the risks inherent in the ownership and operation of a company with a limited operating history such as regulatory setbacks and delays, fluctuations in expenses, competition, the general strength of regional and national economies and governmental regulation. Any failure to successfully address these risks and uncertainties could seriously harm our business and prospects. We may not succeed given the technological, marketing, strategic and competitive challenges we face. The likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the expenses, difficulties, complications, problems and delays frequently encountered in connection with the growth of a new business, the continuing development of new drug development technology and the competitive and regulatory environment in which we operate or may choose to operate in the future.\nOur business will be harmed if we do not successfully execute our business strategy.\nOur business strategy is to in-license products for commercialization, enter into collaborative agreements with drug manufacturers and out-license or sell our remaining clinical development asset. These measures are critical to successfully building our portfolio of oncological products for commercialization. We may not be able to secure needed licensing or other partnering arrangements, and any such arrangements, even if completed successfully, may not be on terms favorable to us, may not perform as expected, may result in unexpected liabilities and may never contribute significant revenues or cash flow. We depend to a significant extent on the expertise of and dedication of sufficient resources by our licensors, licensees and partners to develop and commercialize products. Each individual licensor, licensee or corporate partner will control the amount and timing of resources devoted by it to these activities. Moreover, the success of any such licenses or other alliances depends in part upon such partners\u2019 own marketing and strategic considerations, including the relative advantages of alternative marketing partners and strategies. Corporate partners may pursue alternative technologies or develop products that are competitive with our products. Disputes may arise between us and one or more of our collaborative partners regarding our collaborative arrangements. In such an event, we may be required to initiate or defend expensive litigation or arbitration proceedings or to seek and attempt to reach agreement with another collaborative partner. We may not be able to resolve successfully a dispute with a collaborative partner or to enter into a satisfactory arrangement with a replacement collaborative partner. If we are not successful in executing our business strategy we will not achieve the revenues we anticipate and our business will be materially harmed.\nOur ability to generate revenues or profits from our products will be dependent upon successful operation of the dedicated sales force that is being contractually provided to us by a third party. Any challenges that may arise in connection with the ongoing operations of the dedicated sales force, or any failure of our marketing strategy to achieve the desired results, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results and stock price.\nIn October, 2013, we entered into an agreement with Alamo for a twenty (20) person national sales team in the U.S. oncology market. Pursuant to the agreement and a shared sales force agreement with Mission (Alamo\u2019s parent company), since January 2014 the Alamo sales team has promoted our Soltamox\u00ae (tamoxifen citrate) and Gelclair\u00ae products, as well as Mission\u2019s Ferralet\u00ae 90 (for anemia) and Aquoral\u00ae (for cancer related dry mouth). Mission\u2019s products are concurrently being promoted by Mission in other non-oncology related therapeutic markets and all are under patent protection throughout the term of our agreement. The agreements with Alamo and Mission expand DARA's presence in oncology supportive care to address ongoing areas of unmet medical need.\nOur ability to successfully market our product portfolio, and to generate revenues or profits from our products, will depend upon successful operation of the shared sales force that Alamo is providing to us under contract. There can be no assurances that the sales representatives will achieve the desired results or that they will be successful in marketing our products. Pursuant to the contractual arrangements governing the sales force, we will be responsible for significant financial obligations whether or not the sales force achieves the desired results, including fixed monthly fees subject to an annual escalator, reimbursement for certain expenses, implementation fees, and recruiting fees in connection with new hires for the sales force. If the sales force does not effectively market our products as desired, our financial condition, results of operations and stock price could be materially adversely affected.\nThe success of our current products and any future products we may commercialize will depend on the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, healthcare payers and others in the medical community.\nAny products that we bring to the market may not gain market acceptance by physicians, patients, healthcare payers and others in the medical community. If these products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we will not generate material product revenues and we will not become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf\nthe prevalence and severity of any side effects;\n\u25cf\nthe efficacy and potential advantages of alternative treatments;\n\u25cf\nthe prices of our product candidates;\n\u25cf\nthe willingness of physicians to prescribe our products; and\n\u25cf\nsufficient coverage or reimbursement by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d) and third party payers.\nCommercialization of a new product or a new method of use for an existing product involves risks of failure inherent in the development of products based on innovative technologies and the risks associated with drug development generally.\nCommercialization of a new or newly launched product, including Soltamox and Gelclair, or a new method of use for an existing product involves risks of failure inherent in the development of products based on innovative technologies and the risks associated with drug development generally. These risks include the following:\n\u25cf\nthe products, even if safe and effective, may be difficult to manufacture on a large scale or uneconomical to market;\n\u25cf\nproprietary rights of third parties may prevent us from exploiting technologies or marketing products; and\n\u25cf\nthird parties, who may have larger sales and marketing capacities, may offer equivalent or superior products.\nOur ability to commercialize our products will depend on, among other things, our ability to:\n\u25cf\ncomplete any necessary clinical trials and studies with respect to any partnered clinical assets;\n\u25cf\nobtain and maintain necessary intellectual property rights to our products;\n\u25cf\nobtain and maintain necessary regulatory approvals related to the efficacy and safety of our products;\n\u25cf\nenter into arrangements with manufacturers to provide manufacturing resources; and\n\u25cf\nestablish marketing and sales channels.\nIf we do not successfully execute some or all of these initiatives, our commercialization efforts may not succeed and our business will be materially harmed.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will be able to effectively market our existing products and product candidates.\nA significant part of our success depends on the various marketing strategies we plan to implement. Our business model was historically focused solely on product development, and until our launch of Soltamox in late 2012, we had never attempted to commercialize any product. We are in the early stages of building our sales and marketing strategy and organization, and only established a national sales team in January 2014 through our contractual relationships with Mission and Alamo. There can be no assurance as to the success of any such marketing strategy or that we will be able to build a successful sales and marketing organization. If we cannot effectively market those products we seek to commercialize directly, such products\u2019 prospects will be harmed.\nWe are substantially depndent on a relatively small group of products.\nSales of a limited number of our products collectively represent a significant portion of our revenues and we expect this concentration will continue in the foreseeable future. If the volume or pricing of our largest selling products declines in the future or we are unable to satisfy market demand for these products, our business, financial position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to continue to commercialize additional products in a timely and cost-effective manner, we may not achieve our expected revenue growth or profitability or such revenue growth and profitability, if any, could be delayed.\nOur future success will depend to a substantial degree on our ability to continue to commercialize new products in a timely and cost-effective manner. The acquisition, development and commercialization of new products is complex, time-consuming and costly and involves a high degree of business risk. We may, however, encounter unexpected delays in the launch of any such products, or these products, if fully commercialized by us, may not perform as we expect.\nThe success of our new product offerings will depend upon several factors, including our ability to properly anticipate customer needs, obtain timely regulatory approvals and locate and establish collaborations for product development and finished product manufacturing in a cost-effective manner. In addition, the acquisition, development and commercialization of new products require significant up-front costs, including costs associated with product development, obtaining regulatory approval, building inventory and sales and marketing. Furthermore, the development and commercialization of new products is subject to inherent risks, including the possibility that any new product may:\n\u25cf\nfail to receive or encounter unexpected delays in obtaining necessary regulatory approvals;\n\u25cf\nbe difficult or impossible to manufacture on a larger scale;\n\u25cf\nbe uneconomical to market;\n\u25cf\nfail to be developed prior to the successful marketing of similar or superior products by third parties; and\n\u25cf\ninfringe on the proprietary rights of third parties.\nWe may not achieve our expected revenue growth or profitability or such revenue growth and profitability, if any, could be delayed if we are not successful in continuing to develop and commercialize new products.\nWe rely on third parties for the manufacture of our products, and if such parties fail to supply us with finished products in the quantities we require on a timely basis, sales of our products could be delayed or prevented, our revenues could decline and we may not achieve profitability.\nWe do not, nor do we intend to, manufacture any products ourselves. Instead, we rely on third parties to manufacture the products we seek to commercialize. If the third parties we contract with do not provide these services to us in a satisfactory manner, we may not be able to obtain these services from others in a timely manner or on commercially acceptable terms. Likewise, if we encounter delays or difficulties with our manufacturing partners in producing our products, the distribution, marketing and subsequent sales of these products could be adversely affected. If, for any reason, our third party manufacturers are unable to obtain or deliver sufficient quantities of finished products on a timely basis or we develop any significant disagreements with such parties, the manufacture or supply of our products could be disrupted, which may decrease our sales revenue, increase our operating expenses or otherwise negatively impact our operations. In addition, if we are unable to engage and retain third parties for the supply of finished products on commercially acceptable terms, we may not be able to sell our products as planned.\nWe work with our third party manufacturing parties to maintain the supply of our products and have engaged them in discussions to develop backup supply plans. However, the manufacture of pharmaceutical products is highly exacting and complex and our manufacturing partners may experience problems during the manufacture of finished products for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, manufacturing quality concerns, problems with raw materials, natural disaster related events or other environmental factors. If problems arise during the production, storage or distribution of a batch of product, that batch of product may have to be discarded. If we are unable to find alternative sources of finished products, this could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost sales and damage to customer relations. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to market, voluntary recalls, corrective actions or product liability related costs may also be incurred. Problems with respect to the manufacture, storage or distribution of our products could materially disrupt our business and reduce our revenues and prevent or delay us from achieving profitability.\nAny loss of our license rights to use certain critical intellectual property from Rosemont, Helsinn or other licensors for any reason would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nSoltamox is an FDA-approved liquid formulation of tamoxifen, which is primarily used to treat breast cancer. We exclusively license and distribute Soltamox in the United States. If we breach or fail to perform the material conditions of, including the minimum sales requirement, or fail to extend the term of the agreements under which we license critical intellectual property from Rosemont or other licensors, we may lose all or some of our rights to such intellectual property, and such loss would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nGelclair is an FDA-cleared product indicated for the management and relief of pain due to oral mucositis. We are party to an exclusive license and distribution agreement with Helsinn, a Switzerland based company, for rights to market Gelclair in the United States. If we breach or fail to perform the material conditions of the agreement, including the launch and minimum sales requirements, we may lose all or some of our rights to such intellectual property, and such loss could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur clinical development asset, KRN5500, is in an early stage of development, and we may not be able to successfully partner it.\nThe drug development process is highly uncertain and requires a substantial investment of capital. KRN5500 is in the early stages of development and has not been approved for commercial sale. We do not presently have the capital resources to fully develop KRN 550 into a commercial product. We are attempting to partner the drug with an established oncology development company to undertake and support the cost of a Phase 2b program to test for safety and efficacy. Before a drug product is approved by the FDA for commercial marketing, it must be tested for safety and effectiveness in clinical trials that are expensive to conduct and can take many years to complete. Promising results in preclinical development or early clinical trials may not be predictive of results obtained in later clinical trials. Pharmaceutical companies may experience significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after obtaining promising results in earlier preclinical and clinical trials. At any time, new safety information may lead the FDA to place a clinical trial on clinical hold, or permanently stop the trial. We or our collaborators may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, the clinical development process that could delay or prevent our drug candidate from being successfully commercialized, including:\n\u25cf\nfailure to achieve clinical trial results that indicate a product candidate is effective in treating a specified condition or illness in humans;\n\u25cf\nsafety issues, including the presence of harmful side effects;\n\u25cf\ndetermination by the FDA that the submitted data do not satisfy the criteria for approval;\n\u25cf\nnew information that suggests lack of commercial viability of the drug;\n\u25cf\nfailure to acquire, on reasonable terms, intellectual property rights necessary for commercialization; and\n\u25cf\ndevelopment of competing therapeutics that are more effective.\nOur success depends on our ability to retain our managerial personnel and to attract additional personnel (including a sales force).\nOur success depends largely on our ability to attract and retain managerial personnel, and to have a fully staffed sales force pursuant to our contractual arrangements with Alamo. We operate with a small staff and a 20-person contracted sales force. Competition for desirable personnel is intense, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain the necessary staff. The loss of one or more members of our managerial or commercial staff, or any administrative difficulties associated with the implementation of our sales force through Alamo or difficulties in keeping the sales force fully staffed, could have a material adverse effect on our future operations and on the successful development of products for our target markets. The failure to maintain management, particularly our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Medical Officer, and to attract additional key sales and other personnel could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe success of our business depends on our ability to develop and protect our intellectual property rights, which could be expensive.\nOur success will depend in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain protection in the United States and other countries for the intellectual property covering or incorporated into our technology and products. The patent situation in the field of pharmaceuticals is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and scientific questions. We may not be able to obtain additional issued patents relating to our technology or products. Even if issued, patents may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing similar products or limit the length or term of patent protection we may have for our products. Changes in either patent laws or in the interpretations of patent laws in the United States or other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection, and any defense of our patent rights would be costly and time-consuming and may adversely affect our overall financial condition and liquidity.\nOur patents also may not afford us protection against numerous competitors with similar technology. Patent applications in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing and in some cases not at all. Therefore, because publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, neither we nor our licensors can be certain that we or they were the first to develop the inventions claimed in issued patents or pending patent applications, or that we or they were the first to file for protection of the inventions set forth in these patent applications. Even in the event that our patents are upheld as valid and enforceable, they may not foreclose potential competitors from developing new technologies or \u201cworkarounds\u201d that circumvent our patent rights. This means that our patent portfolio may not prevent the entry of a competitive product into the market. In addition, patents generally expire, regardless of their date of issue, 20 years from the earliest claimed non-provisional filing date. As a result, the time required to obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate may consume part or all of the patent term. We are not able to accurately predict the remaining length of the applicable patent term following regulatory approval of any of our product candidates.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know-how, the value of our technology and products could be adversely affected.\nIn addition to patented technology, we rely on trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and know-how to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive positions. We seek to protect this information in part through confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties. If any of these agreements are breached, we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. Moreover, there can be no assurance that third parties will not know, discover or develop independently equivalent proprietary information or techniques, that they will not gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our trade secrets to the public. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that we can maintain and protect unpatented proprietary information and trade secrets. Misappropriation of our intellectual property would have an adverse effect on our competitive position and may cause us to incur substantial litigation costs.\nWe may be subject to claims that we infringe the intellectual property rights of others, and unfavorable outcomes could harm our business.\nOur operations may be subject to claims, and potential litigation, arising from our alleged infringement of patents, trade secrets or copyrights owned by third parties. We intend to fully comply with the law in avoiding such infringements. However, within the drug development industry, established companies have actively pursued such infringements, and have initiated such claims and litigation, which has made the entry of competitive products more difficult. We may experience such claims or litigation initiated by existing, better-funded competitors. We could also become involved in disputes regarding the ownership of intellectual property rights that relate to our technologies. These disputes could arise out of collaboration relationships, strategic partnerships or other relationships. Any such litigation could be expensive, take significant time, and could divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns. Our failure to prevail in any such legal proceedings, or even the mere occurrence of such legal proceedings, could substantially affect our ability to meet our expenses and continue operations.\nIn November 2012, a suit was filed in the United States District Court District of Columbia naming our Company as a defendant. Plaintiff in the suit is GlycoBioSciences, Inc. Also named as defendant is Innocutis Holdings, LLC, with which entity we have an Exclusive Marketing Agreement granting us rights to promote Bionect in the U.S. oncology and radiation oncology marketplace. Plaintiff alleges that defendants\u2019 distribution and sale of Bionect infringes on certain of plaintiff\u2019s patents and plaintiff seeks to enjoin defendants\u2019 alleged patent infringement and seeks unspecified damages and costs. Pursuant to the Exclusive Marketing Agreement, Innocutis is required to indemnify us in connection with this lawsuit, an obligation which survives the expiration or termination of the Exclusive Marketing Agreement. As a result, Innocutis has assumed our defense. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on February 1, 2013. On June 26, 2014, counsel for the defendants notified the Court that the United States Patent and Trademark Office had completed a reexamination of two patents which underlie the suit and also filed a Motion to Dismiss. On August 25, 2014, plaintiff filed an amended complaint asserting that defendants infringed on certain patents relating to the sale of Bionect. On September 25, 2014, defendants filed an answer and asserted various affirmative defenses and counterclaims. A scheduling conference which was previously scheduled to be held in December has been moved to March 3, 2015. No assurance can be given regarding the outcome of this litigation or its effect on our financial position or results of operations.\nIn July, 2014, a suit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia naming us as a defendant. The plaintiff in the suit is GlycoBioSciences Inc. Also named as a defendant is Helsinn. The plaintiff alleges that defendants\u2019 distribution and sale of Gelclair infringes on one of plaintiff\u2019s patents and plaintiff seeks to enjoin defendants\u2019 alleged patent infringement and seeks unspecified damages and costs. Pursuant to the Company\u2019s license agreement with Helsinn, Helsinn is required to indemnify us in connection with this lawsuit. As a result, Helsinn has assumed our defense. No assurance can be given regarding the outcome of this litigation or its effect on our financial position or results of operations.\nOur inability to manage our planned growth could harm our business.\nAs we work toward building a portfolio of oncology treatment and supportive care pharmaceutical products and a sales organization that will market such products for sale we expect to require additional personnel. As a result, our operating expenses and capital requirements may increase significantly. Our ability to manage our growth effectively requires us to forecast accurately our sales and growth and manufacturing needs and to expend funds to improve our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures. If we are unable to manage our anticipated growth effectively, our business could be harmed.\nRisks Relating to the Pharmaceutical Business\nThe pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive and we may be unable to successfully compete against competitors with substantially more resources than we have.\nIn general, the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive. The technological areas in which we work continue to evolve at a rapid pace. Competition from pharmaceutical, chemical and biotechnology companies, universities and research institutions is intense and we expect it to increase. Many of these competitors are substantially larger than we are and have substantially greater capital resources, research and development capabilities and experience, manufacturing, marketing, financial and managerial resources than we do. Acquisitions of competing companies by large pharmaceutical companies or other companies could enhance the financial, marketing and other resources available to these competitors.\nAn important factor in our ability to compete will be the timing of market introduction of competitive products. Accordingly, the relative speed with which we and competing companies can in-license and develop products, complete the clinical testing and approval processes, and supply commercial quantities of the products to the market will be an important element of market success. Other significant competitive factors include:\n\u25cf\nproduct safety and efficacy;\n\u25cf\ntiming and scope of regulatory approval;\n\u25cf\nproduct availability;\n\u25cf\nmarketing and sales capabilities;\n\u25cf\nreimbursement coverage from insurance companies and others;\n\u25cf\nthe extent of clinical benefits and side effects of our products relative to their cost;\n\u25cf\nprice;\n\u25cf\npatent protection; and\n\u25cf\ncapabilities of partners with whom we may collaborate.\nThere can be no assurance that we can develop products that are more effective or achieve greater market acceptance than competitive products, or that our competitors will not succeed in developing products and technologies that are more effective than ours or that render our products and technologies less competitive or obsolete.\nIf the healthcare system or reimbursement policies change, the prices of our potential products may be lower than expected and our potential sales may decline.\nThe levels of revenues and profitability of bio-pharmaceutical companies like ours may be affected by the continuing efforts of government and third party payers to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare through various means. For example, in the U.S. there have been, and we expect that there will continue to be, a number of federal and state proposals to implement similar governmental control. While we cannot predict whether any legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted, the adoption of such proposals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and profitability. In addition, in the U.S. and elsewhere, sales of therapeutic and other pharmaceutical products depend in part on the availability of reimbursement to the consumer from third party payers, such as government and private insurance plans. Third party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Moreover, in certain foreign markets, pricing or profitability of therapeutic and other pharmaceutical products is subject to governmental control. We cannot assure you that any of our potential products will be considered cost effective or that reimbursement to the consumer will be available or will be sufficient to allow us to sell our potential products on a competitive and profitable basis.\nGovernment regulation of our business is extensive and drug approvals are uncertain, expensive and time-consuming.\nThe research, development, pre-clinical and clinical trials of any intended products, including ones we may seek to partner with licensees or collaborators, are subject to an extensive regulatory approval process by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the U.S. and abroad, such as in the European Union and Japan. The process of obtaining FDA and other required regulatory approvals for drug and biological products, including required pre-clinical and clinical testing, is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. Even if regulatory clearance is obtained, a marketed product is subject to continual review, and later discovery of previously unknown adverse events or failure to comply with the applicable manufacturing, packaging, distribution and marketing requirements may result in restrictions on a product\u2019s marketing or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible criminal sanctions.\nCurrently we have only one clinical development candidate, KRN 5500, which we are looking to partner with an established oncology development company to undertake and support the cost for the Phase 2b program. A delay or setback in the partnering efforts with respect to KRN5500 would have a material adverse effect on our ability to realize any benefits from the drug candidate.\nOur business, as well as that of our manufacturers, is strictly regulated by the federal and other governments, and there can be no assurance that either we or our manufacturers will be able to maintain full compliance with all applicable regulations.\nThe clinical testing, manufacture and sale of pharmaceutical products and medical devices, including ones we currently or may in the future sell independently or through partnerships with licensees or collaborators, are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the U.S., principally the FDA, and corresponding foreign regulatory agencies. Changes in existing regulations or adoption of new regulations or policies could prevent us from obtaining, or affect the timing of, future regulatory approvals or clearances. We cannot assure you that we or our development partners will be able to obtain necessary regulatory clearances or approvals on a timely basis, or at all, or that we will not be required to incur significant costs in obtaining or maintaining such regulatory approvals. Delays in receipt of, or failure to receive, such approvals or clearances, the loss of previously obtained approvals or clearances or the failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny enforcement action by regulatory authorities with respect to past or future regulatory noncompliance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, refusal to authorize the marketing of new products and criminal prosecution.\nOur products that are approved for market are still subject to continuing regulation. Any proposed products that may in the future be approved for market will also be subject to continued regulation. We and our collaborative partners, including our manufacturers, will continuously be subject to routine inspection by the FDA and will have to comply with the host of regulatory requirements that usually apply to pharmaceutical products marketed in the U.S., including labeling regulations, the FDA\u2019s Good Manufacturing Practice requirements, Good Clinical Practices and Good Laboratory Practices, review and response to adverse drug experience reports and regulation governing marketing and promotion of approved drug products. Our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action or sanctions by the FDA, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approval of our products, delay, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, product seizures or recalls, operational restrictions or criminal prosecutions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business exposes us to potential liability for personal injury and product liability claims that could affect our financial condition.\nOur business involves the testing of new drugs on human volunteers and the use of our marketed products by patients. This exposes us to the risk of liability for personal injury or death to patients resulting from, among other things, possible unforeseen adverse side effects or improper administration of a drug. Many study volunteers and participants are already seriously ill and are at risk of further illness or death. If we are required to pay damages or incur defense costs in connection with any personal injury claim that is outside the scope of indemnification agreements we have with clients and collaborative partners, if any indemnification agreement is not performed in accordance with its terms or if our liability exceeds the amount of any applicable indemnification limits or available insurance coverage, we could be materially and adversely affected both financially and reputationally. Any such claims may also prevent us from being able to obtain adequate insurance for these risks at reasonable rates in the future.\nIf we or our contract sales force market our products in a manner that violates healthcare fraud and abuse laws, or if we violate false claims laws or fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid rebate program or other governmental pricing programs, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties or additional reimbursement requirements and sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nIn addition to FDA restrictions on the marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal healthcare fraud and abuse laws have been applied in recent years to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws include anti-kickback statutes and false claims statutes. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the safe harbors, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of these laws.\nThe federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare program. Although there are several statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending such healthcare items or services may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor.\nFederal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement in order to have a claim paid. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for a variety of alleged promotional and marketing activities, such as providing free trips, free goods, sham consulting fees and grants and other monetary benefits to prescribers, reporting inflated average wholesale prices to pricing services that were then used by federal programs to set reimbursement rates and engaging in off-label promotion that caused claims to be submitted to Medicaid for non-covered, off-label uses. Such activities have been alleged to cause the resulting claims for reimbursement to be \u201cfalse\u201d claims. Most states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer.\nWe have initiated our participation in the federal Medicaid Rebate Program established by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, as well as several state supplemental rebate programs, in connection with the sale of Soltamox and would anticipate participating in these programs with respect to any future products we may commercialize. Though to date invoices for rebates have not been material, under the Medicaid rebate program, we anticipate paying a rebate to each state Medicaid program for our products that are reimbursed by those programs. Federal law requires that any company that participates in the Medicaid rebate program extend comparable discounts to qualified purchasers under the Public Health Service Act pharmaceutical pricing program, which requires us to sell our products to certain customers at prices lower than we otherwise might be able to charge. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule, additional pricing laws and requirements apply. Pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under federal and state false claims laws in connection with allegedly inaccurate information submitted to the Medicaid Rebate Program or for knowingly submitting or using allegedly inaccurate pricing information in connection with federal pricing and discount programs.\nPricing and rebate calculations vary among products and programs. The calculations are complex and may be subject to interpretation by us or our contractors, governmental or regulatory agencies and the courts. Our methodologies for calculating these prices could be challenged under false claims laws or other laws. We or our contractors could make a mistake in calculating reported prices and required discounts, revisions to those prices and discounts, or determining whether a revision is necessary, which could result in retroactive rebates (and interest, if any). Governmental agencies may also make changes in program interpretations, requirements or conditions of participation, some of which may have implications for amounts previously estimated or paid. If this were to occur, we could face, in addition to prosecution under federal and state false claims laws, substantial liability and civil monetary penalties, exclusion of our products from reimbursement under government programs, criminal fines or imprisonment or the entry into a Corporate Integrity Agreement, Deferred Prosecution Agreement, or similar arrangement.\nIn addition, federal legislation now imposes additional requirements. For example, as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, a federal physician payment disclosure provision based on the Physician Payments Sunshine Act was enacted, which requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to report certain gifts and payments to physicians beginning in 2013. These reports will then be placed on a public database. Failure to so report could subject companies to significant financial penalties.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations could be costly. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations, including activities conducted by our sales team in the promotion of our licensed or co-promoted products, are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nIf we issue additional shares in the future, it will result in the dilution of our existing shareholders.\nOur articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of up to (i) 75,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.01 per share, of which 19,755,595 were issued and outstanding at December 31, 2014, and (ii) 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, of which 468 shares of Series A preferred stock, 50 shares of Series B-2 preferred stock and 117 shares of Series C-1 preferred stock were issued and outstanding at December 31, 2014. Our Board of Directors may choose to issue some or all of the remaining authorized shares to acquire one or more products and to fund our overhead and general operating requirements. The issuance of any such shares may reduce the book value per share and may contribute to a reduction in the market price of the outstanding shares of our common stock. If we issue any such additional shares, such issuance will reduce the proportionate ownership and voting power of all current shareholders. Further, such issuance may result in a change of control of our corporation.\nOur stock price could be volatile and our trading volume may fluctuate substantially.\nThe price of our common stock has been and may in the future continue to be extremely volatile. Many factors could have a significant impact on the future price of our common stock, including:\n\u25cf\nour inability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, whether through the issuance of equity securities or debt;\n\u25cf\nour failure to successfully commercialize products we license for commercial sale;\n\u25cf\nour failure to successfully advance the development of our programs or otherwise implement our business objectives;\n\u25cf\nchanges in our intellectual property portfolio or developments or disputes concerning the proprietary rights of our product candidates;\n\u25cf\nour ability to successfully enter into and maintain manufacturing relationships for our products;\n\u25cf\nprogress or future results of partnered assets;\n\u25cf\nprogress of regulatory approval of our partnered products and compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf\nmarket acceptance of our products;\n\u25cf\ntechnological innovations, new commercial products and clinical activities by us, our partners or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nchanges in government regulations;\n\u25cf\nissuance of new or changed securities analysts\u2019 reports or recommendations;\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic conditions and other external factors;\n\u25cf\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial and operating results;\n\u25cf\nthe degree of trading liquidity in our common stock; and\n\u25cf\nour ability to regain compliance with the minimum bid price (and our ability to maintain compliance with other minimum standards) required for remaining listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market.\nA significant number of shares of our common stock are issuable pursuant to outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock, options and warrants, and we expect to sell additional shares of our common stock in the future. Sales of these shares will dilute the interests of other security holders and may depress the price of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had 19,755,595 shares of common stock outstanding. As of December 31, 2014, there were 37,440 shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of outstanding shares of Series A preferred stock, 20,408 shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of outstanding shares of Series B-2 preferred stock, 105,405 shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of outstanding shares of Series C-1 preferred stock, 17,505,025 shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding warrants with a weighted average exercise price of $2.52 per share, 1,142,101 shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding options with a weighted average exercise price of $3.96 per share, 445,577 shares of common stock reserved for future grants and awards under our equity incentive plans and 178,330 shares of common stock reserved for issuance to former Oncogenerix, Inc. stockholders, based upon our achievement of certain revenue or market capitalization milestones during the five year period ending January 2017. The conversion price of the Series B-2 preferred stock is subject to full-ratchet antidilution protection if we sell any common stock at a price lower than the then-conversion price of the Series B-2 (currently, $2.45 per share). Similarly, the conversion price of the Series C-1 preferred stock is subject to full-ratchet anti-dilution protection if we sell any common stock at a price lower than the then-conversion price of the Series C-1 (currently, $1.11 per share).\nIn addition to the foregoing, we may issue additional common stock, or other securities convertible into common stock, from time to time to finance our operations. We may also issue additional shares in connection with additional stock options or restricted stock granted to our employees, officers, directors and consultants under our equity compensation plans. The issuance of the shares of common stock underlying these instruments, or perception that issuance may occur, will have a dilutive impact on other stockholders and could have a material negative effect on the market price of our common stock.\nIf we fail to satisfy applicable listing standards, including maintenance of at least $2.5 million of stockholders\u2019 equity and regaining compliance with the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement, our common stock may be delisted from The NASDAQ Capital Market.\nAs previously disclosed, on November 17, 2014, we received a notification letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of The NASDAQ Stock Market indicating that we were not in compliance with the $1.00 minimum bid requirement. In accordance with Marketplace Rule 5550(a)(2), we have 180 calendar days, or until May 18, 2015, to regain compliance with the minimum $1.00 price per share requirement. To regain compliance, any time before May 18, 2015, the bid price of our common stock must close at or above $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days. On May 18, 2015, if we meet The NASDAQ Capital Market initial listing criteria set forth in NASDAQ Listing Rule 5505, except for the minimum bid price requirement, we may be provided with an additional 180 calendar day compliance period to demonstrate compliance. If we are not eligible for an additional compliance period at that time, NASDAQ will provide us with written notification that our common stock will be delisted. Upon such notice, we may appeal the NASDAQ Staff\u2019s determination to a NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Panel pursuant to the procedures set forth in the applicable NASDAQ Marketplace Rules. There can be no assurance that, if we appeal any such determination of the NASDAQ Staff, such appeal would be successful.\nThere can be no assurances that we will regain compliance with NASDAQ\u2019s minimum bid requirement or, even if we do regain compliance, that we will be able to maintain our NASDAQ listing. If our common stock were delisted from NASDAQ, among other things, it would likely lead to a number of negative implications, including an adverse effect on the price of our common stock, reduced liquidity in our common stock, the loss of federal preemption of state securities laws and greater difficulty in obtaining financing. In the event of a de-listing, we would take actions to restore our compliance with NASDAQ\u2019s listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our common stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock from dropping below the NASDAQ minimum bid price requirement or prevent future non-compliance with NASDAQ\u2019s listing requirements.\nWe have never paid cash dividends and do not intend to do so.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We currently plan to retain any earnings to finance the growth of our business rather than to pay cash dividends. Payments of any cash dividends in the future will depend on our financial condition, results of operations and capital requirements, as well as other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors.", "PERMNO": 80452, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "DARA"}
