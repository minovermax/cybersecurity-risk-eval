You should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before purchasing our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently deem to be material and that we believe are specific to our company and our industry. In addition to these risks, our business may be subject to risks currently unknown to us. If any of these or other risks actually occurs, our business may be adversely affected, the trading price of our common stock may decline and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Associated with our Business and/or Industry\nA substantial amount of our revenue is derived from the U.S. Government, United Technologies Corporation, Airbus Defense & Space, and Finmeccanica SpA. A termination or reduction in the volume of business with any of these customers would have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profits.\nApproximately 19%, 16%, 16%, and 12% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2015 were to the U.S. Government (direct), United Technologies Corporation, Airbus Defense & Space, and Finmeccanica SpA. Other than sales to Finmeccanica SpA, these sales are made principally for the benefit of the military services of the U.S. Department of Defense and defense organizations of other countries and are affected by, among other things, budget authorization and appropriation processes. In the event that defense expenditures are reduced for products we manufacture or services we provide and are not offset by revenues from additional foreign sales, new programs, or products or services that we currently manufacture or provide, we may experience a reduction in our revenues and earnings and a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, there can be no assurance that our significant customers will continue to buy our products and services at current or increased levels. Specifically, United Technologies Corporation\u2019s acquisition of Goodrich Corporation in 2012, which has a hoist & winch business unit, could negatively impact our sales to United Technology Corporation.\nWe depend heavily on government contracts that may not be fully funded or may be terminated, and the failure to receive funding or the termination of one or more of these contracts could reduce our sales and increase our costs.\nSales to the U.S. Government and its prime contractors and subcontractors represent a significant portion of our business. In fiscal 2015, sales under U.S. Government contracts represented approximately 49% of our total sales, while sales to foreign governments represented approximately 25% of our total sales. We expect that the percentage of our revenues from government contracts will continue to be substantial in the future. Government programs can be structured into a series of individual contracts. The funding of these programs is generally subject to governmental appropriations and governmental and defense priorities are subject to change. In addition, Congress may reduce expenditures for defense programs or terminate such programs at any time. A decline in government expenditures or redirection of government funding may result in a reduction in the volume of contracts awarded to us. We have resources applied to specific government contracts and if any of those contracts were terminated, we may incur substantial costs redeploying those resources.\nAs a U.S. Government contractor, we are subject to a number of procurement rules and regulations and any non-compliance could subject us to fines, penalties, suspension or debarment.\nWe must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the award, administration, and performance of U.S. Government contracts. Government contract laws and regulations affect how we conduct business with our customers and, in some instances, impose added costs on our business. A violation of specific laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, contract termination, suspension, or debarment from bidding on future contracts. These fines and penalties could be imposed for failing to follow procurement integrity and bidding rules, employing improper billing practices or otherwise failing to follow cost accounting standards, receiving or paying kickbacks, or filing false claims. We have been, and expect to continue to be, subjected to audits by government agencies. The failure to comply with the terms of government contracts could harm our business reputation and could also result in progress payments being withheld.\nOur business could be adversely affected by a negative audit by the U.S. Government.\nAs a U.S. Government contractor, we are subject to routine audits by U.S. Government agencies, such as the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA). These agencies review a contractor\u2019s performance under its contracts, cost structure, and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards. The DCAA also reviews the adequacy of a contractor\u2019s compliance with its internal control systems and policies, including the contractor\u2019s purchasing, property, estimating, compensation, and management information systems. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed or must be refunded if already reimbursed. If an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties as well as administrative sanctions, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and\n($ in Thousands Except Share Amounts)\nsuspension or prohibition from doing business with the U.S. Government. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us.\nThe U.S. Government has the right to terminate or not renew any contract with us at any time and without notice. Any such action would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn some instances, laws and regulations impose terms or rights that are more favorable to the government than those typically available to commercial parties in negotiated transactions. For example, the U.S. Government may terminate any government contract and, in general, subcontracts, at its convenience as well as for default based on performance. Upon termination for convenience of a fixed-price type contract, we normally are entitled to receive the purchase price for delivered items, reimbursement for allowable costs for work-in-process, and an allowance for profit on the contract or adjustment for loss if contract completion would have resulted in a loss. Upon termination for convenience of a cost-reimbursement contract, we normally are entitled to reimbursement of allowable costs plus a portion of the fee. Such allowable costs would normally include the cost to terminate agreements with our suppliers and subcontractors. The amount of the fee recovered, if any, is related to the portion of the work accomplished prior to termination and is determined by negotiation.\nA termination arising from default could expose us to liability and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders. In addition, on those contracts for which we are teamed with others and are not the prime contractor, the U.S. Government could terminate a prime contract under which we are a subcontractor, irrespective of the quality of our services as a subcontractor.\nIn addition, our U.S. Government contracts typically span one or more base years and multiple option years. The U.S. Government generally has the right to not exercise option periods and may not exercise an option period if the U.S. Government is not satisfied with our performance on the contract.\nThe aircraft manufacturing industry is heavily regulated, and if we fail to comply with applicable requirements, our results of operations could suffer.\nGovernmental agencies throughout the world, including the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, or the FAA, prescribe standards and qualification requirements for aircraft components, including virtually all aviation products. Specific regulations vary from country to country, although compliance with FAA requirements generally satisfies regulatory requirements in other countries. We include, with some of the products we sell to our aircraft manufacturing customers, documentation certifying that each part complies with applicable regulatory requirements and meets applicable standards of airworthiness established by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries. In order to sell our products, we and the products we manufacture must also be certified by our individual OEM customers. If any of the material authorizations or approvals qualifying us to supply our products is revoked or suspended, then the sale of the subject product would be prohibited by law, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, the FAA or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries propose new regulations or changes to existing regulations, which are usually more stringent than existing regulations. If these proposed regulations are adopted and enacted, we may incur significant additional costs to achieve compliance, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nCancellations, reductions, or delays in customer orders, contracts and anticipated contracts may adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur overall operating results are affected by many factors, including the timing of orders from large customers and the timing of expenditures to manufacture parts and purchase inventory in anticipation of future sales of products and services. A large portion of our operating expenses are relatively fixed. Cancellations, reductions, or delays in customer orders, contracts and anticipated contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may be required to recognize a loss contract at a future date if certain events that we currently estimate are likely to occur do not, in fact, occur.\nAs more fully discussed under \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and \u201cCritical Accounting Policies\u201d and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, the earnings or losses recognized on individual contracts and the timing thereof are based on multiple estimates, including the probability of negotiating future contracts, revenues from existing contracts, costs and profitability. Although we update these estimates regularly, estimates are inherently uncertain, and our ultimate profitability on a contract may not be fully known until completion. We recognize estimated contract\n($ in Thousands Except Share Amounts)\nlosses when determined, regardless of where we are in the contract cycle, and adjust contract profit estimates based on ongoing contract profitability reviews. If the estimates noted above were to change significantly, requiring us to recognize unforeseen losses, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nDuring a period in which a contract loss is first recognized, or in a period when estimated contract profits become lower than previous estimates, income recorded on that contract in prior periods would be reversed. This could cause the profit or loss contribution from any given contract to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter.\nEngineering product development delays or customer engineering product development contract cancellations may adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur new product development requires up-front engineering research & development expenditures that impact current income and qualification units that are capitalized as intangible assets on the consolidated balance sheets if there is an existing contract or anticipated contract under a program. These engineering research & development expenditures may not result in future revenue-generating products or may not become technically viable as a result of pre-production qualification testing. These research & development expenditures are generally incurred as a part of awarded new product development for customers\u2019 aerospace platforms. If the product being designed does not meet customer technical specifications or timely delivery needs, we may need to write-off capitalized qualification units and reimburse customers for their costs that result from our product delivery delay.\nOur backlog is subject to reduction and cancellation at any time without notice, which could negatively impact our future revenues and results of operations.\nBacklog represents products or services that our customers have committed by contract to purchase from us. Backlog as of March 31, 2015 was $109,556. Backlog is subject to fluctuations and is not necessarily indicative of future sales. The U.S. Government may unilaterally modify or cancel its contracts with us. In addition, under certain of our commercial contracts, our customers may unilaterally modify or terminate their orders at any time for their convenience or do so if we fail to comply with our contractual obligations. Accordingly, certain portions of our backlog can be cancelled or reduced at the option of the U.S. Government and commercial customers. Our failure to replace cancelled or reduced backlog could negatively impact our revenues and results of operations.\nWe are subject to competition from entities which could have a substantial impact on our business.\nWe compete in some markets with entities that are larger and have substantially greater financial and technical resources than us. Generally, competitive factors include design capabilities, product performance, delivery, and price. Our ability to compete successfully in such markets will depend on our ability to develop and apply technological innovations and to expand our customer base and product lines. In addition, the development and application of technological innovations may mandate an expenditure of significant capital which may not be recovered through future sales of products or services. There can be no assurance that we will continue to successfully compete in any or all of the businesses discussed above. Our failure to compete successfully or to invest in technology where there is no recovery through product sales could have a materially adverse effect on our profitability. In addition, United Technologies Corporation\u2019s acquisition of Goodrich Corporation in 2012, which has a hoist & winch business unit, could negatively impact our sales to United Technology Corporation.\nWe are subject to liability under environmental laws.\nOur business and facilities are subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the use, manufacture, storage, handling, and disposal of hazardous materials and other waste products. Environmental laws generally impose liability for investigation, remediation, and removal of hazardous materials and other waste products on property owners and those who dispose of materials at waste sites whether or not the waste was disposed of legally at the time in question. We are currently addressing environmental remediation at certain former facilities, and we have been named as a potentially responsible party along with other organizations in a number of environmental clean-up sites and may be named in connection with future sites. We are required to contribute to the costs of the investigation and remediation and have taken reserves in our financial statements for future costs deemed probable and estimable for these costs. Although we have estimated and reserved for future environmental investigation and remediation costs, the final resolution of these liabilities may significantly vary from our estimates and could potentially have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. Our contingencies associated with environmental matters are described in Note 13 of \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d which is included elsewhere in this report.\n($ in Thousands Except Share Amounts)\nOur sales to foreign countries expose us to risks and adverse changes in local legal, tax, and regulatory schemes.\nIn fiscal 2015, 44% of our consolidated sales were to customers outside the United States. We expect international export sales to continue to contribute to our earnings for the foreseeable future. The export sales are subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside the United States. Such risks include, without limitation:\n\u00b7\nThe possibility of unfavorable circumstances arising from host country laws or regulations;\n\u00b7\nPotential negative consequences from changes to significant taxation policies, laws, or regulations;\n\u00b7\nChanges in tariff and trade barriers and import or export licensing requirements; and\n\u00b7\nPolitical or economic instability, insurrection, civil disturbance, or war.\nGovernment regulations could limit our ability to sell our products outside the United States and otherwise adversely affect our business.\nIn fiscal 2015, approximately 41% of our sales were subject to compliance with the United States control laws and regulations. Our failure to obtain the requisite licenses, meet registration standards or comply with other government export regulations would hinder our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products outside the United States. Compliance with these government regulations may also subject us to additional fees and operating costs. The potential absence of comparable restrictions on competitors in other countries could adversely affect our competitive position. In order to sell our products in European Union countries, we must satisfy certain technical requirements. If we are unable to comply with those requirements with respect to a significant quantity of our products, our sales in Europe would be restricted. Doing business internationally also subjects us to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including, without limitation, regulations relating to import-export control, technology transfer restrictions, foreign corrupt practices and anti-boycott provisions. Failure by us or our sales representatives or consultants to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities and could, in the extreme case, result in suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges, which would have a material adverse effect on us.\nWhile we believe our control systems are effective, there are inherent limitations in all control systems, and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nWe continue to take action to assure compliance with the internal controls, disclosure controls, and other requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, cannot guarantee that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all possible errors or all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no system of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Further, controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more persons, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected.\nThe terms of our credit agreement may restrict our current and future operating and financial flexibility.\nThe credit agreement that is in effect with respect to our debt includes covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to:\n\u00b7\nnot to spend or incur obligations to acquire fixed assets for more than $2,000 in any single fiscal year;\n\u00b7\ncreate, incur, assume or guarantee additional indebtedness, except in certain specified instances;\n\u00b7\ncreate, incur, assume or permit any liens on any asset, except in certain specified instances;\n\u00b7\nMerge, dissolve, liquidate, consolidate with or into another person or entity, or dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u00b7\nAcquire or purchase another business or its assets unless the business or assets are in a substantially similar line of business as our current business.\n($ in Thousands Except Share Amounts)\nOur credit agreement also contains covenants that require us to:\n\u00b7\nmaintain a tangible net worth equal to at least $22,500;\n\u00b7\nmaintain a ratio of funded debt to EBITDA (a) at all times while EBITDA in said ratio exceeds $25,000, not exceeding 3.0:1.0, and (b) at all other times, not exceeding 2.5:1.0; and\n\u00b7\nmaintain an interest coverage ratio of at least 3.0:1.0.\nWe may be unable to comply with the covenants under our credit agreement in the future. A failure to comply with the covenants under our credit agreement could result in an event of default. In the event of a default our lender could elect to declare all borrowings, accrued and unpaid interest and other fees outstanding, due and payable, and require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings.\nWe conduct virtually all manufacturing operations at a single location.\nVirtually all of our operations are conducted at our Whippany, New Jersey facility. Substantial impairment of this facility as a consequence of a natural disaster, work stoppage, or other event could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Our small product development center in Fredericksburg, Virginia is not able to assume the operations from the Whippany facility if the Whippany facility is substantially impaired.\nWe depend on component availability, subcontractor performance, and key suppliers to manufacture and deliver our products and services.\nWe depend upon suppliers to deliver component parts and, to some extent, to assemble components and subsystems to manufacture our products in a timely and satisfactory manner and to remain in full compliance with applicable customer terms and conditions. We are generally subject to specific procurement requirements, which may limit the suppliers and subcontractors we may utilize. In some instances, we are dependent on sole-source suppliers. If any of these suppliers or subcontractors fails to meet our needs, developing alternatives could cause delays and increase costs in meeting customer requirements. While we may enter into long-term or volume purchase agreements with certain suppliers and take other actions to ensure the availability of needed materials, components, and subsystems, we cannot be sure that such items will be available in the quantities we require, if at all. If we experience a material supplier or subcontractor problem, the ability to satisfactorily and timely meet customer obligations could be negatively impacted, which could result in reduced sales, termination of contracts, and damage to our reputation and customer relationships. We could also incur additional costs in addressing such a problem. Any of these events could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operating results and financial condition may be adversely impacted by the current worldwide economic conditions.\nWe currently generate operating cash flows, which combined with access to the credit markets, provides discretionary funding capacity. However, current uncertainty in the global economic conditions could impact customer demand for our products, as well as our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our customers, suppliers, and creditors. If economic conditions deteriorate significantly, our business could be negatively impacted from reduced demand for our products or supplier or customer disruptions.\nOur future growth and continued success depends upon retaining key employees.\nOur success depends on our senior management personnel and our ability to attract and retain other highly qualified management personnel. We face competition for management from other companies and organizations, and therefore may not be able to retain our existing management personnel or fill new management positions or vacancies created by expansion or turnover at existing compensation levels. We have entered into employment agreements with some members of senior management and have made efforts to reduce the effect of the loss of senior management personnel through succession planning. The loss of senior managers could have a material and adverse effect on our business. In addition, competition for qualified technical personnel in our industry is intense, and management believes that our future growth and success will depend upon the ability to attract, train, and retain such personnel.\nOur profitability could be negatively affected if we fail to maintain satisfactory labor relations.\nApproximately one-third of our workforce is employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the United Auto Workers (UAW), which from time to time is subject to renewal and negotiation. Although historically we have had satisfactory relations with both our unionized and non-unionized employees, if we are subject to labor actions, including work stoppages or slowdowns, we may experience an adverse impact on our operating results.\n($ in Thousands Except Share Amounts)\nOur failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could have an adverse effect on our business.\nIntellectual property is important to our success. We rely upon confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our business and proprietary technology. Our general policy is to enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and consultants, and nondisclosure agreements with all other parties to whom we disclose confidential information. In certain instances, we apply for legal protection for certain of our other intellectual property. The patents, trademarks and any additional legal protection we may obtain in the future may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. As a result, our means of protecting our proprietary technology and brands may be inadequate. Furthermore, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property. Any such infringement or misappropriation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPatent infringement claims against us or our customers, whether or not successful, may cause us to incur significant costs.\nWhile we do not believe that our products (including products and technologies licensed from others) infringe valid intellectual property rights of any third parties, there can be no assurance that infringement or invalidity claims (or claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims) will not be asserted against us or our customers. Damages for infringement of valid intellectual property rights of third parties could be substantial, and if determined to be willful, can be trebled. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operation. Regardless of the validity or the successful assertion of any such claims, we could incur significant costs and diversion of resources with respect to the defense thereof which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. If we are unsuccessful in defending any claims or actions that are asserted against us or our customers, we could seek to obtain a license under a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights. There can be no assurance, however, that under such circumstances, a license would be available under reasonable terms or at all. The failure to obtain a license to a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by security threats, including cyber security threats, and other disruptions.\nAs a defense contractor, we face various security threats, including cyber security threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, threats to the security of our facility and infrastructure, and threats from terrorist acts. Although we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor these threats and mitigate our exposure to such threats, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient in preventing security threats from materializing. If any of these events were to materialize, they could lead to losses of sensitive business information, critical infrastructure, personnel or capabilities, each of which is essential to our operations and the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nCyber security attacks in particular are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in mission critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. These events could damage our reputation and lead to financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability.\nWe use estimates when competing for contracts. Variances between actual and estimates could affect our profitability and overall financial position.\nThe competitive bidding process requires judgment relative to among other things, assessing risks, estimating future contract revenues and costs, and making assumptions for schedule and technical risks. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total revenues and costs at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. For example, assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract because costs also include expected increases in wages and prices for materials. Similarly, assumptions have to be made regarding the future impact of efficiency initiatives and cost reduction efforts. Incentives, awards, price escalations, or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating revenue and profit rates and are recorded when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated performance. Because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes described above, it is possible that materially different amounts could be obtained if different assumptions were used or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances, or estimates may have a material adverse effect upon future period financial reporting and performance.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nOur common stock is thinly traded and subject to volatility.\nAlthough our common stock is traded on the NYSE MKT, it may remain relatively illiquid, or \u201cthinly traded,\u201d which can increase share price volatility and make it difficult for investors to buy or sell shares in the public market without materially affecting the\n($ in Thousands Except Share Amounts)\nquoted share price. Investors may be unable to buy or sell a certain quantity of our shares in the public market within one or more trading days. If limited trading in our stock continues, it may be difficult for holders to sell their shares in the public market at any given time at prevailing prices. We have also historically not paid a dividend.\nThe prevailing market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u00b7\nActual or anticipated fluctuations in operating results;\n\u00b7\nChanges in market valuations of other similarly situated companies;\n\u00b7\nAnnouncements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations, contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments;\n\u00b7\nAdditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u00b7\nFuture sales of common stock;\n\u00b7\nAny deviations in net revenues or in losses from levels expected by the investment community;\n\u00b7\nTrading volume fluctuations; and\n\u00b7\nBusiness pressures on any of our large shareholders resulting from their holdings in other unrelated businesses.\nOur share ownership is highly concentrated.\nOur directors, officers, principal stockholders, and certain of their affiliates, beneficially own approximately 72% of our common stock and will continue to have significant influence over the outcome of all matters submitted to the stockholders for approval, including the election of our directors.", "PERMNO": 61209, "SIC": 3537, "TIC": "BZC"}
