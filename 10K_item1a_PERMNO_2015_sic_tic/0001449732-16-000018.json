{"cik": "1449732", "company": "Willbros Group, Inc.\\NEW\\", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe nature of our business and operations subjects us to a number of uncertainties and risks.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nOur business is highly dependent upon the level of capital expenditures by oil and gas and electric power companies on infrastructure.\nOur revenue and cash flow are primarily dependent upon major construction projects. The availability of these types of projects is dependent upon the economic condition of the oil and gas and electric power industries, and specifically, the level of capital expenditures of oil and gas and electric power companies on infrastructure. Our failure to obtain major projects, the delay in awards of major projects, the cancellation of major projects or delays in completion of contracts are factors that could result in the under-utilization of our resources, which would have an adverse impact on our revenue and cash flow. Numerous factors beyond our control influence the level of capital expenditures of these companies, including:\n\u2022\ncurrent and projected oil and gas and electric power prices;\n\u2022\nthe demand for gasoline and electricity;\n\u2022\nthe abilities of oil and gas and electric power companies to generate, access and deploy capital;\n\u2022\nexploration, production and transportation costs;\n\u2022\nthe discovery rate and location of new oil and gas reserves;\n\u2022\nthe sale and expiration dates of oil and gas leases and concessions;\n\u2022\nregulatory restraints on the rates that electric power companies may charge their customers;\n\u2022\nlocal and international political and economic conditions; and\n\u2022\ntechnological advances.\nIn particular, a large number of exploration and production and midstream companies have recently announced reductions in their capital expenditure budgets due to the recent and prolonged decline in crude oil and natural gas prices. Additional delays or cancellations of projects are likely to occur especially in those areas where the costs of production may exceed current commodity prices.\nWe face a risk of non-compliance with certain covenants in our credit facilities.\nWe are subject to a number of financial and other covenants under our credit facilities, including a Maximum Total Leverage Ratio and a Minimum Interest Coverage Ratio. On March 31, 2015, we amended our 2014 Term Credit Agreement pursuant to a First Amendment (the \u201cFirst Amendment\u201d). The First Amendment, among other things, suspends the calculation of the Maximum Total Leverage Ratio and Minimum Interest Coverage Ratio for the period from December 31, 2014 through March 31, 2016 (the \u201cFirst Amendment Covenant Suspension Period\u201d) and provides that any failure by us to comply with the Maximum Total Leverage Ratio or Minimum Interest Coverage Ratio covenants during the Covenant Suspension Period shall not be deemed to result in a default or event of default. On March 1, 2016, we further amended our 2014 Term Credit Agreement pursuant to a Third Amendment (the \"Third Amendment\"). The Third Amendment, among other things, extends the First Amendment Covenant Suspension Period for an additional quarterly calculation period ending June 30, 2016 (the \"Third Amendment Covenant Suspension Period\") so that any failure by us to comply with the Maximum Total Leverage Ratio or Minimum Interest Coverage Ratio covenants during the Third Amendment Covenant Suspension Period will not be deemed to result in a default or event of default.\nWe can provide no assurance that we will remain in compliance with our financial covenants in the periods following the completion of the Third Amendment Covenant Suspension Period or that we would be successful in obtaining additional waivers or amendments to these covenants should they become necessary. Under the Third Amendment, the Maximum Total Leverage Ratio decreases to 4.50 to 1.00 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2016, 3.25 to 1.00 as of March 31, 2017 and 3.00 to 1.00 as of June 30, 2017 and thereafter. The Minimum Interest Coverage Ratio increases to 1.75 to 1.00 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2016, 2.50 to 1.00 as of March 31, 2017 and 2.75 to 1.00 as of June 30, 2017 and thereafter. The Third Amendment further provides that, solely for the four quarter fiscal period ending September 30, 2016, Consolidated EBITDA will be equal to the sum of Consolidated EBITDA for the fiscal quarters ending June 30, 2016 and\nSeptember 30, 2016, multiplied by two. If our results of operations do not improve in 2016, we will be unable to meet the required financial covenants.\nIn order to ensure future compliance with our financial covenants, we may elect to prepay our credit agreement indebtedness by accessing capital markets, through proceeds from the sale, if necessary, of non-strategic assets, with cash on hand or through the reduction of overhead. In 2015, we completed the sale of our Professional Services segment and four non-strategic subsidiaries. However, we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in disposing of additional non-strategic assets, if necessary, accessing capital markets on terms we consider favorable or reducing costs in amounts sufficient to comply with our financial covenants.\nEven if we successfully comply with our financial covenants, we may suffer adverse consequences if our unused availability under our 2013 ABL Credit Facility drops below certain levels. If our unused availability under the 2013 ABL Credit Facility is less than the greater of (i) 15 percent of the revolving commitments or $15.0 million for five consecutive days, or (ii) 12.5 percent of the revolving commitments or $12.5 million at any time, we are subject to increased reporting requirements, the administrative agent will have exclusive control over any deposit account, we will not have any right of access to, or withdrawal from, any deposit account, or any right to direct the disposition of funds in any deposit account, and amounts in any deposit account will be applied to reduce the outstanding amounts under the 2013 ABL Credit Facility. In addition, if our unused availability under the 2013 ABL Credit Facility is less than the amounts described in the preceding sentence, we would be required to comply with a Minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio financial covenant.\nOur unused availability under the 2013 ABL Credit Facility was $47.0 million at December 31, 2015. We do not expect our availability under the 2013 ABL Credit Facility to drop to levels which would require us to comply with the Minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio covenant over the next 12 months. However, if the Minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio were to become applicable, we would not expect to be in compliance with this covenant.\nA default under the 2013 ABL Credit Facility would permit the lenders to terminate their commitment to make cash advances or issue letters of credit, require us to immediately repay any outstanding cash advances with interest and require us to cash collateralize outstanding letter of credit obligations. A default under the 2014 Term Credit Agreement would permit the lenders to require immediate repayment of all principal, interest, fees and other amounts payable thereunder. If the maturity of our credit agreement indebtedness were accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds to pay such indebtedness. In such an event, our lenders would be entitled to proceed against the collateral securing the indebtedness, which includes substantially all of our assets, to the extent permitted by the credit agreements and applicable law.\nWe have had material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in prior fiscal years. Failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations accurately and on a timely basis. As a result, our business, operating results and liquidity could be harmed.\nAs disclosed in our prior Annual Report on Form 10-K, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that led to the restatement of our previously issued consolidated financial statements for fiscal years 2002 and 2003, the first three quarters of 2004, the first three quarters of 2011 and the first two quarters of 2014. We also identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, 2011, and 2010 and for the years 2004 through 2007. We believe that all of these material weaknesses have been successfully remediated.\nOur failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis, which could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports or have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business or access sources of liquidity. Furthermore, because of the inherent limitations of any system of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls and fraud, even effective internal controls may not prevent or detect all misstatements.\nA pending securities class action against us has resulted in significant costs and expenses, has diverted resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nAs further described in Note 13 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, after we announced that we would be restating our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2014, a securities class action complaint was filed against us in the United States District Court for the Southern\nDistrict of Texas on behalf of our shareholders and alleging damages on their behalf arising from the matters that led to the restatements. In addition to us, two of our former Chief Executive Officers and our current Chief Financial Officer are named as defendants. We have incurred and/or expect to incur significant professional fees and other costs in defending against the class action. If we do not prevail in the pending litigation, we may be required to pay a significant amount of monetary damages that may be in excess of our insurance coverage. In addition, our Board of Directors, management and employees may expend a substantial amount of time on the pending litigation, diverting resources and attention that would otherwise be directed toward our operations and implementation of our business strategy, all of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur settlements with the DOJ and the SEC may negatively impact us in the event of a future FCPA violation. Our failure to comply with the FCPA or other anti-bribery laws would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn May 2008, after reaching agreement with the Company, the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") filed an Information and Deferred Prosecution Agreement (\"DPA\") concluding its investigation into violations of the FCPA by Willbros Group, Inc. and its subsidiary, Willbros International, Inc. (\"WII\"). Also in May 2008, we reached a final settlement with the SEC to resolve its previously disclosed investigations of possible violations of the FCPA and possible violations of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These investigations stemmed primarily from our former operations in Bolivia, Ecuador and Nigeria. We made the final payments under these settlements in October 2011. The criminal information associated with the DPA was dismissed, with prejudice, on April 2, 2012. Currently, we have no employees working outside of the United States and Canada.\nUnder the SEC settlement, we are permanently enjoined from committing any future violations of the federal securities laws.\nOur failure to abide by the FCPA and other laws could result in prosecution and other regulatory sanctions and severely impact our operations. A criminal conviction for violations of the FCPA could result in fines, civil and criminal penalties and equitable remedies, including profit disgorgement and injunctive relief, and would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur use of fixed price contracts could adversely affect our operating results.\nA significant portion of our revenues is currently generated by fixed price contracts. Under a fixed price contract, we agree on the price that we will receive for the entire project, based upon a defined scope, which includes specific assumptions and project criteria. If our estimates of our own costs to complete the project are below the actual costs that we may incur, our margins will decrease, and we may incur a loss. The revenue, cost and gross profit realized on a fixed price contract will often vary from the estimated amounts because of unforeseen conditions or changes in job conditions and variations in labor and equipment productivity over the term of the contract. If we are unsuccessful in mitigating these risks, we may realize gross profits that are different from those originally estimated and incur reduced profitability or losses on projects. Depending on the size of a project, these variations from estimated contract performance could have a significant effect on our operating results for any quarter or year. In general, turnkey contracts to be performed on a fixed price basis involve an increased risk of significant variations. This is a result of the long-term nature of these contracts and the inherent difficulties in estimating costs and of the interrelationship of the integrated services to be provided under these contracts, whereby unanticipated costs or delays in performing part of the contract can have compounding effects by increasing costs of performing other parts of the contract.\nIn addition, our Utility T&D segment also generates substantial revenue under unit price contracts under which we have agreed to perform identified units of work for an agreed price, which have similar associated risks as those identified above for fixed price contracts. A \u201cunit\u201d can be as small as the installation of a single bolt or a foot of cable or as large as a transmission tower or foundation. The resulting profitability of a particular unit is primarily dependent upon the labor and equipment hours expended to complete the task that comprises the unit. Failure to accurately estimate the costs of completing a particular project could result in reduced profits or losses.\nPercentage-of-completion method of accounting for contract revenue may result in adjustments that would materially affect our operating results.\nWe recognize contract revenue using the percentage-of-completion method on long-term fixed price contracts. Under this method, estimated contract revenue is accrued based generally on the percentage that costs to date bear to total estimated costs, taking into consideration physical completion. Estimated contract losses are recognized in full when determined. Accordingly, contract revenue and total cost estimates are reviewed and revised periodically as the work progresses and as change orders are approved, and adjustments based upon the percentage-of-completion are reflected in contract revenue in the period when these estimates are revised. These estimates are based on management\u2019s reasonable assumptions and our historical experience, and are only estimates. Variation of actual results from these assumptions or our historical experience could be material. To the extent that these adjustments result in an increase, a reduction or an elimination of previously reported contract revenue, we would recognize a credit or a charge against current earnings, which could be material.\nOur backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and is, therefore, an uncertain indicator of our future earnings.\nWe cannot guarantee that the revenue projected in our backlog will be realized or profitable. Projects may remain in our backlog for an extended period of time. In addition, project cancellations, terminations or scope adjustments may occur from time to time with respect to contracts reflected in our backlog and could reduce the dollar amount of our backlog and the revenue and profits that we actually earn. Many of our contracts have termination for convenience provisions in them, in some cases without any provision for penalties or lost profits. Therefore, project terminations, suspensions or scope adjustments may occur from time to time with respect to contracts in our backlog. Finally, poor project or contract performance could also impact our backlog and profits.\nManaging backlog in our Utility T&D segment also has other challenges. Backlog for anticipated projects in this segment is determined based on recurring historical trends, seasonal demand and projected customer needs, but the agreements in this segment rarely have minimum volume or spending obligations, and many of the contracts may be terminated by the customers on short notice. For projects in this segment on which we have commenced work that are cancelled, we may be reimbursed for certain costs, but typically have no contractual right to the total revenues included in our backlog.\nFederal and state legislative and regulatory developments that we believe should encourage electric power transmission and natural gas pipeline infrastructure spending may fail to result in increased demand for our Utility T&D and Oil & Gas services.\nIn recent years, federal and state legislation has been passed and resulting regulations have been adopted that could significantly increase spending on electric power transmission and natural gas pipeline infrastructure, including the Energy Act of 2005 and state Renewable Portfolio Standard (\u201cRPS\u201d) programs. However, much fiscal, regulatory and other uncertainty remains as to the impact this legislation and regulation will ultimately have on the demand for our Utility T&D and Oil & Gas services.\nRPS initiatives may not lead to increased demand for our Utility T&D services. A majority of states and Washington D.C. have mandatory RPS programs that require certain percentages of power to be generated from renewable sources. However, for budgetary or other reasons, states may reduce those mandates or make them optional or extend deadlines, which could reduce, delay or eliminate renewable energy development in the affected states. Furthermore, renewable energy is generally more expensive to produce and may require additional power generation sources as backup. Funding for RPS programs may not be available or may be further constrained as a result of the significant declines in government budgets and subsidies and in the availability of credit to finance the significant capital expenditures necessary to build renewable generation capacity. Funding for RPS programs may also be constrained by low prevailing commodity prices for conventional fossil fuels. These factors could lead to fewer projects resulting from RPS programs than anticipated or a delay in the timing of these projects and the related infrastructure, which would negatively affect the demand for our Utility T&D services. Moreover, even if the RPS programs are fully developed and funded, we cannot be certain that we will be awarded any resulting contracts. In addition, infrastructure projects are also subject to delays or cancellation due to local factors such as siting disputes, protests and litigation. Before we will receive revenues from infrastructure build-outs associated with any of these projects, substantial advance preparations are required such as engineering, procurement, and acquisition and clearance of rights-of-way, all of which are beyond our control. Investments for renewable energy and electric power infrastructure may not occur, may be less than anticipated or may be delayed, may be concentrated in locations where we do not have significant capabilities, and any\nresulting contracts may not be awarded to us, any of which could negatively impact demand for our Utility T&D services.\nIn addition, the increase in long-term demand for natural gas that we believe will benefit from anticipated U.S. greenhouse gas regulations may be delayed or may not occur, which could affect the demand for our Oil & Gas services. It is difficult to accurately predict the timing and scope of any potential federal or state greenhouse gas regulations that may ultimately be adopted or the extent to which demand for natural gas will increase as a result of any such regulations.\nSeasonal variations and inclement weather may cause fluctuations in our operating results, profitability, cash flow and working capital needs related to our operating segments.\nA significant portion of our business in each of our operating segments is performed outdoors. Consequently, our results of operations are exposed to seasonal variations and inclement weather. Our operating segments perform less work in the winter months, and work is hindered during other inclement weather events. In particular, our Utility T&D segment revenue and profitability often decrease during the winter months and during severe weather conditions because work performed during these periods is more costly to complete. During periods of peak electric power demand in the summer, utilities generally are unable to remove their electric power T&D equipment from service, decreasing the demand for our maintenance services during such periods. The seasonality of this segment\u2019s business also causes our working capital needs to fluctuate. Because this segment\u2019s operating cash flow is usually lower during and immediately following the winter months, we typically experience a need to finance a portion of this segment\u2019s working capital during the spring and summer. Conversely, our Canada segment typically posts its strongest results during the winter and summer months and weaker results during what is known as the \"Spring breakup,\" when road bans and load limits are put in place and workers are often furloughed and equipment idled. Severe winter weather can also create demand for restoration of storm damage to overhead utility lines, which can offer opportunities for high margin emergency restoration work for our Utility T&D segment.\nOur failure to recover adequately on claims against project owners for payment could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe occasionally bring claims against project owners for additional costs exceeding the contract price or for amounts not included in the original contract price. These types of claims occur due to matters such as owner-caused delays or changes from the initial project scope, which result in additional costs, both direct and indirect. These claims can be the subject of lengthy arbitration or litigation proceedings, and it is often difficult to accurately predict when these claims will be fully resolved. When these types of events occur and unresolved claims are pending, we may invest significant working capital in projects to cover cost overruns pending the resolution of the relevant claims. A failure to promptly recover on these types of claims could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial condition.\nOur business is dependent on a limited number of key clients.\nWe operate primarily in the oil and gas and power industries, providing services to a limited number of clients. Much of our success depends on developing and maintaining relationships with our major clients and obtaining a share of contracts from these clients. The loss of any of our major clients could have a material adverse effect on our operations. One client was responsible for approximately 17.9 percent of total contract revenue from continuing operations in 2015. This client was also responsible for 35.8 percent of our 12 month backlog and 56.6 percent of our total backlog from continuing operations at December 31, 2015.\nTerrorist attacks and war or risk of war may adversely affect our results of operations, our ability to raise capital or secure insurance, or our future growth.\nThe continued threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action will likely lead to continued volatility in prices for crude oil and natural gas and could affect the markets for our operations. In addition, future acts of terrorism could be directed against companies operating both outside and inside the United States. Further, the U.S. government has issued public warnings that indicate that pipelines and other energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations. These developments may subject our operations to increased risks and, depending on their ultimate magnitude, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur operations are subject to a number of operational risks.\nOur business operations include pipeline construction, fabrication, pipeline rehabilitation services and a wide range of services in electric power and natural gas transmission and distribution. These operations involve a high degree of operational risk. Natural disasters, adverse weather conditions, collisions and operator error could cause personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, equipment and the environment, and suspension of operations. In locations where we perform work with equipment that is owned by others, our continued use of the equipment can be subject to unexpected or arbitrary interruption or termination. The occurrence of any of these events could result in work stoppage, loss of revenue, casualty loss, increased costs and significant liability to third parties.\nThe insurance protection we maintain may not be sufficient or effective under all circumstances or against all hazards to which we may be subject. An enforceable claim for which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, we may not be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable.\nUnsatisfactory safety performance may subject us to penalties, can affect customer relationships, result in higher operating costs, negatively impact employee morale and result in higher employee turnover.\nWorkplace safety is important to us, our employees, and our customers. As a result, we maintain comprehensive safety programs and training to all applicable employees throughout our organization. While we focus on protecting people and property, our work is performed at construction sites and in industrial facilities and our workers are subject to the normal hazards associated with providing these services. Even with proper safety precautions, these hazards can lead to personal injury, loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, plant and equipment, and environmental damage. We are intensely focused on maintaining a strong safety environment and reducing the risk of accidents to the lowest possible level.\nAlthough we have taken what we believe are appropriate precautions to adequately train and equip our employees, we have experienced serious accidents, including fatalities, in the past and may experience additional accidents in the future. Serious accidents may subject us to penalties, civil litigation or criminal prosecution. Claims for damages to persons, including claims for bodily injury or loss of life, could result in costs and liabilities, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe may become liable for the obligations of our joint ventures and our subcontractors.\nSome of our projects are performed through joint ventures with other parties. In addition to the usual liability of contractors for the completion of contracts and the warranty of our work, where work is performed through a joint venture, we also have potential liability for the work performed by the joint venture itself. In these projects, even if we satisfactorily complete our project responsibilities within budget, we may incur additional unforeseen costs due to the failure of the joint ventures to perform or complete work in accordance with contract specifications.\nWe act as prime contractor on a majority of the construction projects we undertake. In our capacity as prime contractor and when acting as a subcontractor, we perform most of the work on our projects with our own resources and typically subcontract only certain specialized activities such as hazardous waste removal, nondestructive inspection and catering and security. However, with respect to other contracts, including those in our Utility T&D segment, we may choose to subcontract a portion or substantial portion of the project. In the construction industry, the prime contractor is normally responsible for the performance of the entire contract, including subcontract work. Thus, when acting as a prime contractor, we are subject to the risks associated with the failure of one or more subcontractors to perform as anticipated.\nWe are self-insured against many potential liabilities.\nAlthough we maintain insurance policies with respect to automobile liability, general liability, workers\u2019 compensation and employee group health claims, many of those policies are subject to substantial deductibles, and we are self-insured up to the amount of the deductible. Since most claims against us do not exceed the deductibles under our insurance policies, we are effectively self-insured for the overwhelming majority of claims. We actuarially determine any liabilities for unpaid claims and associated expenses, including incurred but not reported losses, and reflect those liabilities in our balance sheet as other current and noncurrent liabilities. The determination of such claims and expenses and the appropriateness of the liability is reviewed and updated quarterly. However, insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to many relevant factors, the effects of which are often unknown, including the severity of an injury, the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties,\nthe number of incidents not reported and the effectiveness of our safety program. If our insurance claims increase or costs exceed our estimates of insurance liabilities, we could experience a decline in profitability and liquidity.\nOur operations expose us to potential environmental liabilities.\nOur U.S. and Canadian operations are subject to numerous environmental protection laws and regulations which are complex and stringent. We regularly perform work in and around sensitive environmental areas, such as rivers, lakes and wetlands. Part of the business in our Utility T&D segment is performed in the southwestern U.S. where there is a greater risk of fines, work stoppages or other sanctions for disturbing Native American artifacts and archeological sites. Significant fines, penalties and other sanctions may be imposed for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations, and some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liabilities for remediation of releases of hazardous substances, rendering a person liable for environmental damage, without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such person. In addition to potential liabilities that may be incurred in satisfying these requirements, we may be subject to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as a result of alleged exposure to hazardous substances. These laws and regulations may expose us to liability arising out of the conduct of operations or conditions caused by others, or for our acts which were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time these acts were performed.\nWe own and operate several properties in the United States and Canada that have been used for a number of years for the storage and maintenance of equipment and upon which hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed or released. Any release of substances by us or by third parties who previously operated on these properties may be subject to the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (\u201cCERCLA\u201d), the Resource Compensation and Recovery Act (\u201cRCRA\u201d), and/or analogous state, provincial or local laws. CERCLA imposes joint and several liabilities, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment, while RCRA governs the generation, storage, transfer and disposal of hazardous wastes. Under these or similar laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes and clean up contaminated property. This could have a significant impact on our future results.\nOur operations outside of the U.S. and Canada are often times potentially subject to similar governmental or provincial controls and restrictions relating to the environment.\nWe are unable to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business segments.\nRecent scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as \u201cgreenhouse gases,\u201d may be contributing to warming of the earth\u2019s atmosphere. As a result, there have been a variety of regulatory developments, proposals or requirements and legislative initiatives that have been introduced and/or issued in the United States (as well as other parts of the world) that are focused on restricting the emission of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases. Although it is difficult to accurately predict how such legislation or regulations, including those introduced or adopted in the future, would impact our business and operations, it is possible that such laws and regulations could result in greater compliance costs, capital spending requirements or operating restrictions for us and/or our customers and could adversely affect the demand for some of our services.\nOur industry is highly competitive, which could impede our growth.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment. A substantial number of the major projects that we pursue are awarded based on bid proposals. We compete for these projects against companies that have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. In some markets, there is competition from national and regional firms against which we may not be able to compete on price. Our growth may be impacted to the extent that we are unable to successfully bid against these companies. Our competitors may have lower overhead cost structures, greater resources or other advantages and, therefore, may be able to provide their services at lower rates than ours or elect to place bids on projects that drive down margins to lower levels than we would accept.\nWe are dependent upon the services of our executive management.\nOur success depends heavily on the continued services of our executive management. Our management team is the nexus of our operational experience and customer relationships. Our ability to manage business risk and satisfy the expectations of our clients, stockholders and other stakeholders is dependent upon the collective experience and relationships of our management\nteam. We do not maintain key man life insurance for these individuals.\nIn the past few years, we have experienced significant turnover at the senior management level. We believe that we currently have in place competitive compensation programs with strong retention incentives for our senior management. However, the loss or interruption of services provided by one or more of our senior officers could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur business is labor intensive, and we may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees.\nOur ability to maintain our productivity and improve profitability will be limited by our ability to employ, train and retain skilled personnel necessary to meet our requirements. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain an adequate skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and to support our strategy.\nWe contribute to multi-employer plans that could result in liabilities to us if those plans are terminated or we withdraw from those plans.\nWe contribute to several multi-employer pension plans for employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. These plans are not administered by us and contributions are determined in accordance with provisions of negotiated labor contracts. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the Multi-employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980, imposes certain liabilities upon employers who are contributors to a multi-employer plan in the event of the employer\u2019s withdrawal from, or upon termination of, such plan. In addition, if the funding of any of these multi-employer plans becomes in \u201ccritical status\u201d under the Pension Protection Act of 2006, we could be required to make significant additional contributions to those plans.\nA number of plans to which our business units contribute or may contribute in the future are in \u201cendangered\u201d or \u201ccritical\u201d status. Certain of these plans may require additional contributions, generally in the form of a surcharge on future benefit contributions required for future work performed by union employees covered by these plans. The amount of additional funds, if any, that we may be obligated to contribute to these plans in the future cannot be estimated, as such amounts will likely be based on future levels of work that require the specific use of those union employees covered by these plans.\nSpecial risks associated with doing business in highly corrupt environments may adversely affect our business.\nOur international business operations may include projects in countries where corruption is prevalent. Since the anti-bribery restrictions of the FCPA make it illegal for us to give anything of value to foreign officials in order to obtain or retain any business or other advantage, we may be subject to competitive disadvantages to the extent that our competitors are able to secure business, licenses or other preferential treatment by making payments to government officials and others in positions of influence. Currently, we have no employees working outside of the United States and Canada.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nIf we cannot meet the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\") continued listing requirements, the NYSE may delist our common stock.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the NYSE. In the future, if we are not able to meet the continued listing requirements of the NYSE, which require, among other things, that the average closing price of our common stock not fall below $1.00 over 30 consecutive trading days, we would fall below compliance standards and risk having our common stock delisted if we are not able to regain compliance.\nOn August 11, 2015, we received a notice from the NYSE that we were not in compliance with the continued listing standard set forth in NYSE Listed Company Manual Rule 802.01C because our common stock traded below the minimum average closing share price of $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period. However, on October 1, 2015, we received a subsequent letter from the NYSE confirming that our average stock price for the 30 trading days ended September 30, 2015 was above the NYSE's minimum requirement of $1.00 and that were are no longer considered to be below the $1.00 continued listing criterion.\nIn the event that we are once again notified by the NYSE that we have fallen below the average closing price compliance standard, we intend to respond to the NYSE within 10 business days with a plan to cure the deficiency. We would have six months, or in certain circumstances, until we could take stockholder action at our next annual meeting, to regain compliance with the NYSE listing requirements. During the cure period, our common stock would continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE, subject to compliance with the other listing standards. Such a NYSE notification would not conflict with or violate any of our credit or debt obligations.\nA delisting of our common stock could negatively impact us by, among other things:\n\u2022\nreducing the liquidity and market price of our common stock;\n\u2022\nreducing the number of investors, including institutional investors, willing to hold or acquire our common stock, which could negatively impact our ability to raise equity;\n\u2022\ndecreasing the amount of news and analyst coverage by us;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to issue additional securities, obtain additional financing or pursue strategic restructuring, refinancing or other transactions; and\n\u2022\nimpacting our reputation and, as a consequence, our ability to attract new business.\nOur common stock, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations are likely to continue in the future, and you may not be able to resell your shares of common stock at or above the purchase price paid by you.\nThe market price of our common stock may change significantly in response to various factors and events beyond our control, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe risk factors described in this Item 1A;\n\u2022\na shortfall in operating revenue or net income from that expected by securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022\nchanges in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial performance or the financial performance of our competitors or companies in our industries generally;\n\u2022\ngeneral conditions in our customers\u2019 industries; and\n\u2022\ngeneral conditions in the securities markets.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws may inhibit a takeover, which may adversely affect the performance of our stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals or make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, which may adversely affect the price that investors might be willing to pay for our common stock. For example, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws:\n\u2022\nprovide for a classified board of directors, which allows only one-third of our directors to be elected each year;\n\u2022\ndeny stockholders the ability to take action by written consent;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our Board of Directors and business to be brought by stockholders before any meeting of the stockholders;\n\u2022\nprovide that special meetings of stockholders may be called only by our Board of Directors, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer or President; and\n\u2022\nauthorize our Board of Directors to designate the terms of and to approve the issuance of new series of preferred stock.\nFuture sales of our common stock may depress our stock price.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or otherwise, either by us, a member of management or a major stockholder, or the perception that these sales could occur, may depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.\nIn the event we issue stock as consideration for acquisitions or to fund our corporate activities, we may dilute share ownership.\nWe grow our business organically as well as through acquisitions. One method of acquiring companies or otherwise funding our corporate activities is through the issuance of additional equity securities. If we do issue additional equity securities, such issuances may have the effect of diluting our earnings per share as well as our existing stockholders\u2019 individual ownership percentages in our Company.\nOur future sale of common stock, preferred stock, warrants or convertible securities may lead to further dilution of our issued and outstanding stock.\nOur authorized shares of common stock consist of 105 million shares. The issuance of additional common stock or securities convertible into our common stock would result in further dilution of the ownership interest in us held by existing stockholders. We are authorized to issue, without stockholder approval, one million shares of preferred stock, which may give other stockholders dividend, conversion, voting and liquidation rights, among other rights, which may be superior to the rights of holders of our common stock. While our Board of Directors has no present intention of authorizing the issuance of any such preferred stock, it reserves the right to do so in the future.", "PERMNO": 83834, "SIC": 1623, "TIC": "WGRP"}
