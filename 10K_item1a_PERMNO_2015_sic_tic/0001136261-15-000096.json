{"cik": "1285701", "company": "MMRGlobal, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-31", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree risk. Before making a decision to invest in shares of our common stock, you should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as the other information contained in this annual report. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospectus could be materially adversely affected. If this were to occur, the trading price of our common stock could decline significantly and you may lose all or part of your investment in our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nIt is anticipated that we will continue to incur losses and negative cash flow from operations for the foreseeable future and our ability to continue is a going concern.\nHistorically, we have generated only minimal revenue. While our business includes personal healthcare record and document imaging and storage products that are currently available, we are nevertheless still at an early stage in developing a business model that will enable us to generate significant revenue from the sales, use and or licensing of our products. Prior to the Merger, MMR, Inc. financed its operations primarily through private placements of MMR, Inc. capital stock and from secured loans from The RHL Group, Inc., a wholly-owned affiliate of MMR, Inc.'s founder and Chief Executive Officer, and our current Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Robert H. Lorsch. Although we expect to continue to receive financing from The RHL Group, we have also continued to incur losses from operations and need additional sources of financing to fund our operations until we develop a profitable business. Even with additional funds from The RHL Group, there is no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient revenue and working capital to fund our operations and create a sustainable going concern. As a result, it is expected that we will continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future.\nIf we fail to obtain additional financing, we will be unable to fund our operations.\nWe expect that the cash used in our operations will increase for the next several years. As of December 31, 2014, our current liabilities exceeded our current assets by $8,564,976. Furthermore, during the year ended December 31, 2014, we incurred losses of $2,180,212. At the current level of borrowing, we require cash of $275,000 per year to service our debt and, in order to continue operating its business, we use an average of $278,000 cash per month, or $3.3 million per year.\nIn addition to the above cash burn from operations, we will be required to obtain additional financing in order to meet the obligations for installment payments of $621,000 under the Creditor Plan, and our obligations under the secured indebtedness to The RHL Group (which note payable had a balance of $1,281,852 at December 31, 2014), among other debt obligations. Such obligations are currently due and payable pursuant to the terms of the notes.\nTo finance our activities, we have relied on the issuance of stock and debt to the RHL Group. At December 31, 2014, we had a line of credit with the RHL Group in the amount of $4.5 million. Availability under this line of credit was $2.97 million as of December 31, 2014.\nNotwithstanding the above, at this rate of cash burn, over the next twelve months, our existing current assets, our equity raises and projected revenues under current agreements will sustain our business for less than one year.\nAlthough we generate some cash from our operations which include licensing agreements for our Health IT and Biotech assets, we will need additional financing in order to fund operations until we can become cash flow positive, which may not occur in 2015.\nOur future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:\nThe pace of market adoption of current and future products, which is being influenced by government requirements starting in 2014;\nThe length of sales cycles and implementation efforts for major corporate accounts, which experience shows takes at least twelve months;\nThe length of time required to litigate patent infringement cases, which experience shows takes at least two years;\nThe size of the amounts received from licensing, litigation judgments, or settlement agreements;\nThe costs of modernizing our current web-site and landing pages to meet mandate requirements under any new government initiatives;\nThe costs of modernizing our current web-site and landing pages to work on wireless devices and other new technologies\nThe cost of launching new products and services; and\nThe cost of maintaining a growing sales, service, and delivery organization.\nIf additional debt financing is raised in the future, we may be required to grant lenders an interest in a portion of our assets and issue warrants to acquire our equity securities, resulting in dilution to our stockholders. In addition, any such debt financing may involve restrictive covenants, including, limitations on our ability to acquire or assign intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could impact our ability to conduct our business. Further, our ability to raise funding through the sale of equity securities will be significantly limited by our existing authorized but unissued common stock. We currently have a limited amount of available common stock and any changes to our certificate of incorporation to increase our authorized share capital would require a vote of our stockholders, which could be time consuming and costly to obtain.\nFuture additional funding may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, then we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of one or more of our products.\nWe have been, and may continue to be, unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt obligations.\nOur ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund our operations, working capital and capital expenditures, depends on our ability to generate cash in the future, which is subject to our ability to execute on our business plan, and also to general economic, industry, financial, competitive, operating, and other factors that are beyond our control.\nWe have a secured credit facility with The RHL Group, with all outstanding amounts due thereunder being guaranteed by us. As of December 31, 2014, the aggregate principal amount owed under The RHL Group credit facility was $1,281,852.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we owed an aggregate of $1,255,747 in principal amount to certain of our pre-merger former employees and creditors, as evidenced by promissory notes issued to the same in connection with the Merger. Although we were obligated to make 18 monthly payments to such employees and creditors beginning August 2, 2009, we have not yet made any of the payments and thus they could attempt to exercise any rights as may be available to them under applicable law.\nWe cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay amounts due on our existing indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. Thus, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness or obtain additional financing will depend on, among other things:\nOur financial condition at the time;\nRestrictions in our outstanding debt instruments; and\nOther factors, including the condition of the financial markets.\nAs a result, we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, and additional borrowings or refinancing's or other proceeds are not available to us, we may not have sufficient cash to enable us to meet all of our obligations.\nThe level of our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe continue to have significant debt service obligations. As of December 31, 2014, the aggregate principal amount owed under all of our outstanding debt was approximately $2.3 million, the majority of which is owed to The RHL Group, a company controlled by our CEO. Our indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:\nIncrease our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;\nRestrict us from making strategic acquisitions, acquiring new content or exploring other business opportunities;\nLimit our ability to obtain financing for working capital, capital expenditures, general corporate purposes or acquisitions;\nPlace us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness; and\nLimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry.\nOur operations are subject to all of the risks inherent in a growing business enterprise, including the likelihood of operating losses. As a smaller company with a limited operating history, our success will depend, among other factors, upon how we manage the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays frequently encountered in connection with the growth of a new business, products and channels of distribution, and current and future development, as well as in the competitive emerging healthcare records management business.\nAny significant limitation or failure of our technology systems that are critical to our operations could constrain our operations.\nWe are highly dependent upon the use of third-party technology systems to operate our business. Any failures in these systems could disrupt our business and subject us to losses. Moreover, although we have in place certain disaster recovery plans and backup servers, we may experience system delays and interruptions as a result of natural disasters, power failures, acts of war, and third-party failures. Potential system failures and the cost necessary to address them could result in material financial loss or costs, regulatory actions, breach of client contracts, reputational harm or legal claims and liability, which in turn could negatively impact our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to continue to maximize our assets or protect our proprietary rights, which may hurt our competitive position and future revenues.\nWe will only be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties to the extent that these rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets and are otherwise protectable under applicable law. We will continue to protect our proprietary position by filing and maintaining U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary products, technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business, to notice organizations that may be infringing on our Intellectual property, and to file claims where necessary.\nIn addition to patents for future and current products, we own a substantial portfolio of assets acquired from Favrille, including data, samples, and other intellectual property rights. We currently seek protection for these assets, in part, through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements. These agreements may not provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for proprietary technology in the event of unauthorized use, transfer or disclosure of confidential and proprietary information. The parties may not comply with or may breach these agreements. Furthermore, our trade secrets may otherwise become known to, or be independently developed by, competitors.\nThe patent positions of biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies involve complex legal and factual questions and, therefore, enforceability cannot be predicted with certainty. Patents, if issued, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. Thus, any patents that we own or license from third parties for future products may not provide any protection against competitors. Pending patent applications we may file in the future, or those we may license from third parties, may not result in patents being issued. Also, patent rights may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, others may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology that we have developed or we will develop. The laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States.\nOur success will further depend, in part, on our ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. If our activities infringe on patents owned by others, we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves in suits brought against a licensor or us. Should our products or technologies be found to infringe on patents issued to third parties, the manufacture, use and sale of our products could be enjoined, and we could be required to pay substantial damages. In addition, we, in connection with the development and use of our products and technologies, may be required to obtain licenses to patents or other proprietary rights of third parties, which may not be made available on terms acceptable to us.\nIn connection with patent enforcement actions conducted by us, a court may rule that we have violated certain statutory, regulatory, federal, local or governing rules or standards, which may expose us to certain material liabilities.\nIn connection with any of our patent enforcement actions, it is possible that a defendant may request and/or a court may rule that we have violated statutory authority, regulatory authority, federal rules, local court rules, or governing standards relating to the substantive or procedural aspects of such enforcement actions. In such event, a court may issue monetary sanctions against us or award attorney's fees and/or expenses to a defendant(s), which could be material, and if we are required to pay such monetary sanctions, attorneys' fees and/or expenses, such payment could materially harm our operating results and our financial position\nOur licensing cycle is lengthy and costly, and our marketing, legal and sales efforts may be unsuccessful.\nWe expect our operating subsidiaries to incur significant marketing, legal and sales expenses prior to entering into license agreements and generating license revenues. We will also spend considerable resources educating prospective licensees on the benefits of a license arrangement with us. As such, we may incur significant losses in any particular period before any associated revenue stream begins.\nIf our efforts to educate prospective licensees on the benefits of a license arrangement are unsuccessful, we may need to pursue litigation or other enforcement action to protect our patent rights. We may also need to litigate to enforce the terms of our existing license agreements, protect our trade secrets, or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Enforcement proceedings are typically protracted and complex. The costs are typically substantial, and the outcomes are unpredictable. Enforcement actions will divert our managerial, technical, legal and financial resources from business operations.\nOur exposure to uncontrollable outside influences, including new legislation, court rulings or actions by Congress or the United States Patent and Trademark Office, could adversely affect our licensing and enforcement business and results of operations.\nIf new legislation, regulations or rules are implemented either by Congress, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, or the courts that impact the patent application process, the patent enforcement process or the rights of patent holders, such changes could negatively affect our expenses and revenue. Recently, United States patent laws were amended with the enactment of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the America Invents Act, which took effect on March 16, 2013. The America Invents Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. In general, the legislation attempts to address issues surrounding the enforceability of patents and the increase in patent litigation by, among other things, establishing new procedures for patent litigation. For example, the America Invents Act changes the way that parties may be joined in patent infringement actions, increasing the likelihood that such actions will need to be brought against individual allegedly-infringing parties by their respective individual actions or activities. In addition, the America Invents Act enacted a new inter-partes review (\"IPR\") process at the USPTO which can be used by defendants, and other individuals and entities, to separately challenge the validity of any patent. At this time, it is not clear what, if any, impact the America Invents Act will have on the operation of our enforcement business. However, the America Invents Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the enforcement of our patented technologies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nIn addition, the U.S. Department of Justice, or the DOJ, has conducted reviews of the patent system to evaluate the impact of patent assertion entities on industries in which those patents relate. It is possible that the findings and recommendations of the DOJ could impact the ability to effectively license and enforce standards-essential patents and could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the enforcement of any such patented technologies.\nFinally, new rules regarding the burden of proof in patent enforcement actions could significantly increase the cost of our enforcement actions, and new standards or limitations on liability for patent infringement could negatively impact our revenue derived from such enforcement actions.\nChanges in patent law could adversely impact our business.\nPatent laws may continue to change, and may alter the historically consistent protections afforded to owners of patent rights. Such changes may not be advantageous for us and may make it more difficult to obtain adequate patent protection to enforce our patents against infringing parties. Increased focus on the growing number of patent-related lawsuits may result in legislative changes which increase our costs and related risks of asserting patent enforcement actions. For instance, the United States House of Representatives passed a bill that would require non-practicing entities that bring patent infringement lawsuits to pay legal costs of the defendants, if the lawsuits are unsuccessful and certain standards are not met.\nWe may need to appeal adverse decisions by lower courts in order to successfully enforce our patents.\nIt is difficult to predict the outcome of patent enforcement litigation at the trial level. It is often difficult for juries and trial judges to understand complex, patented technologies, and as a result, there is a higher rate of successful appeals in patent enforcement litigation than more standard business litigation. Such appeals are expensive and time consuming, resulting in increased costs and delayed revenue. Although we diligently pursue enforcement litigation, we cannot predict with significant reliability the decisions made by juries and trial courts.\nMore patent applications are filed each year resulting in longer delays in getting patents issued by the USPTO.\nWe continue to acquire pending patents. We have identified a trend of increasing patent applications each year, which we believe is resulting in longer delays in obtaining approval of pending patent applications. The application delays could cause delays in recognizing revenue from these patents and could cause us to miss opportunities to license patents before other competing technologies are developed or introduced into the market.\nFederal courts are becoming more crowded, and as a result, patent enforcement litigation is taking longer.\nOur patent enforcement actions are almost exclusively prosecuted in federal court. Federal trial courts that hear our patent enforcement actions also hear criminal cases. Criminal cases always take priority over our actions. As a result, it is difficult to predict the length of time it will take to complete an enforcement action. Moreover, we believe there is a trend in increasing numbers of civil lawsuits and criminal proceedings before federal judges and, as a result, we believe that the risk of delays in our patent enforcement actions will have a greater effect on our business in the future unless this trend changes.\nAny reductions in the funding of the USPTO could have an adverse impact on the cost of processing pending patent applications and the value of those pending patent applications.\nThe assets of our operating subsidiaries consist of patent portfolios, including pending patent applications before the USPTO. The value of our patent portfolios is dependent upon the issuance of patents in a timely manner, and any reductions in the funding of the USPTO could negatively impact the value of our assets. Further, reductions in funding from Congress could result in higher patent application filing and maintenance fees charged by the USPTO, causing an unexpected increase in our expenses.\nOur patented technologies face uncertain market value.\nMany of our Patents are in the early stages of adoption in the commercial and consumer markets. Demand for some of these technologies is untested and is subject to fluctuation based upon the rate at which our licensees will adopt our patents and technologies in their products and services.\nAs patent enforcement litigation becomes more prevalent, it may become more difficult for us to voluntarily license our patents.\nWe believe that the more prevalent patent enforcement actions become, the more difficult it will be for us to voluntarily license our patents. As a result, we may need to increase the number of our patent enforcement actions to cause infringing companies to license the patent or pay damages for lost royalties. This may increase the risks associated with an investment in our company.\nWe are highly dependent on our Chief Executive Officer and the loss of him could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Further, we may not be able to attract qualified officers to replace him or other key management personnel necessary to grow our business.\nWe are highly dependent on Robert H. Lorsch, our Chief Executive Officer, and the loss of him could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We do maintain key man insurance policies on him. If we lose Mr. Lorsch, we may not be able to attract qualified officers to replace him or other key management personnel necessary to grow our business.\nFurther, we must continue to hire experienced managers to continue to grow our business. As a company with limited operating history, we may have difficulty attracting and retaining new individuals. If we are not successful in attracting management, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our business, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur management will continue to be required to devote substantial time to comply with public company regulations.\nAs a public company, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses in the process of complying with public company regulations. In addition, our management personnel is required to devote substantial time to comply with such regulations, which can be time consuming and may divert time from sales and other activities.\nWe face substantial competition.\nWhile we believe that our MyMedicalRecords products serve a unique niche in the marketplace, other companies offer similar services that compete for subscriber and healthcare professionals' enrollment from the same patient and physician population, and could compete more directly with us by developing processes and technology functionally similar to those that form our MyMedicalRecords products. MMRPro competes with scanning services that market their services to doctors seeking to convert their historical paper records into electronic files, as well as EMR systems. MMRPro also competes with EMR systems that offer doctors the opportunity to make their entire office paperless. Most of these competitors are larger, more deeply funded companies. To the extent they have more success in obtaining market share and customer acceptance of their products, it could have a negative effect on our ability to grow our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur growth will depend on our ability to develop our brand and any failure to do so could limit our business prospects, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe believe that establishing a strong brand will be critical to achieving widespread acceptance and adoption of our products and services. Promoting and positioning our brand will depend largely on the success of our marketing efforts, distribution channels and ability to provide high quality service. Establishing a significant brand presence for an online company often requires substantial marketing investment, and many \"dot.com\" companies have failed to generate the necessary adoption rates even after such a process. Brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenues, and even if they do, any increased revenues may not offset the expenses we incur in building the MyMedicalRecords brand. If we are not successful in building the MyMedicalRecords brand, it could limit our business prospects, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe handling of medical records is highly regulated. Not only could we be subject to substantial liability for mishandling records if we fail to comply with applicable requirements or if third-parties gain unauthorized access to records or servers but our products may need constant revisions or modifications to comply with an increasingly complex regulatory regime.\nThe proper handling of health information, what is included not only in a patient's medical record but potentially elsewhere within the healthcare provider's organization is subject to extensive state and federal regulations and legal requirements, and we anticipate incurring significant costs to keep informed of and in compliance with such regulations and requirements. The volume and complexity of the regulations is daunting, many have changed substantially in recent years, and all are subject to the uncertainties of interpretation.\nWe recognize the critical nature of managing an individual's health information requires that our products and advances be implemented with the utmost care to protect the privacy and confidentiality of our customers' data. HIPAA requires covered entities to protect the privacy and confidentiality of the protected health information, or PHI, of their patients and customers. Although we are not a covered entity (as that term is defined in HIPAA), we consider it important to take into account the Privacy and Security Standards and other requirements of HIPAA when implementing our products and services and believe that we meet and/or exceed current HIPAA standards.\nThe HITECH Act, expanded HIPAA's reach beyond that of just covered entities. Now, business associates, defined as entities that perform a function, activity, or service on behalf of a covered entity and that require use of or access to the PHI of the covered entity, as well as vendors of PHRs that use or access PHI, must also comply with the HIPAA's Security Standards and many of HIPAA's Privacy Standards. One of the key obligations under HITECH is the requirement to notify individuals when there has been (or there is a strong possibility of) a breach of the individual's PHI.\nFurther, our products and services may become subject to greater regulation, particularly at the federal level. We may have to reduce, enhance or remove certain offerings to comply with new regulatory standards. If we are not able to effectively modify our product and service offerings to adapt to stricter standards, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our business and our results of operations and financial condition.\nBecause of the types of agreements that we enter into with our customers for our products, there is a significant time lag between the date of the agreement or license and product launch and revenue generation, which may be significant.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we enter into agreements with certain customers that typically provide for customization of our product. The degree of customization can vary from simple modifications required to co-brand to highly tailored product modifications, which require significant development efforts on our part. Because these customer arrangements typically do not provide for payment of revenues until product launch, there is often a time lag between the date we enter into an agreement or license with a particular customer and when we begin generating revenues. This time lag can be significant in some cases a year or longer especially when there is a high degree of customization or translation involved requiring extensive product development efforts. Thus, even if we are successful in negotiating agreements and licenses with many customers to co-brand or private label our products for such customers, because of the nature of our arrangements with our customers, there is a risk that it may be some time before we generate revenues from such arrangements, if at all.\nOur executive officers and directors may have interests that are different from, or in addition to, those of our stockholders generally.\nOur executive officers and directors may have interests that are different from, or are in addition to, those of our stockholders generally. These interests include having debt with a balance of $1,281,852 at December 31, 2014 secured by a security interest in substantially all of our assets, the provision and continuation of indemnification and insurance arrangements for our directors, as well as certain other interests described elsewhere in this report. Notably, our current President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Robert H. Lorsch, may be deemed to beneficially control a total of 13% of our voting capital stock, as of December 31, 2014, including shares issuable upon exercise of options and warrants held by Mr. Lorsch and The RHL Group. Because of his high percentage of beneficial ownership, Mr. Lorsch may be able to control matters requiring the vote of stockholders, including the election of our board of directors and certain other significant corporate actions. This control could delay, defer or prevent others from initiating a potential merger, takeover or other change in our control, even if these actions would benefit our other stockholders and us. This control could adversely affect the voting and other rights of our stockholders and could depress the market price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price is expected to continue to be volatile, and the market price of our common stock may drop further.\nThe market price of our common stock could continue to be subject to significant fluctuations. Moreover, the stock markets in general have experienced substantial volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of individual companies. These broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, stockholders have often instituted class action securities litigation against those companies. Such litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could significantly harm our operating results, financial condition, profitability and/or reputation.\nWe do not expect to pay cash dividends, and accordingly, stockholders must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment.\nWe anticipate that we will retain our earnings, if any, for future growth and therefore do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the future. As a result, only appreciation of the price of our common stock will provide a return to stockholders. Investors seeking cash dividends should not invest in our common stock.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and applicable Delaware law may prevent or discourage third parties or our stockholders from attempting to replace our management or influence significant decisions.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company or our management, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders. These provisions include:\nDividing our Board of Directors into three classes serving staggered three-year terms;\nAuthorizing our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval;\nProhibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors;\nProhibiting stockholder actions by written consent;\nLimiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders;\nProhibiting our stockholders from making certain changes to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws except with 66.7% stockholder approval; and\nRequiring advance notice for raising business matters or nominating directors at stockholders' meetings.\nWe are also subject to provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law that, in general, prohibits any business combination with a beneficial owner of 15% or more of our common stock for three years unless the holder's acquisition of our stock was approved in advance by our Board of Directors. Together, these charter and statutory provisions could make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nThere is currently a limited trading market for our common stock, which may limit our stockholders' ability to sell shares of our stock.\nOur common stock is currently quoted on the over-the-counter bulletin board, or OTC:QB. Although our common stock has shown to have a healthy trading volume, due to the limitations of the over the counter market, and the penny stock regulations described below, our investors may not be able to sell their shares due to the inherent limitations of such trading market.\nWe are subject to penny stock regulations and restrictions, which could make it difficult for stockholders to sell their shares of our stock.\nSEC regulations generally define \"penny stocks\" as equity securities that have a market price of less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exemptions. We do not fall within any exemptions from the \"penny stock\" definition and are subject to Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act, which regulations are commonly referred to as the \"Penny Stock Rules.\" The Penny Stock Rules impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers prior to selling penny stocks, which may make it burdensome to conduct transactions in our shares. Accordingly, it may be difficult to sell shares of our stock, and because it may be difficult to find quotations for shares of our stock, it may be impossible to accurately price an investment in our shares. In addition to the Penny Stock Rules, we are unable to utilize the safe harbor provisions of the Forward Looking Statements sections of the Exchange Act. There can be no assurance that our common stock will qualify for an exemption from the Penny Stock Rules in the future. In any event, we are subject to Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act, which gives the SEC the authority to restrict any person from participating in a distribution of a penny stock if the SEC determines that such a restriction would be in the public interest.\nThe Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, sales practice requirements may also limit a stockholder's ability to buy and sell our stock.\nIn addition to the Penny Stock Rules described above, FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer's financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market for our shares.\nA significant amount of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock are restricted securities and may not be freely resold to the public. When the restriction on any or all of these shares is lifted, and the shares are sold in the open market, the price of our common stock could be adversely affected through dilution of existing shares.\nA significant amount of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock are \"restricted securities\" as defined under Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and may only be sold pursuant to an effective registration statement or an exemption from registration, if available. Although Rule 144 may not be immediately available to permit resales of such shares, once available, and given the number of shares that would no longer be restricted, sales of shares by our shareholders, whether pursuant to Rule 144 or otherwise, could have an immediate negative effect upon the price of our common stock.\nWhen we issue additional shares in the future, it will likely result in the dilution of our existing stockholders.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 1,250,000,000 shares of common stock with a $0.001 par value and 5,000,000 preferred shares with a par value of $0.001. As of December 31, 2014, 774,417,739 common shares were issued and outstanding and no shares of preferred stock were issued and outstanding. If we issue any additional shares, such issuance will cause a reduction in the proportionate ownership and voting power of all current stockholders. Further, such issuance may result in a change of control of our corporation.\nMoreover, in the past, we issued warrants and options to acquire shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2014, we had warrants, options and convertible notes to purchase an aggregate of 191,965,338 shares of our common stock. In addition, the issuance of any shares for acquisition, licensing or financing efforts, upon conversion of any preferred stock or exercise of warrants and options, pursuant to our equity compensation plans, or otherwise may result in a reduction of the book value and market price of the outstanding shares of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 90594, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "MMRF"}
