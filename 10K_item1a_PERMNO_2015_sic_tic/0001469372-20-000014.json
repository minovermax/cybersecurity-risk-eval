Risk Factors\nThe Success of Our Business Depends on Affiliation Fees We Receive Under Our Affiliation Agreements, the Loss of Which or Renewal of Which on Less Favorable Terms May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.\nOur success is dependent upon the existence and terms of our agreements with Distributors. Existing affiliation agreements of our programming networks expire at various dates. We cannot provide assurances that we will be able to renew these affiliation agreements or obtain terms as attractive as our existing agreements in the event of a renewal.\nAffiliation fees constitute a significant majority of our revenues. Changes in affiliation fee revenues generally result from a combination of changes in rates and/or changes in subscriber counts. Reductions in the license fees that we receive per subscriber or in the number of subscribers for which we are paid, including as a result of a loss of or reduction in carriage of our programming networks, would adversely affect our affiliation fee revenue. For example, our affiliation fee revenue declined $8.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 driven by an acceleration of subscriber losses in the period. Subject to the terms of our affiliation agreements, Distributors may introduce, market and/or modify tiers of programming networks that could impact the number of subscribers that receive our programming networks, including tiers of programming that may exclude our networks. Any loss or reduction in carriage would also decrease the potential audience for our programming, which may adversely affect our advertising revenues. See \u201c- If the Rate of Decline in the Number of Subscribers to Traditional MVPDs Services Increases or These Subscribers Shift to Other Services or Bundles That Do Not Include the Company\u2019s Programming Networks, There May Be a Material Negative Effect on the Company\u2019s Affiliation Revenues.\u201d\nOur affiliation agreements generally require us to meet certain content criteria, such as minimum thresholds for professional event telecasts throughout the calendar year on our networks. If we do not meet these criteria, remedies may be available to our Distributors, such as fee reductions, rebates or refunds and/or termination of these agreements in some cases. For example, we accrued approximately $2 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 for possible affiliate rebates.\nIn addition, under certain circumstances, an existing affiliation agreement may expire and we and the Distributor may not have finalized negotiations of either a renewal of that agreement or a new agreement for certain periods of time. In certain of these circumstances, Distributors may continue to carry the service(s) until the execution of definitive renewal or replacement agreements (or until we or the Distributor determine that carriage should cease).\nOccasionally we may have disputes with Distributors over the terms of our affiliation agreements. If not resolved through business discussions, such disputes could result in litigation and/or actual or threatened termination of an existing agreement.\nOur business is dependent upon affiliation relationships with a limited number of Distributors. The loss of any of our significant Distributors, the failure to renew on terms as attractive as our existing agreements (or to do so in a timely manner) or disputes with our counterparties relating to the interpretation of their agreements with us could materially negatively affect our business and results of operations. See \u201c- Given That We Depend on a Limited Number of Distributors for a Significant Portion of Our Revenues, Further Industry Consolidation Could Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of Operations.\u201d\nGiven That We Depend on a Limited Number of Distributors for a Significant Portion of Our Revenues, Further Industry Consolidation Could Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of Operations.\nThe pay television industry is highly concentrated, with a relatively small number of Distributors serving a significant percentage of pay television subscribers that receive our programming networks, thereby affording the largest Distributors significant leverage in their relationship with programming networks, including us. Substantially all of our affiliation fee revenue comes from our top five Distributors. Further consolidation in the industry could reduce the number of Distributors available to distribute our programming networks and increase the negotiating leverage of certain Distributors, which could adversely affect our revenue. In some cases, if a Distributor is acquired, the affiliation agreement of the acquiring Distributor will govern following the acquisition. In those circumstances, the acquisition of a Distributor that is a party to one or more affiliation agreements with us on terms that are more favorable to us than that of the acquirer could have a material negative impact on our business and results of operations. See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur Operations and Operating Results Have Been, and Continue to be, Impacted by the COVID-19 Pandemic and Actions Taken in Response.\nAn outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, in December 2019 subsequently became a global pandemic. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020, the 2019-20 NBA and NHL seasons were suspended. On May 26, 2020, the NHL announced that the 2019-20 regular season was complete and that certain teams would return to play post-season games, including the Rangers and the Islanders, but not the Devils or the Sabres. On June 4, 2020, the NBA announced that certain teams would return to play for the purpose of determining post-season participation and seeding, but not the Knicks. While each of our teams had played a substantial portion of their 2019-20 NHL and NBA regular season games, the suspension of the seasons resulted in 66 fewer regular season games aired on our networks during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 as compared with the prior year. The NHL and NBA plans for resumption of play would have each league ending its respective post-season in October 2020, which would delay the start of each league's 2020-21 season.\nThe Rangers and the Islanders resumed play for the 2019-20 season in late July 2020. As of August 13, 2020, the Islanders, but not the Rangers, are still competing in the post-season games. No assurances can be made as to whether the 2019-20 NHL season will be completed, the number of games that will be available to us for exhibition as a result and if and when the 2020-21 NHL and NBA seasons will begin and the resulting live sports games featuring our teams will become available to the Company. The impact of the suspended NBA and NHL seasons, and any other continuing effects of COVID-19 on our business operations (such as general economic conditions and impacts on the advertising marketplace), may result in a decrease in our revenues, and if the 2020-21 seasons are limited or there are additional suspensions which continue for an extended period, such a decrease would be substantial.\nOur business depends on the appeal of our live programming to viewing subscribers of our networks and to our advertisers. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the suspension of the 2019-20 seasons, we have experienced a material decrease in advertising revenue. Our advertising revenue declined $7.2 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 as compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019. Although we expect an increase in advertising revenues in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2020 relating to the resumption of play for the Rangers and Islanders, thereafter we expect a decrease in advertising revenue to continue for periods during which we would otherwise have had live NBA and NHL games for as long as live sports games are not aired on our networks and may also continue after live NBA and NHL sports games resume. Although the absence of live sports games also results in a decrease in certain expenses, including variable production expenses, advertising sales commissions, and rights fees, if the duration of the impacts from COVID-19 continue for an extended period of time, we would not be able to fully offset the decline in revenues, which would adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow.\nThe Company has experienced a decrease in subscribers to our programming networks in each of the last several fiscal years, which has adversely affected our operating results. If the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impede economic activity and/or the 2020-21 NBA or NHL seasons are adversely impacted, the pandemic could lead to a further decline or accelerate the rate of decline in the number of subscribers to our programming networks. The loss of additional subscribers, if material, would have long-term adverse effects on our business and results of operations.\nOur business is dependent upon affiliation relationships with a limited number of Distributors and their continued compliance with their contractual obligations. If any of those Distributors failed to comply with their contractual obligations, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, it could have an adverse effect on our revenues. See \u201c-The Success of Our Business Depends on Affiliation Fees We Receive Under Our Affiliation Agreements, the Loss of Which or Renewal of Which on Less Favorable Terms May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.\u201d In addition, our affiliation agreements generally require us to meet certain content criteria, such as minimum thresholds for professional event telecasts throughout the calendar year on our networks. If we do not meet these criteria, remedies may be available to our Distributors, such as fee reductions, rebates or refunds and/or termination of these agreements in some cases. In addition, the absence of live sports games could impact our ability to renew expiring agreements on terms as attractive as our existing terms or at all. In addition, government actions or regulations applicable to our business or our Distributors in response to COVID-19 could have an adverse effect on our revenues. See \u201c-The Success of Our Business Depends on Affiliation Fees We Receive Under Our Affiliation Agreements, the Loss of Which or Renewal of Which on Less Favorable Terms May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations\u201d and \u201c-We Are Subject to Governmental Regulation, Which Can Change, and Any Failure to Comply With These Regulations May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.\u201d\nOperationally, most of our employees are working remotely, and we have restricted our production activities and business travel. If significant portions of our workforce, including key personnel, are unable to work or work effectively because of illness, government actions or other restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, any adverse impact of the pandemic on our businesses could be exacerbated.\nWe cannot reasonably estimate the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the extent of any adverse impacts on our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, which will depend on, among other things, the duration and spread of COVID-19, the impact of government and league actions that have been and continue to be taken in response, and the effectiveness of actions taken to contain or mitigate the pandemic and economic conditions.\nOur Business Faces Intense and Wide-Ranging Competition Which May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.\nOur business competes, in certain respects and to varying degrees, for viewers and advertisers with other programming networks, pay-per-view, video-on-demand, online streaming or on-demand services and other content offered by Distributors and others. Additional companies, some with significant financial resources, continue to enter or are seeking to enter the video distribution market either by offering OTT streaming services or selling devices that aggregate viewing of various OTT services, which continues to put pressure on an already competitive landscape. We also compete for viewers and advertisers with content offered over the Internet, social media and social networking platforms, mobile media, radio, motion picture, home video and other sources of information and entertainment and advertising services. Important competitive factors are the prices we charge for our programming networks, the quantity, quality (in particular, the performance of the sports teams whose media rights we control), the variety of the programming offered on our networks, and the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.\nNew or existing programming networks that are owned by or affiliated with broadcast networks such as NBC, ABC, CBS or Fox may have a competitive advantage over our networks in obtaining distribution through the \u201cbundling\u201d of agreements to carry those programming networks with the agreement giving the Distributor the right to carry a broadcast station owned by or affiliated with the network. For example, regional sports networks affiliated with broadcast networks are carried by certain Distributors that do not currently carry our networks.\nThe extent to which competitive programming, including NBA and NHL games, are available on other programming networks and distribution platforms can adversely affect our competitive position.\nThe competitive environment in which our business operates may also be affected by technological developments. It is difficult to predict the future effect of technology on many of the factors affecting our competitive position.\nWith respect to advertising services, factors affecting the degree and extent of competition include prices, reach and audience demographics, among others. Some of our competitors are large companies that have greater financial resources available to them than we do which could impact our viewership and the resulting advertising revenues.\nWe May Not Be Able to Adapt to New Content Distribution Platforms and to Changes in Consumer Behavior Resulting From Emerging Technologies, Which May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.\nWe must successfully adapt to technological advances in our industry and the manner in which consumers watch sporting events, including the emergence of alternative distribution platforms. Our ability to exploit new distribution platforms and viewing technologies may affect our ability to maintain and/or grow our business. Emerging forms of content distribution provide different economic models and compete with current distribution methods in ways that are not entirely predictable. Such competition has reduced and could continue to reduce demand for our programming networks or for the offerings of our Distributors and, in turn, reduce our revenue from these sources. Content providers (such as certain broadcast and cable networks) and new content developers, Distributors and syndicators are distributing programming directly to consumers on an OTT basis. In addition to existing direct-to-consumer streaming services such as Amazon Prime, Hulu and Netflix, in the last fiscal year, several new direct-to-consumer streaming services such as Apple TV+, Disney+, HBO Max, Peacock and Quibi have launched and additional services may launch. Such direct-to-consumer OTT distribution of content has contributed to consumers eliminating or downgrading their pay television subscription, which results in certain consumers not receiving our programming networks. If we are unable to offset this loss of subscribers through incremental carriage of our networks or rate increases, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected. Gaming, television and other console and device manufacturers, Distributors and others, such as Microsoft\u2019s Xbox, Apple and Roku, are offering and/or developing technology to offer video programming, including in some cases, various OTT platforms. Such changes have and may continue to impact the revenues we are able to generate from our traditional distribution methods, by decreasing the viewership of our programming networks and/or by making advertising on our programming networks less valuable to advertisers.\nIn order to respond to these developments, we may need to implement changes to our business models and strategies and there can be no assurance that any such changes will prove to be successful or that the business models and strategies we develop will be as profitable as our current business models and strategies. If we fail to adapt to emerging technologies, our appeal to Distributors and our targeted audiences might decline and there could be a material negative effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, advertising revenues could be significantly impacted by emerging technologies, given that advertising sales are dependent on audience measurement provided by third parties, and the results of audience measurement techniques can vary independent of the size of the audience for a variety of reasons, including difficulties related to the traditional statistical sampling methods, ability to measure new distribution platforms and viewing technologies, and the shifting of the marketplace to the use of measurement of different viewer behaviors, such as delayed viewing. In addition, multiplatform campaign verification is in its infancy, and viewership on tablets, smart phones and other digital devices, which continues to grow, is presently not measured by any one consistently applied method. Moreover, devices that allow users to fast forward or skip programming, including commercials, are causing changes in consumer behavior that may affect the desirability of our programming networks to advertisers. These variations and changes could have a significant effect on advertising revenues.\nIf the Rate of Decline in the Number of Subscribers to Traditional MVPDs Services Increases or These Subscribers Shift to Other Services or Bundles That Do Not Include the Company\u2019s Programming Networks, There May Be a Material Negative Effect on the Company\u2019s Affiliation Revenues.\nDuring the last few years, the number of subscribers to traditional MVPDs services in the U.S. has been declining, and the rate of decline has increased in recent periods. In addition, Distributors have introduced, marketed and/or modified tiers or bundles of programming that have impacted the number of subscribers that receive our programming networks, including tiers or bundles of programming that exclude our programming networks. As a result of these factors, the Company has experienced a decrease in subscribers in each of the last several fiscal years, which has adversely affected our operating results.\nIf traditional MVPDs service offerings are not attractive to consumers due to pricing, increased competition from OTT services, increased dissatisfaction with the quality of traditional MVPDs services, poor economic conditions or other factors, more consumers may (i) cancel their traditional MVPDs service subscriptions or choose not to subscribe to traditional MVPDs services, (ii) elect to instead subscribe to OTT services, which in some cases may be offered at a lower price-point and may not include our programming networks or (iii) elect to subscribe to smaller bundles of programming which may not include our programming networks. If the rate of decline in the number of traditional MVPDs service subscribers increases or if subscribers shift to OTT services or smaller bundles of programming that do not include the Company\u2019s programming networks, this may have a material negative effect on the Company\u2019s revenues. See \u201c- Our Operations and Operating Results Have Been, and Continue to be, Impacted by the COVID-19 Pandemic and Actions Taken in Response.\u201d\nWe Derive Substantial Revenues From the Sale of Advertising Time and Those Revenues Are Subject to a Number of Factors, Many of Which Are Beyond Our Control.\nAdvertising revenues depend on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, such as: (i) the health of the economy in the markets our businesses serve and in the nation as a whole; (ii) general economic trends in the advertising industry; (iii) team performance; (iv) whether live sports games are being played; (v) the popularity of our programming; (vi) the activities of our competitors, including increased competition from other forms of advertising-based media (such as Internet, mobile media, other programming networks, radio and print media); (vii) shifts in consumer viewing patterns, including consumers watching more ad-free content, non-traditional and shorter-form video content online, and the increased use of DVRs to skip advertisements; (viii) declining consumer tolerance for commercial interruptions; (ix) an increasing shift of advertising expenditures to digital and mobile offerings; (x) increasing audience fragmentation caused by increased availability of alternative forms of leisure and entertainment activities, such as social networking platforms and video games; (xi) consumer budgeting and buying patterns; (xii) the extent of the distribution of our networks; and (xiii) changes in the audience demographic for our programming. The 2019-20 NBA and NHL season suspensions resulted in 66 fewer regular season games aired on our networks during the year ended June 30, 2020 compared with the prior year, which had an adverse impact on our advertising revenues. A decline in the economic prospects of advertisers or the economy in general could alter current or prospective advertisers\u2019 spending priorities, which could cause our revenues and operating results to decline significantly in any given period. Even in the absence of a general recession or downturn in the economy, an individual business sector that tends to spend more on advertising than other sectors might be forced to reduce its advertising expenditures if that sector experiences a downturn. In such case, a reduction in advertising expenditures by such a sector may adversely affect our revenues. See \u201c- Our Operations and Operating Results Have Been, and Continue to be, Impacted by the COVID-19 Pandemic and Actions Taken in Response.\u201d\nThe pricing and volume of advertising may be affected by shifts in spending away from more traditional media toward online and mobile offerings or towards new ways of purchasing advertising, such as through automated purchasing, dynamic advertising insertion, third parties selling local advertising spots and advertising exchanges, some or all of which may not be as advantageous to the Company as current advertising methods.\nIn addition, we cannot ensure that our programming will achieve favorable ratings. Our ratings depend partly upon unpredictable and volatile factors, many of which are beyond our control, such as team performance, whether live sports games are being played, viewer preferences, the level of distribution of our programming, competing programming and the availability of other entertainment options. A shift in viewer preferences could cause our advertising revenues to decline as a result of changes to the ratings for our programming and materially negatively affect our business and results of operations. As noted below, MSGE has the exclusive right and obligation to sell our advertising availabilities on our behalf for a commission and, as a result, our advertising revenues are dependent to a material extent on MSGE\u2019s sales performance, subject to certain termination rights. See \u201c- We Rely on MSGS\u2019 and MSGE\u2019s Performance Under Various Agreements.\u201d\nOur Media Rights Agreements With Various Professional Sports Teams Have Varying Durations and Terms and We May Be Unable to Renew Those Agreements on Acceptable Terms or Such Rights May Be Lost for Other Reasons.\nOur business is dependent upon media rights agreements with professional sports teams. Upon expiration, we may seek renewal of these agreements and, if we do, we may be outbid by competing programming networks or others for these agreements or the renewal costs could substantially exceed our costs under the current agreements. Even if we are able to renew such agreements, the Company\u2019s results could be adversely affected if escalations in sports programming rights costs are unmatched by increases in affiliation and advertising revenues. In addition, one or more of these teams may seek to establish their own programming network or join one of our competitor\u2019s networks and, in certain circumstances, we may not have an opportunity to bid for the media rights. Moreover, the value of these agreements may also be affected by various league decisions and/or league agreements that we may not be able to control, including a decision to alter the number of games played during a season. The value of these media rights can also be affected, or we could lose such rights entirely, if a team is liquidated, undergoes reorganization in bankruptcy or relocates to an area where it is not possible or commercially feasible for us to continue to distribute games. Any loss or diminution in the value of rights could impact the extent of the sports coverage offered by us and could materially negatively affect our business and results of operations. In addition, our affiliation agreements generally include certain remedies in the event our networks fail to include a minimum number of professional event telecasts, and, accordingly, any loss of rights could materially negatively affect our business and results of operations. See \u201c- The Success of Our Business Depends on Affiliation Fees We Receive Under Our Affiliation Agreements, the Loss of Which or Renewal of Which on Less Favorable Terms May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.\u201d\nThe Actions of the NBA and NHL May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.\nThe governing bodies of the NBA and the NHL have imposed, and may impose in the future, various rules, regulations, guidelines, bulletins, directives, policies and agreements (collectively, \u201cLeague Rules\u201d), which could have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations. For example, each league imposes rules that define the territories in which we may distribute games of the teams in the applicable league. Changes to these rules or other League Rules, or the adoption of new League Rules, could have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations. See \u201c- Organized Labor Matters May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.\u201d\nIn addition, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related government actions, decisions made by the NBA and NHL have affected, and in the future may continue to affect, our ability to produce and distribute live sports games on our networks. See \u201c- Our Operations and Operating Results Have Been, and Continue to be, Impacted by the COVID-19 Pandemic and Actions Taken in Response.\u201d\nOur Business is Substantially Dependent on the Popularity of the NBA and NHL Teams Whose Media Rights We Control.\nOur business has historically been, and we expect will continue to be, dependent on the popularity of the NBA and NHL teams whose local media rights we control and, in varying degrees, those teams achieving on-court and on-ice success, which can generate fan enthusiasm, resulting in increased viewership and advertising revenues. Furthermore, success in the regular season may qualify a team for participation in the post-season, which generates increased excitement and interest in the teams, which can improve viewership and advertising revenues. Some of our teams have not participated in the post-season for an extended period of time. For example, the Knicks have not qualified for the post-season since the 2012-13 NBA season and the Sabres have not qualified for the post-season since the 2010-11 NHL season. In addition, if a team declines in popularity or fails to generate fan enthusiasm, this may negatively impact the terms on which our affiliate agreements are renewed. There can be no assurance that any sports team will generate fan enthusiasm or compete in post-season play and the failure to do so could result in a material negative effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur Business Depends on the Appeal of Our Programming, Which May Be Unpredictable, and Increased Programming Costs May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.\nOur business depends, in part, upon viewer preferences and audience acceptance of the programming on our networks. These factors are often unpredictable and subject to influences that are beyond our control, such as the quality and appeal of competing programming, general economic conditions and the availability of other entertainment options. We may not be able to successfully predict interest in proposed new programming and viewer preferences could cause new programming not to be successful or cause our existing programming to decline in popularity. If our programming does not gain or maintain the level of audience acceptance we, our advertisers or Distributors expect, it could negatively affect advertising or affiliation fee revenues. An increase in our costs associated with programming, including original programming, may materially negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nWe May Be Unable to Obtain Programming From Third Parties on Reasonable Terms, Which Could Lead to Higher Costs.\nWe rely on third parties for sports and other programming for our networks. We compete with other providers of programming to acquire the rights to distribute such programming. If we fail to continue to obtain sports and other programming for our networks on reasonable terms for any reason, including as a result of competition, we could be forced to incur additional costs to acquire such programming or look for alternative programming, which may have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe Face Continually Evolving Cybersecurity and Similar Risks, Which Could Result in Loss, Disclosure, Theft, Destruction or Misappropriation of, or Access to, Our Confidential Information and Cause Disruption of Our Business, Damage to Our Brands and Reputation, Legal Exposure and Financial Losses.\nThrough our operations, we may collect, and store, including by electronic means, certain personal and other sensitive information that is provided to us, including through registration on our websites, mobile applications or otherwise in communication or interaction with us. These activities require the use of online services and centralized data storage, including through third-party service providers. Data maintained in electronic form is subject to the risk of security incidents, including breach, compromise, intrusion, tampering, theft, misappropriation or other malicious activity. Further, hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including \u201cbugs\u201d and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of such systems. Our ability to safeguard such personal and other sensitive information, including information regarding the Company and our Distributors, advertisers and employees, is important to our business. We take these matters seriously and take significant steps to protect our stored information, including the implementation of systems and processes to thwart malicious activity. These protections are\ncostly and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. In addition, data privacy laws may require monitoring of, and changes to, our practices related to the collection, use, disclosure and storage of personal information. Despite our efforts, the risks of a security incident cannot be entirely eliminated and our information technology and other systems that maintain and transmit consumer, Distributor, advertiser, Company, employee and other confidential information may be compromised due to employee error or other action, computer malware or ransomware, viruses, hacking and phishing attacks, or otherwise. Such compromise could affect the security of information on our network, or that of a third-party service provider, including MSGE to which we outsource information technology support. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, vendors or users to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to data and systems. As a result, such sensitive and/or confidential information may be lost, disclosed, accessed or taken without authorization. See \u201c-We Rely on MSGS\u2019 and MSGE\u2019s Performance Under Various Agreements\u201d for a discussion of services MSGE performs on our behalf.\nIf we experience a security incident, our ability to conduct business may be interrupted or impaired, we may incur damage to our systems, we may lose profitable opportunities or the value of those opportunities may be diminished and we may lose revenue as a result of unlicensed use of our intellectual property. The Company may be required to incur significant expenses in order to address any security issues that arise, and we may not have insurance coverage for any or all of such expenses. Further, an actual or perceived security incident, such as penetration of our or our third-party vendors\u2019 networks, affecting personal or other sensitive information could subject us to business and litigation risk, including costs associated with such misappropriation or misuse, and damage our reputation, including with Distributors, viewers and advertisers, which could have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe FCC\u2019s Changes to the Spectrum Used by Satellites to Deliver Programming Networks to Distributors, As Well As The Unavailability of Satellites, Facilities, Systems and/or Software Upon Which We Rely, May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.\nWe use third-party satellites and other systems to transmit our programming services to our Distributors. We use distribution facilities that include uplinks, communications, satellites, and downlinks. Notwithstanding certain back-up and redundant systems and facilities maintained by our third-party providers, transmissions or quality of transmissions may be disrupted, including as a result of events that impair uplinks, downlinks or transmission facilities or the impairment of satellite or terrestrial facilities. In addition, the FCC has reallocated some of the spectrum on which these satellites operate for other uses, and satellite operators will begin transitioning to use the resulting smaller amount of spectrum as soon as late 2020. This change in spectrum will cause our third-party providers to change the way they transmit our programming, including by using different satellites and potentially compressing the video, which could affect quality. It will also require many of our Distributors to acquire new equipment, or modify their current equipment, to receive our programming networks. If they fail to do so, or if there are any other disruptions in the transition process including by satellite operators transitioning to new transmission systems, our Distributors and their subscribers may no longer receive our programming. Part of the spectrum on which video programming networks were previously delivered will be auctioned to wireless providers, who will offer 5G services that could cause interference with the delivery of our programming.\nCurrently, there are a limited number of communications satellites, which are operated by third parties, available for the transmission of programming, and their continued availability may depend upon a variety of factors including business conditions, technology issues, further changes in law or regulation that may limit the spectrum that these satellites and facilities depend upon to operate and our ability to access such satellites on reasonable terms. In addition, we are party to an agreement with AMC Networks Inc. (\u201cAMC Networks\u201d), pursuant to which AMC Networks provides us with certain origination, master control and technical services which are necessary to distribute our programming networks. If a disruption occurs, we may not be able to secure alternate distribution facilities in a timely manner. In addition, we rely upon various internal and third-party systems or software in the operation of our business, including, with respect to database, human resource management, and financial systems. From time to time, certain of these arrangements may not be covered by long-term agreements. In addition, such distribution facilities and/or internal or third-party services, systems or software could be adversely impacted by cybersecurity threats including unauthorized breaches. See \u201c- We Face Continually Evolving Cybersecurity and Similar Risks, Which Could Result in Loss, Disclosure, Theft, Destruction or Misappropriation of, or Access to, Our Confidential Information and Cause Disruption of Our Business, Damage to Our Brands and Reputation, Legal Exposure and Financial Losses.\u201d The failure or unavailability of distribution facilities or these internal and third-party services, systems or software, depending upon its severity and duration, could have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations.\nTheft of Our Intellectual Property May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.\nThe success of our business depends in part on our ability to maintain and monetize our intellectual property rights to our programming, technologies, digital content and other content that is material to our business. Theft of our intellectual property, including content, could have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations because it may reduce the\nrevenue that we are able to receive from the legitimate sale and distribution of our content, undermine lawful distribution channels, limit our ability to control the marketing of our content and inhibit our ability to recoup or profit from the costs incurred to create such content. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or protect our trade secrets. Any litigation of this nature, regardless of the outcome, could cause us to incur significant costs.\nWe May Become Subject to Infringement or Other Claims Relating to Our Content or Technology.\nFrom time to time, third parties may assert against us alleged intellectual property (e.g., copyright, trademark and patent) or other claims relating to our programming, technologies, digital content or other content, some of which may be material to our business. In addition, our programming could subject us to claims of defamation or similar types of allegations. Any such claims, regardless of their merit, could cause us to incur significant costs that could harm our results of operations. We may not be indemnified against, or have insurance coverage for, claims or costs of these types. In addition, if we are unable to continue use of certain intellectual property rights, our business and results of operations could be materially negatively impacted.\nOur Business Has Been Adversely Impacted and May, in the Future, Be Materially Adversely Impacted by an Economic Downturn and Financial Instability.\nOur business depends upon the ability and willingness of consumers and businesses to subscribe to a package of programming that includes our networks. In addition, our business is dependent upon affiliation fee and advertising revenues, which are both sensitive to general economic conditions and consumer buying patterns. See \u201c- We Derive Substantial Revenues From the Sale of Advertising Time and Those Revenues Are Subject to a Number of Factors, Many of Which Are Beyond Our Control.\u201d\nAs a result, instability and weakness of the U.S. and global economies, including as a result of disruptions to financial markets, inflation, recession, high unemployment, geopolitical events and other effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the negative effects on consumers\u2019 and businesses\u2019 discretionary spending may materially negatively affect our business and results of operations. See \u201c-Our Operations and Operating Results Have Been, and Continue to be, Impacted by the COVID-19 Pandemic and Actions Taken in Response.\u201d\nWeather or Other Conditions Which Are Outside Our Control May Disrupt Our Programming and May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.\nWeather or other conditions, including natural disasters, acts of terrorism and similar events, which are outside our control may prevent us or our Distributors from providing our programming to customers, may reduce advertising expenditures and may have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations. See \u201c-Our Operations and Operating Results Have Been, and Continue to be, Impacted by the COVID-19 Pandemic and Actions Taken in Response.\u201d\nWe Are Subject to Governmental Regulation, Which Can Change, and Any Failure to Comply With These Regulations May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.\nOur business is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations. Some FCC regulations apply to us directly and other FCC regulations, although imposed on Distributors, affect programming networks indirectly. See \u201cItem 1. Business - Regulation.\u201d Legislative enactments, court actions, and federal regulatory proceedings could materially affect our programming business by modifying the rates, terms, and conditions under which we offer our content or programming networks to Distributors and the public, or otherwise materially affect the range of our activities or strategic business alternatives. We cannot predict the likelihood, results or impact on our business of any such legislative, judicial, or regulatory actions. Furthermore, to the extent that regulations and laws, either presently in force or proposed, hinder or stimulate the growth of Distributors, our business could be affected. The U.S. Congress and the FCC currently have under consideration, and may in the future adopt, amend, or repeal, laws, regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could, directly or indirectly, affect our business. The regulation of Distributors is subject to the political process and has been in constant flux over the past two decades. Further material changes in the law and regulatory requirements may be proposed or adopted in the future. Our business and our results of operations may be materially negatively affected by future legislation, new regulation or deregulation.\nOur business is, and may in the future be, subject to a variety of other laws and regulations, including licensing requirements; working conditions, labor, immigration and employment laws; and data and privacy laws. We are unable to predict the outcome or effects of any of these potential actions or any other legislative or regulatory proposals on our businesses. Any changes to the legal and regulatory framework applicable to any of our services or businesses could have an adverse impact on our businesses and results of operations.\nOur failure to comply with applicable governmental laws and regulations, or to maintain necessary permits or licenses, could have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations.\nOrganized Labor Matters May Have a Material Negative Effect on Our Business and Results of Operations.\nOur business is substantially dependent upon the efforts of unionized workers. As of June 30, 2020, approximately 72% of our workforce is subject to CBAs.\nIn addition, we may be impacted by union relations of the NBA and the NHL. Both the NBA and the NHL have experienced labor difficulties in the past and may have labor issues, such as players\u2019 strikes or management lockouts, in the future. For example, the NBA has experienced labor difficulties, including a lockout during the 1998-99 season, which resulted in a regular season that was shortened from 82 to 50 games, and a lockout during the 2011-12 season, which resulted in a regular season that was shortened from 82 games to 66 games. The current NBA CBA expires after the 2023-24 season, but the NBA has the right to terminate the NBA CBA effective following the 2019-20 season and each of the NBA and players union have the right to terminate the CBA effective following the 2022-23 season. In addition, the NBA currently has the right to terminate the CBA through the end of September due to force majeure as a result of COVID-19. The NHL has also experienced labor difficulties, including a lockout during the 1994-95 NHL season, which resulted in a regular season that was shortened from 84 to 48 games, a lockout beginning in September 2004, which resulted in the cancellation of the entire 2004-05 NHL season, and a lockout during the 2012-13 NHL season, which resulted in a regular season that was shortened from 82 to 48 games. The current NHL CBA was scheduled to expire on September 15, 2022, but the NHL and the players union have recently agreed on terms by which the NHL CBA will be extended through September 15, 2026 (with the possibility of an additional one-year extension in certain circumstances).\nAny labor disputes, such as strikes or lockouts, with the unions with which we have CBAs or by the NBA, NHL or their respective players, could have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations by impacting our ability to produce or present programming.\nWe Have Substantial Indebtedness and Are Highly Leveraged, Which Could Adversely Affect Our Business.\nWe are highly leveraged with a significant amount of debt and we may continue to incur additional debt in the future. For example, in September 2019, we incurred $100 million of debt to finance a cash tender offer for shares of our Class A common stock. As a result of our indebtedness, we are required to make interest and principal payments on our borrowings that are significant in relation to our revenues and cash flows. These payments reduce our earnings and cash available for other potential business purposes. This leverage also exposes us to significant risk by limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business (whether through competitive pressure or otherwise), the cable and telecommunications industries and the economy at large. Although our cash flows could decrease in these scenarios, our required payments in respect of indebtedness would not decrease.\nIn addition, our ability to make payments on, or repay or refinance, such debt, and to fund our operating and capital expenditures, depends largely upon our future operating performance. Our future operating performance, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. Furthermore, our interest expense could increase if interest rates increase because our indebtedness bears interest at floating rates or to the extent we have to refinance existing debt with higher cost debt.\nWe May Require Additional Financing to Fund Our Ongoing Operations and Capital Expenditures, the Availability of Which is Highly Uncertain.\nThe capital and credit markets can experience volatility and disruption. Such markets can exert extreme downward pressure on stock prices and upward pressure on the cost of new debt capital and may severely restrict our ability to access new credit, if needed.\nAlthough we have a $250 million revolving credit facility (the \u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d) (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information), our ability to draw on such facility will depend on our ability to meet certain financial covenants and other conditions. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any such facility in the future or raise any required additional capital or to do so on favorable terms. Depending upon conditions in the financial markets and/or the Company\u2019s financial performance, we may not be able to raise new capital on favorable terms, or at all.\nWe May Pursue Acquisitions and Other Strategic Investments to Complement or Expand Our Business That May Not Be Successful.\nWe may explore opportunities to purchase or invest in other businesses or assets that could complement, enhance or expand our current business or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities, including opportunities that may differ from the Company\u2019s current business. Any transactions that we are able to identify and complete may involve risks, including the\ncommitment of significant capital, the incurrence of indebtedness, the payment of advances, the diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources from our existing business to develop and integrate the acquired or combined business, the inability to successfully integrate such business or assets into our operations, litigation or other claims in connection with acquisitions or against companies we invest in or acquire, our lack of control over joint venture companies and other minority investments, the risk of not achieving the intended results and the exposure to losses if the underlying transactions or ventures are not successful. Any such risks could result in a material negative effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe Are Controlled by the Dolan Family. As a Result of Their Control, the Dolan Family Has the Ability to Prevent or Cause a Change in Control or Approve, Prevent or Influence Certain Actions by the Company.\nWe have two classes of common stock:\n\u2022\nClass A Common Stock, which is entitled to one vote per share and is entitled collectively to elect 25% of our Board of Directors.\n\u2022\nClass B Common Stock, which is entitled to ten votes per share and is entitled collectively to elect the remaining 75% of our Board of Directors.\nAs of July 31, 2020, the Dolan family, including trusts for the benefit of members of the Dolan family (collectively, the \u201cDolan Family Group\u201d), collectively own all of our outstanding Class B Common Stock and approximately 7.2% (inclusive of options exercisable within 60 days of the date hereof) of our outstanding Class A Common Stock, and as a result hold approximately 77.0% of the total voting power of all our outstanding common stock. The members of the Dolan Family Group holding Class B Common Stock have executed a stockholders agreement (the \u201cStockholders Agreement\u201d) that has the effect of causing the voting power of the holders of our Class B Common Stock to be cast as a block with respect to all matters to be voted on by holders of Class B Common Stock. Under the Stockholders Agreement, the shares of Class B Common Stock owned by members of the Dolan Family Group (representing all of the outstanding Class B Common Stock) are to be voted on all matters in accordance with the determination of the Dolan Family Committee, except that the decisions of the Dolan Family Committee are non-binding with respect to the Class B Common Stock owned by certain Dolan family trusts that collectively own 40.5% of the outstanding Class B Common Stock (\u201cExcluded Trusts\u201d). The \u201cDolan Family Committee\u201d consists of Charles F. Dolan and his six children, James L. Dolan, Thomas C. Dolan, Patrick F. Dolan, Kathleen M. Dolan, Deborah A. Dolan-Sweeney, and Marianne Dolan Weber. The Dolan Family Committee generally acts by a majority vote, except that approval of a going-private transaction must be approved by a two-thirds vote and approval of a change-in-control transaction must be approved by not less than all but one vote. The voting members of the Dolan Family Committee are James L. Dolan, Thomas C. Dolan, Kathleen M. Dolan, Deborah A. Dolan-Sweeney, and Marianne Dolan Weber, with each member having one vote other than James L. Dolan, who has two votes. Because James L. Dolan has two votes, he has the ability to block Dolan Family Committee approval of any Company change in control transaction. Shares of Class B Common Stock owned by Excluded Trusts are to be voted on all matters in accordance with the determination of the Excluded Trusts holding a majority of the Class B Common Stock held by all Excluded Trusts, except in the case of a vote on a going-private transaction or a change in control transaction, in which case a vote of trusts holding two-thirds of the Class B Common Stock owned by Excluded Trusts is required.\nThe Dolan Family Group is able to prevent a change in control of our Company and no person interested in acquiring us will be able to do so without obtaining the consent of the Dolan Family Group. The Dolan Family Group, by virtue of their stock ownership, have the power to elect all of our directors subject to election by holders of Class B Common Stock and are able collectively to control stockholder decisions on matters on which holders of all classes of our common stock vote together as a single class. These matters could include the amendment of some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and the approval of fundamental corporate transactions.\nIn addition, the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding shares of the Class B Common Stock, voting separately as a class, is required to approve:\n\u2022\nthe authorization or issuance of any additional shares of Class B Common Stock, and\n\u2022\nany amendment, alteration or repeal of any of the provisions of our certificate of incorporation that adversely affects the powers, preferences or rights of the Class B Common Stock.\nAs a result, the Dolan Family Group also has the power to prevent such issuance or amendment.\nThe Dolan Family Group also controls MSGE, MSGS and AMC Networks.\nWe Have Elected to Be a \u201cControlled Company\u201d for New York Stock Exchange Purposes Which Allows Us Not to Comply With Certain of the Corporate Governance Rules of New York Stock Exchange.\nMembers of the Dolan Family Group have entered into the Stockholders Agreement relating, among other things, to the voting of their shares of our Class B Common Stock. As a result, we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under the corporate governance rules of New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d). Our Board of Directors has elected for the Company to be treated as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under NYSE corporate governance rules and not to comply with the NYSE requirement for a majority independent board of directors and for an independent corporate governance and nominating committee because of our status as a controlled company. Nevertheless, our Board of Directors has elected to comply with the NYSE requirement for an independent compensation committee.\nFuture Stock Sales, Including as a Result of the Exercise of Registration Rights by Certain of Our Stockholders, Could Adversely Affect the Trading Price of Our Class A Common Stock.\nCertain parties have registration rights covering a portion of our shares. We have entered into registration rights agreements with Charles F. Dolan, members of his family, certain Dolan family interests and the Dolan Family Foundation that provide them with \u201cdemand\u201d and \u201cpiggyback\u201d registration rights with respect to approximately 15 million shares of Class A Common Stock, including shares issuable upon conversion of shares of Class B Common Stock. Sales of a substantial number of shares of Class A Common Stock, including sales pursuant to these registration rights agreements, could adversely affect the market price of the Class A Common Stock and could impair our future ability to raise capital through an offering of our equity securities.\nWe Share Certain Key Executives and Directors With MSGE, MSGS and/or AMC Networks, Which Means Those Executives Do Not Devote Their Full Time and Attention to Our Affairs and the Overlap May Give Rise to Conflicts.\nOur Executive Chairman, James L. Dolan, also serves as Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of MSGE and Executive Chairman of MSGS, and our Executive Vice President and General Counsel, Lawrence J. Burian, also serves as the Executive Vice President and General Counsel of MSGS. As a result, not all of our executive officers devote their full time and attention to the Company\u2019s affairs. Our Vice Chairman, Gregg G. Seibert, also serves as the Vice Chairman of MSGE, MSGS and AMC Networks, and our Secretary, Mark C. Cresitello, also serves as Senior Vice President, Associate General Counsel and Secretary of MSGS. In addition, one of our directors, Charles F. Dolan, is the Executive Chairman of AMC Networks. Furthermore, eight members of our Board of Directors (including James L. Dolan) are also directors of MSGE, seven members of our Board of Directors (including James L. Dolan) are also directors of MSGS and six members of our Board of Directors (including James L. Dolan) are also directors of AMC Networks concurrently with their service on our Board of Directors. The overlapping officers and directors may have actual or apparent conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting each company. For example, the potential for a conflict of interest exists when we on the one hand, and MSGE, MSGS or AMC Networks on the other hand, look at certain acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that may be suitable for more than one of the companies. Also, conflicts may arise if there are issues or disputes under the commercial arrangements that exist between MSGE, MSGS or AMC Networks and us. In addition, certain of our directors and officers hold MSGE, MSGS and/or AMC Networks stock, performance stock units, restricted stock units, options, and/or or cash performance awards. These ownership interests could create actual, apparent or potential conflicts of interest when these individuals are faced with decisions that could have different implications for our Company and MSGE, MSGS or AMC Networks. See \u201cCertain Relationships and Potential Conflicts of Interest\u201d in our Proxy Statement filed with the SEC on October 25, 2019 and our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 19, 2020 for a discussion of certain procedures we instituted to help ameliorate such potential conflicts with MSGE, MSGS and/or AMC Networks that may arise.\nOur Overlapping Directors and Executive Officers With MSGE, MSGS and/or AMC Networks May Result in the Diversion of Corporate Opportunities and Other Conflicts to MSGE, MSGS and/or AMC Networks and Provisions in Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation May Provide Us No Remedy in That Circumstance.\nThe Company acknowledges that directors and officers of the Company may also be serving as directors, officers, employees, consultants or agents of MSGE, MSGS and/or AMC Networks and their respective subsidiaries and that the Company may engage in material business transactions with such entities. The Company\u2019s Board of Directors has adopted resolutions putting in place policies and arrangements whereby the Company has renounced its rights to certain business opportunities and no director or officer of the Company who is also serving as a director, officer, employee, consultant or agent of MSGE, MSGS and/or AMC Networks and their subsidiaries will be liable to the Company or its stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty that would otherwise occur by reason of the fact that any such individual directs a corporate opportunity (other than certain limited types of opportunities set forth in such policies) to MSGE, MSGS and/or AMC Networks or any of their subsidiaries instead of the Company, or does not refer or communicate information regarding such corporate opportunities to the Company.\nWe Could Have Significant Tax Liability as a Result of the Distribution.\nWe have obtained an opinion from Sullivan & Cromwell LLP substantially to the effect that, among other things, the Distribution qualifies as a tax-free distribution under the Internal Revenue Code, (the \u201cCode\u201d). The opinion is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) or the courts. Additionally, we have received a private letter ruling from the IRS concluding that certain limited aspects of the Distribution will not prevent the Distribution from satisfying certain requirements for tax-free treatment under the Code. The opinion and the private letter ruling rely on factual representations and reasonable assumptions, which if incorrect or inaccurate may jeopardize the ability to rely on such opinion and letter ruling.\nIf the Distribution does not qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then, in general, we would be subject to tax as if we had sold the MSGS common stock in a taxable sale for its fair value. MSGS stockholders would be subject to tax as if they had received a distribution equal to the fair value of MSGS common stock that was distributed to them, which generally would be treated first as a taxable dividend to the extent of our earnings and profits, then as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of each holder\u2019s tax basis in its MSGS common stock, and thereafter as capital gain with respect to any remaining value. It is expected that the amount of any such taxes to MSGS stockholders and us would be substantial.\nWe Rely on MSGS\u2019 and MSGE\u2019s Performance Under Various Agreements.\nWe have various agreements with MSGS, including a distribution agreement, a tax disaffiliation agreement, a services agreement, an employee matters agreement, and media rights agreements, and various agreements with MSGE, including a services agreement, an advertising sales representation agreement and a trademark license agreement, as well as certain other arrangements with each of MSGS and MSGE.\nThe agreements with MSGS include the allocation of employee benefits, taxes and certain other liabilities and obligations attributable to periods prior to the Distribution. In connection with the Distribution, we agreed to provide MSGS with indemnities with respect to liabilities arising out of our businesses and MSGS agreed to provide us with indemnities with respect to liabilities arising out of the businesses we transferred to MSGS.\nOur agreements with MSGS and MSGE also include arrangements with respect to support services and a number of on-going commercial relationships, including, with respect to MSGS, our media rights agreements for Knicks and Rangers games and, with respect to MSGE, the sale of our advertising inventory and our use of the \u201cMSG\u201d brand. The advertising sales representation agreement, services agreement and trademark license agreement are each subject to potential termination by MSGS or MSGE, as applicable, in the event MSGS or MSGE, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other, are no longer affiliates.\nMSGE currently provides certain business services to the Company, such as information technology, accounts payable, payroll, tax, certain legal functions, human resources, insurance and risk management, investor relations, corporate communications, benefit plan administration and reporting and internal audit functions, as well as certain executive support services. These services include the collection and storage of certain personal information regarding employees and/or customers as well as information regarding the Company and our Distributors and advertisers. See also \u201c-We Face Continually Evolving Cybersecurity and Similar Risks, Which Could Result in Loss, Disclosure, Theft, Destruction or Misappropriation of, or Access to, Our Confidential Information and Cause Disruption of Our Business, Damage to Our Brands and Reputation, Legal Exposure and Financial Losses.\u201d The services agreement with MSGE expired on June 30, 2020. In connection with the expiration of the MSGE services agreement, the Company entered into an interim agreement with MSGE, pursuant to which each party provides the other with the services described above on the same terms as provided in the services agreement on an interim basis while a new agreement is finalized. We expect to enter into a new services agreement with MSGE which will be retroactive to July 1, 2020. In addition, pursuant to a services agreement with MSGS, MSGS provides us with certain legal services.\nThe media rights agreements with MSGS provide us with the exclusive media rights to Knicks and Rangers games. Rights fees under these media rights agreements amounted to approximately $138.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2020, which reflect reductions as a result of MSGS\u2019 not making available the minimum number of games. The stated contractual rights fees under such rights agreements increase annually and are subject to adjustments in certain circumstances, including if MSGS does not make available a minimum number of games in any year.\nOur advertising sales representation agreement with MSGE, which has a term through June 30, 2022, provides for MSGE to act as our advertising sales representative and includes the exclusive right and obligation to sell certain advertising availabilities on our behalf for a commission. As a result of this arrangement, we depend on MSGE\u2019s performance for the sale of our advertising. The advertising sales representation agreement is subject to certain termination rights, including MSGE\u2019s right to terminate if MSGE and the Company are no longer affiliates and the Company\u2019s right to terminate if certain sales thresholds are not met unless MSGE elects to pay the Company the shortfall.\nThe Company and MSGS and MSGE, as applicable, each rely on the other to perform their respective obligations under all of these agreements. If MSGS or MSGE were to breach, be unable to satisfy its material obligations under these agreements, including a failure to satisfy its indemnification or other financial obligations, or these agreements otherwise terminate or expire and we do not enter into replacement agreements, we could suffer operational difficulties and/or significant losses.", "PERMNO": 93233, "SIC": 4841, "TIC": "MSGN"}
