Any of these risk factors could have a significant or material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. They could also cause significant fluctuations and volatility in the trading price of our securities. Readers should not consider any descriptions of these factors to be a complete set of all potential risks and uncertainties that could affect us. These factors should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this Annual Report and the other reports and materials filed by us with the SEC. Furthermore, many of these risks are interrelated, and the occurrence of certain of them may in turn cause the emergence or exacerbate the effect of others. Such a combination could materially increase the severity of the impact of these risks on our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nRisks Related to Proposed Transactions with Brookfield Renewable\nThere can be no assurance that the Transactions pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement with Brookfield Renewable will be consummated, the failure of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOn January 11, 2020, the Company received an unsolicited, non-binding proposal from Brookfield Renewable, an affiliate of Brookfield, to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company, other than the approximately 62% already held by Brookfield Renewable and its affiliates. The Brookfield Proposal expressly conditioned the transaction contemplated thereby on the approval of a committee of the Board consisting solely of independent Directors and the approval of a majority of the shares held by the Company\u2019s stockholders not affiliated with Brookfield Renewable and its affiliates. Following the Company\u2019s receipt of the Brookfield Proposal, the Board formed a Special Committee of non-executive, disinterested and independent Directors to, among other things, review, evaluate and consider the Brookfield Proposal and, if the Special Committee deemed appropriate, negotiate a transaction with Brookfield Renewable or explore alternatives thereto. The Board resolutions establishing the Special Committee expressly provided that the Board would not approve the transaction contemplated by the Brookfield Proposal or any alternative thereto without a prior favorable recommendation by the Special Committee.\nOn March 16, 2020, pursuant to the Brookfield Proposal, the Company and Brookfield Renewable and certain of their affiliates entered into the Reorganization Agreement for Brookfield Renewable to acquire all of the Company's outstanding shares of Common Stock, other than the 62% currently owned by Brookfield Renewable and its affiliates. Pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement, each holder of a share of Common Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the consummation of the Transactions will receive, at each such shareholder\u2019s election, 0.381 of a Brookfield Renewable limited partnership unit or of a Class A exchangeable subordinate voting share of Brookfield Renewable Corporation, a Canadian subsidiary of Brookfield Renewable which is expected to be publicly listed as of the consummation of the Transactions. The Special Committee has unanimously recommended that the Company\u2019s unaffiliated shareholders approve the Transactions. Consummation of the Transactions is subject to the non-waivable approval of a majority of the Company\u2019s shareholders not affiliated with Brookfield Renewable, receipt of required regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.\nWe cannot predict whether the Transactions would be approved by our shareholders. We also cannot assure the timing of the consummation of the Transactions. In addition, any changes in the market prices of our Common Stock, or to the publicly issued equity securities of Brookfield Renewable, could affect whether our shareholders ultimately approve the Transactions.\nIf the Transactions are not consummated for any reason, we may be subject to a number of known and unknown risks, including (i) the risk that the market price of our Common Stock reflects a market assumption that the Transactions will occur and that a failure to consummate the Transactions results in a decline in the market price of our Common Stock (ii) the risk that a failure to consummate the Transactions adversely impacts our relationships with employees, vendors, creditors and other business partners and results in negative publicity or a negative impression of the Company in the investment community; and (iii) the risk that we incur significant costs associated with the Transactions. If the Transactions are ultimately approved and consummated, there can be no assurances that the expected benefits of the Transactions will be realized.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe production of wind energy depends heavily on suitable wind conditions, and the production of solar energy depends on irradiance. If wind or solar conditions are unfavorable or below our estimates as a result of climate change or otherwise, our electricity production, and therefore our revenue, may be substantially below our expectations.\nThe electricity produced and revenues generated by a wind power plant depend heavily on wind conditions, which are variable and difficult to predict. Operating results for wind power plants vary significantly from period to period, depending on the wind conditions during the periods in question. The electricity produced and the revenues generated by a solar power plant depends heavily on insolation, which is the amount of solar energy received at a site. While somewhat more predictable than wind conditions, operating results for solar power plants can also vary from period to period depending on the solar conditions during the periods in question. We base our decisions about which sites to acquire and operate in part on the findings of long-\nterm wind, irradiance and other meteorological data and studies conducted in the proposed area, which, as applicable, measure the wind\u2019s speed and prevailing direction, the amount of solar irradiance a site is expected to receive and seasonal variations. Actual conditions at these sites, however, may not conform to the measured data in these studies and may be affected by variations in weather patterns, such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which has impacted our wind energy production in Hawaii, and any potential impact of climate change. If one or more of our sites were to be subject in the future to flooding, extreme weather conditions (including severe wind and droughts), fires, natural disasters, or if unexpected geological or other adverse physical conditions (including earthquakes) were to develop at any of our sites, the generation capacity of that site could be significantly reduced or even eliminated. Therefore, the electricity generated by our power plants may not meet our anticipated production levels or the rated capacity of the turbines or solar panels located there, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In some quarters the wind resources at our operating wind power plants, while within the range of our long-term estimates, have varied from the averages we expected. If the wind or solar resources at a facility are below the average level we expect, our rate of return for the facility would be below our expectations and we would be adversely affected. Projections of wind resources also rely upon assumptions about turbine placement, interference between turbines, and the effects of vegetation, land use and terrain, which involve uncertainty and require us to exercise considerable judgment. Projections of solar resources depend on assumptions about weather patterns (including snow), shading, and other assumptions which involve uncertainty and also require us to exercise considerable judgment. We or our consultants may make mistakes in conducting these wind, irradiance and other meteorological studies. Any of these factors could cause our sites to have less wind or solar potential than we expected and may cause us to pay more for wind and solar power plants in connection with acquisitions than we otherwise would have paid had such mistakes not been made, which could cause the return on our investment in these wind and solar power plants to be lower than expected.\nAs climate change increases the frequency and severity of severe weather conditions and may have the long-term effect of changing weather patterns, the disruptions to our sites may become more frequent and severe. In addition, our customers\u2019 energy needs generally vary with weather conditions, primarily temperature and humidity. To the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change, our customers\u2019 energy use could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of changing weather conditions, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf our wind and solar energy assessments turn out to be wrong, our business could suffer a number of material adverse consequences, including:\n\u2022our energy production and sales may be significantly lower than we predict;\n\u2022our hedging arrangements may be ineffective or costlier;\n\u2022we may not produce sufficient energy to meet our commitments to sell electricity or RECs and, as a result, we may have to buy potentially more expensive electricity or RECs on the open market to cover our obligations or pay damages; and\n\u2022our wind and solar power plants may not generate sufficient cash flow to make payments of principal and interest as they become due on our credit facilities, notes, and certain non-recourse debt, and we may have difficulty obtaining financing for future wind or solar power plants.\nCounterparties to our PPAs may not fulfill their obligations or may seek to terminate the PPA early, which could result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAll but a minor portion of the electricity generated by our current portfolio of renewable energy facilities is sold under long-term PPAs, including PPAs with public utilities or commercial, industrial, residential or government end-users or hedge agreements with investment banks and creditworthy counterparties. Certain of the PPAs associated with renewable energy facilities in our portfolio allow the offtake purchaser to terminate the PPA in the event certain operating thresholds or performance measures are not achieved within specified time periods or, in certain instances, by payment of an early termination fee. PPA counterparties in our distributed generation portfolio, such as retail companies and residential customers, may become bankrupt or insolvent. If a PPA was terminated or if, for any reason, any purchaser of power under these contracts is unable or unwilling to fulfill their related contractual obligations or refuses to accept delivery of power delivered thereunder (for example, due to bankruptcy or insolvency), and if we are unable to enter a new PPA on acceptable terms in a timely fashion or at all, we would be required to sell the power from the associated renewable energy facility into the wholesale power markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, seeking to enforce the obligations of our counterparties under our PPAs could be time consuming or costly with little certainty of success.\nCertain of our PPAs allow the offtake purchaser to buy out a portion of the renewable energy facility upon the occurrence of certain events, in which case we will need to find suitable replacement renewable energy facilities to invest in.\nCertain of the PPAs for renewable energy facilities in our portfolio or that we may acquire in the future give the offtake purchaser the right, in certain circumstances, to purchase all or a portion of the applicable renewable energy facility\nfrom us. If the offtake purchaser exercises its right to purchase all or a portion of the renewable energy facility, we would need to reinvest the proceeds from the sale in one or more renewable energy facilities with similar economic attributes in order to maintain our cash available for distribution. We may be unable to locate and acquire suitable replacement renewable energy facilities in a timely fashion, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash available for distribution.\nMost of our PPAs do not include inflation-based price increases.\nIn general, our PPAs do not contain inflation-based price increase provisions. To the extent that the jurisdictions in which we operate experience high rates of inflation, which increases our operating costs in those countries, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to offset the effects of inflation, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to replace expiring PPAs with contracts on similar terms. If we are unable to replace an expired distributed generation PPA with an acceptable new contract, we may be required to remove the renewable energy facility from the site or, alternatively, we may sell the assets to the site host.\nWe may not be able to replace an expiring PPA with a contract on equivalent terms and conditions, including at prices that permit operation of the related facility on a profitable basis. If we are unable to replace an expiring PPA with an acceptable new revenue contract, we may be required to sell the power produced by the facility at wholesale prices which may cause a significant reduction in CAFD and be exposed to market fluctuations and risks, or the affected site may temporarily or permanently cease operations. In the case of a distributed generation facility that ceases operations, the PPA terms generally require that we remove the assets, including fixing or reimbursing the site owner for any damages caused by the assets or the removal of such assets. The cost of removing a significant number of distributed generation facilities could be material. Alternatively, we may agree to sell the assets to the site owner, but the sale price may not be sufficient to replace the revenue previously generated by the solar generation facility.\nA material drop in the retail price of electricity generated by traditional utilities or electricity from other sources could limit our ability to attract new customers and adversely affect our growth.\nDecreases in the retail prices of electricity supplied by traditional utilities or other clean energy sources would harm our ability to offer competitive pricing and could harm our ability to sign PPAs with customers. The price of electricity from traditional utilities could decrease for a number of reasons, including:\n\u2022the construction of a significant number of new power generation plants, including nuclear, coal, natural gas or renewable energy facilities;\n\u2022the construction of additional electric transmission and distribution lines;\n\u2022a reduction in the price of natural gas, including as a result of new drilling techniques or a relaxation of associated regulatory standards;\n\u2022energy conservation technologies and sustained public initiatives to reduce electricity consumption; and\n\u2022the development of new energy technologies that provide less expensive energy.\nA shift in the timing of peak rates for electricity supplied by traditional utilities to a time of day when solar energy generation is less efficient could make solar energy less competitive and reduce demand. If the retail price of energy available from traditional utilities were to decrease, we would be at a competitive disadvantage in negotiating new PPAs and therefore we might be unable to attract new customers and our growth would be limited, and the value of our renewable energy facilities may be impaired or their useful life may be shortened.\nOur ability to generate revenue from certain utility-scale solar and wind power plants depends on having interconnection arrangements and services and the risk of curtailment of our renewable energy facilities may result in a reduced return on our investments and adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe operation of our utility scale renewable energy facilities depends on having interconnection arrangements with transmission providers and depends on a reliable electricity grid. If the interconnection or transmission agreement of a renewable energy facility we own or acquire is terminated for any reason (for example, due to the bankruptcy or insolvency of the transmission provider) we may not be able to replace it with an interconnection or transmission arrangement on terms as favorable as the existing arrangement, or at all, or we may experience significant delays or costs in securing a replacement. Moreover, if a transmission network to which one or more of our existing power plants or a power plant we acquire is connected experiences \u201cdown time,\u201d the affected renewable energy facility may lose revenue and be exposed to non-performance penalties and claims from its customers. Curtailment as a result of transmission system down time can arise from the need to prevent damage to the transmission system and for system emergencies, force majeure, safety, reliability,\nmaintenance or other operational reasons. Under our PPAs, our offtake purchasers are not generally required to compensate us for energy and ancillary services we could have delivered during these periods of curtailment had our facilities not been curtailed. Furthermore, the owners of the transmission network will not usually compensate electricity generators for lost income due to curtailment. These factors could materially affect our ability to forecast operations and negatively affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. One of our transmission providers, a public utility company based in California, filed for federal bankruptcy protection in January 2019. While we believe the financial impact to our business will be limited, there can be no assurance of the actual impact of the bankruptcy, or any future bankruptcies of any of our transmission providers (including other public utility companies in California to which we have exposure), on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Moreover, seeking to enforce the obligations of our counterparties under our interconnection agreements could be time consuming or costly and could involve little certainty of success.\nIn addition, we cannot predict whether transmission facilities will be expanded in specific markets to accommodate or increase competitive access to those markets. Expansion of the transmission system by transmission providers is costly, time consuming and complex. To the extent the transmission system is not adequate in an area, our operating facilities\u2019 generation of electricity may be physically or economically curtailed without compensation due to transmission capacity limitations, reducing our revenues and impairing our ability to capitalize fully on a particular facility\u2019s generating potential. Such curtailments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, economic congestion on the transmission grid (for instance, a positive price difference between the location where power is put on the grid by a clean power generation asset and the location where power is taken off the grid by the facility\u2019s customer) in certain of the bulk power markets in which we operate may occur and we may be deemed responsible for those congestion costs. If we were liable for such congestion costs, our financial results could be adversely affected.\nWe face competition from traditional utilities and renewable energy companies.\nThe solar and wind energy industries, and the broader clean energy industry, are highly competitive and continually evolving, as market participants strive to distinguish themselves within their markets and compete with large incumbent utilities and new market entrants. We believe that our primary competitors are the traditional incumbent utilities that supply energy to our potential customers under highly regulated rate and tariff structures. We compete with these traditional utilities primarily based on price, predictability of price and the ease with which customers can switch to electricity generated by our renewable energy facilities. If we cannot offer compelling value to our customers based on these factors, then our business will not grow. Traditional utilities generally have substantially greater financial, technical, operational and other resources than we do, and as a result may be able to devote more resources to the research, development, promotion and sale of their products or respond more quickly to evolving industry standards and changes in market conditions than we can. Traditional utilities could also offer other value-added products or services that could help them to compete with us even if the cost of electricity they offer is higher than ours. In addition, the source of a majority of traditional utilities\u2019 electricity is non-renewable, which may allow them to sell electricity more cheaply than electricity generated by our solar generation facilities and wind power plants. Such non-renewable generation is typically available for dispatch at any time, as it is not dependent on the availability of intermittent resources such as wind or insolation.\nWe also face risks that traditional utilities could change their volumetric-based (i.e., cents per kWh) rate and tariff structures to make distributed solar generation less economically attractive to their retail customers. Currently, net metering programs are utilized in the majority of states to support the growth of distributed generation facilities by requiring traditional utilities to reimburse certain of their retail customers for the excess power they generate at the level of the utilities\u2019 retail rates rather than the rates at which those utilities buy power at wholesale. Certain states allow its traditional utilities to assess a surcharge on customers with solar generation facilities for their use of the utility\u2019s grid, based on the size of the customer\u2019s solar generation facility. This surcharge reduces the economic returns for the excess electricity that the solar generation facilities produce. These types of charges, which reduce or eliminate the economic benefits of net metering, if implemented across a large number of states, could significantly change the economic benefits of solar energy as perceived by traditional utilities\u2019 retail customers.\nWe also face competition from other renewable energy companies who may offer different products, lower prices and other incentives, which may impact our ability to maintain our customer base. As the solar and wind industries grow and evolve, we will also face new competitors who are not currently in the market, such as an emerging storage market. Our failure to adapt to changing market conditions and to compete successfully with existing or new competitors could limit our growth and could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nThere are a limited number of purchasers of utility-scale quantities of electricity, which exposes us and our utility-scale facilities to additional risk.\nSince the transmission and distribution of electricity is either monopolized or highly concentrated in most jurisdictions, there are a limited number of possible purchasers for utility-scale quantities of electricity in a given geographic location,\nincluding transmission grid operators, state and investor-owned power companies, public utility districts and cooperatives. As a result, there is a concentrated pool of potential buyers for electricity generated by our renewable energy facilities, which may restrict our ability to negotiate favorable terms under new PPAs and could impact our ability to find new customers for the electricity generated by our renewable energy facilities should this become necessary. Furthermore, if the financial condition of these utilities and/or power purchasers deteriorated or the RPS programs, climate change programs or other regulations to which they are currently subject and that compel them to source renewable energy supplies change, demand for electricity produced by our utility-scale facilities could be negatively impacted. Within this concentrated pool, for certain of our assets, we have or in the future may increase our production capacity, thereby exposing us to additional risk in the event that demand for electricity in these territories declines.\nA portion of our revenues is attributable to the sale of renewable energy credits and solar renewable energy credits, which are renewable energy attributes that are created under the laws of individual states of the United States, and our failure to be able to sell such RECs or SRECs at attractive prices, or at all, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nA portion of our revenues is attributable to the sale of RECs, SRECs and other environmental attributes of our facilities. These RECs, SRECs and other environmental attributes are created under the state laws, generally in the state where the renewable energy facility is located. We sometimes seek to sell forward a portion of our RECs, SRECs or other environmental attributes under contracts having terms in excess of one year to fix the revenues from those attributes and hedge against future declines in prices of RECs, SRECs or other environmental attributes. These programs have a finite life and our revenues may decline if and when we are unable to generate a sufficient number of RECs or SRECs. If our renewable energy facilities do not generate the amount of electricity required to earn the RECs, SRECs or other environmental attributes sold under such forward contracts or if for any reason the electricity we generate does not produce RECs, SRECs or other environmental attributes for a particular state, we may be required to make up the shortfall of RECs, SRECs or other environmental attributes under such forward contracts through purchases on the open market or make payments of liquidated damages. We have from time to time provided guarantees of Terra LLC or Terra Operating LLC as credit support for these obligations. Additionally, forward contracts for REC or SREC sales often contain adequate assurances clauses that allow our counterparties to require us to provide credit support in the form of parent guarantees, letters of credit or cash collateral.\nOur ability to hedge forward our anticipated volume of RECs, SRECs or other environmental attributes is limited by market conditions, leaving us exposed to the risk of falling prices for RECs, SRECs or other environmental attributes. Utilities in many states are required by law or regulation to purchase a portion of their energy from renewable energy sources. Changes in state laws or regulations relating to RECs or SRECs may adversely affect the demand for, or availability of, RECs, SRECs or other environmental attributes and the future prices for such products. This could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are involved in costly and time-consuming litigation and other disputes, which require significant attention from our management, involve exposure to legal liability and may result in significant damage awards.\nAs more fully described in Note 20. Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements, included in this Annual Report, we have been subject to claims arising out of our acquisition activities with respect to certain payments in connection with the acquisition of First Wind Holdings, LLC by SunEdison. D.E. Shaw Composite Holdings, L.L.C. and Madison Dearborn Capital Partners IV, L.P., as the representatives of the sellers (the \u201cFirst Wind Sellers\u201d) pursuant to the Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated as of November 17, 2014 (the \u201cFW Purchase Agreement\u201d) between, among others, SunEdison, the Company and Terra LLC and the First Wind Sellers have alleged a breach of contract with respect to the FW Purchase Agreement and that Terra LLC and SunEdison became jointly obligated to make $231.0 million in earn-out payments in respect of certain development assets SunEdison acquired from the First Wind Sellers under the FW Purchase Agreement, when those payments were purportedly accelerated by SunEdison\u2019s bankruptcy and by the resignations of two SunEdison employees. The First Wind Sellers have also alleged that the Company, as guarantor of certain Terra LLC obligations under the FW Purchase Agreement, is liable for this sum. In addition, the plaintiffs have claimed legal costs and expenses and, under the applicable New York law, their claim accrues interest at a non-compounding rate of 9% per annum. We believe the allegations for both of these matters are without merit and will contest the claim and allegations vigorously. However, we cannot predict with certainty the ultimate resolution of any proceedings brought in connection with these claims.\nWe also have been and continue to be involved in legal proceedings, administrative proceedings, claims and other litigation that arise in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings related to the operation of our renewable energy facilities. For example, individuals or groups have in the past and may in the future challenge the issuance of a permit for a renewable energy facility or may make claims related to alleged impacts of the operation of our renewable energy facilities on adjacent properties. We are currently and/or may in the future be subject to claims, lawsuits or arbitration proceedings related to matters in tort or under contracts, employment matters, securities class action lawsuits, stockholder derivative actions, breaches of fiduciary duty, conflicts of interest, tax authority examinations or other lawsuits, regulatory actions or government inquiries\nand investigations. In addition, we are currently and/or may in the future be named as defendants in other lawsuits and regulatory actions or investigations relating to our business, some of which may claim significant damages.\nIn the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock or have had delayed SEC filings have been subject to securities class action litigation. We have been the target of such securities litigation in the past and we may become the target of additional securities litigation in the future. As more fully described in Note 20. Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements, included in this Annual Report, the Company, Brookfield and members of our Board of Directors have been subject to shareholder claims, including the derivative and class action lawsuit filed by lead plaintiff Martin Rosson in September 2019, in connection with our funding of our acquisition of Saeta, alleging that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties to shareholders. Securities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits are also often brought against companies that have entered into merger agreements in an effort to enjoin the merger or seek monetary relief from the counterparties. It is possible that the Brookfield Renewable Merger would attract these types of lawsuits. Even if such lawsuits are without merit, defending against any such claims can result in substantial costs and divert management time and resources. Additionally, if a plaintiff is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting completion of the Brookfield Renewable Merger, then that injunction may delay or prevent the Brookfield Renewable Merger from being completed, or from being completed within the expected timeframe, which may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial position and results of operation. We cannot predict whether such lawsuits would actually arise or the occurrence, outcome or impact of any such lawsuits nor can we predict the amount of time and expense that would be required to resolve any such litigation.\nDue to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. Unfavorable outcomes or developments relating to these proceedings, or new proceedings involving similar allegations or otherwise, such as monetary damages or equitable remedies or potential negative publicity associated with such legal actions, could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial position, results of operations or cash flows or limit our ability to engage in certain of our business activities. Settlement of claims could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceedings, such proceedings are often expensive, lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations and require significant attention from our management, and may at times divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate the operations, technologies and personnel of the projects we acquire from third parties, including the distributed generation portfolio that we acquired from subsidiaries of AltaGas, which could result in a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe believe the acquisition of projects from third parties, including the approximately 320 MW portfolio of distributed generation facilities in the United States from subsidiaries of AltaGas, will be accretive to cash available for distribution to our stockholders on a per share basis. However, to realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions, the acquired projects must be successfully combined with our existing business. We may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition and any other third party acquisitions as a result of our inability to successfully integrate the assets and, if applicable, operations, technologies and personnel of the acquired business with and into our existing business for a variety of reasons, including the following:\n\u2022failure to successfully manage relationships with existing contract counterparties;\n\u2022failure to quickly and effectively leverage the increased scale of the combined company;\n\u2022the loss of key employees; and\n\u2022potential difficulties integrating and harmonizing financial reporting systems and establishing appropriate accounting controls, reporting procedures and regulatory compliance procedures.\nWe may not realize the expected benefits of our LTSAs with General Electric, SMA and other O&M providers and we may be subject to risk associated with having a concentrated pool of O&M providers.\nIn August 2018, we executed an 11-year framework agreement with an affiliate of General Electric to provide us with long-term service agreements (\u201cLTSAs\u201d) for turbine operations and maintenance as well as other balance of plant services for our 1.6 GW North American wind fleet. In November 2019, we executed a 10-year framework agreement with SMA Solar Technology that, among other things, provides for the roll out, subject to receipt of third-party consents, of project level LTSAs for solar operations and maintenance services, as well as other balance of plant services across our North American solar fleet (excluding the DG Portfolio). During 2019, we also executed new LTSAs with the original equipment manufacturers for turbine operations and maintenance services for our European wind fleet.\nThese LTSAs are expected to improve performance of the wind and solar assets that they cover, and in certain circumstances, realize cost savings. However, we may not be able to fully realize these anticipated benefits or at all. For example, we may not achieve increased production from our wind and solar fleet or realize any of the expected cost savings. While we have put in place LTSAs on all but one of our North American wind projects, there can be no assurances that we will\nreceive the necessary consents required to put the LTSA in place at the final wind project. Similarly, while we are able to implement the LTSAs with SMA at the majority of our North American solar projects without needing third party consents, there can be no assurance that will be able to procure the necessary consents needed for the remainder of the projects. Furthermore, as a result of the LTSA with GE and SMA, we have concentrated the sourcing of our North American wind and solar O&M services in two service providers. If either GE or SMA become insolvent, or otherwise are unable or unwilling to perform their obligations under the applicable LTSAs or framework agreements, it may be difficult to quickly identify alternative service providers on favorable terms, which may result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may disagree with our service providers on the scope or nature of their obligations in the applicable LTSAs, framework agreements and other agreements, including the calculation of liquidated damages under the LTSAs, and because of this concentration risk, any such disagreement could lead to delays in performance, costly arbitration or litigation, or other adverse developments, any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, during 2019, as a result of our acquisition of the WGL Portfolio, we acquired a portfolio of fuel cells which are reliant on proprietary technology and intellectual property of a third party who also serves as the O&M provider for the portfolio. If this third party becomes insolvent or otherwise is unable or unwilling to perform its contractual obligations to us, we may not be able to adequately operate and maintain our fuel cell portfolio, which may have an adverse effect on us.\nMaintenance, expansion and refurbishment of renewable energy facilities involve significant risks that could result in unplanned power outages or reduced output or cause significant injury or property damage.\nOur facilities may require periodic upgrading and improvement. Any unexpected operational or mechanical failure, such as the failure of a single faulty blade which caused the collapse of a tower at our Raleigh wind facility in 2018, other single blade failures at our Bishop Hill, Cal Ridge and Cohocton wind facilities during 2019 and 2020, or other failures associated with breakdowns and forced outages generally, and any decreased operational or management performance, could reduce our facilities\u2019 generating capacity below expected levels, reducing our revenues and jeopardizing our ability to pay distributions to holders of our Common Stock at forecasted levels or at all. Incomplete performance by us or third parties under O&M agreements, including subcontractors, may increase the risks of operational or mechanical failure of our facilities which could cause significant personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, plant and equipment and contamination of, or damage to, the environment and suspension of operations, which could expose us to significant liability. Degradation of the performance of our renewable energy facilities provided for in the related PPAs may also reduce our revenues. Unanticipated capital expenditures associated with maintaining, upgrading or repairing our facilities may also reduce profitability.\nWe may also choose to refurbish or upgrade our facilities based on our assessment that such activity will provide adequate financial returns and key assumptions underpinning a decision to make such an investment may prove incorrect, including assumptions regarding construction costs, timing, available financing and future power prices. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMoreover, spare parts for wind turbines and solar facilities and key pieces of equipment may be hard to acquire or unavailable to us. Sources of some significant spare parts and other equipment are located outside of North America and the other jurisdictions in which we operate. Suppliers of some spare parts have filed, or will in the future file for, bankruptcy protection, potentially reducing the availability of parts that we require to operate certain of our power generation facilities. Suppliers may be reliant on global supply chains, including supply chains that extend to areas that are subject to economic disruptions, as is the case currently where supply chains have been disrupted by the outbreak of the COVID-19 coronavirus, which began in December 2019. Other suppliers may for other reasons cease to manufacture parts that we require to operate certain of our power generation facilities. If we were to experience a shortage of or inability to acquire critical spare parts we could incur significant delays in returning facilities to full operation, which could negatively impact the financial condition of our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nRenewable energy facilities depend on a limited number of suppliers of solar panels, inverters, module turbines, towers and other system components and turbines and other equipment associated with wind and solar power plants. Any shortage, delay or component price change from these suppliers could result in construction or installation delays, which could affect the number of renewable energy facilities we are able to acquire in the future.\nThere have been periods of industry-wide shortage of key components, including solar panels and wind turbines, in times of rapid industry growth. The manufacturing infrastructure for some of these components has a long lead time, requires significant capital investment and relies on the continued availability of key commodity materials, potentially resulting in an inability to meet demand for these components. A shortage of key commodity materials could also lead to a reduction in the number of renewable energy facilities that we may have the opportunity to acquire in the future, or delay or increase the costs of acquisitions.\nIn addition, potential acquisition of solar projects could be more challenging as a result of increases in the cost of solar panels or tariffs on imported solar panels imposed by the U.S. government. The U.S. government has imposed tariffs on imported solar cells and modules manufactured in China. If project developers purchase solar panels containing cells manufactured in China, our purchase price for renewable energy facilities may reflect the tariff penalties mentioned above. While solar panels containing solar cells manufactured outside of China are not subject to these tariffs, the prices of these solar panels are, and may continue to be, more expensive than panels produced using Chinese solar cells, before giving effect to the tariff penalties.\nThe declining cost of solar panels and the raw materials necessary to manufacture them has been a key driver in the pricing of solar energy systems and customer adoption of this form of renewable energy. With the stabilization or increase of solar panel and raw materials prices, our growth could slow. Although we do not purchase solar panels directly, higher cost solar panels could make future purchases of solar assets more difficult.\nThe repowering of existing wind and solar generation projects in our portfolio is subject to construction risks, tax risk, and risks associated with the arrangements we enter into with local stakeholders and joint venture partners.\nWe may from time to time seek to replace all or part of an existing wind or solar project with new more efficient equipment in order to improve performance, lower costs, decrease operational risk and extend the useful life of such a project. This process is referred to as a repowering. Repowerings could include replacing existing wind turbines, solar panels, inverters or other components with new equipment. Our ability to repower a project is dependent on, among other things, our ability to procure equipment and parts, including parts that are subject to safe harbors for federal tax credits and other incentives, and to complete all necessary construction contemplated for a particular repowering on time and on budget. The repowering of an existing generating facility may be subject to environmental, engineering, tax and construction risks that could result in cost overruns, delays and reduced performance, or in a planned repowering not happening at all. A number of factors that could cause such delays, cost over runs or reduced performance or cancellation of a planned repowering include, but are not limited to, changes in local laws or difficulties in obtaining permits, rights of way or approvals, changing engineering and design requirements, construction costs exceeding estimates for various reasons, including inaccurate engineering and planning, failures to properly estimate the cost of raw materials, components, equipment, labor or the inability to timely obtain them, unanticipated problems with project start-up, the performance of contractors, the insolvency of the head contractor or of a major equipment supplier (including panel, inverter and wind turbine supplier), a major subcontractor and/or a key equipment supplier, labor disruptions, inclement weather, defects in design, engineering or construction (including, without limitation, latent defects that do not materialize during an applicable warranty or limitation period), the occurrence of force majeure events and any unanticipated project modifications. The repowering of certain projects in the United States may also depend on the availability of equipment that is subject to safe harbors for federal tax credits and the availability of construction financing, tax equity and other forms of financing in capital markets.\nA delay in the projected completion of a repowering can result in a material increase in total construction costs through higher capitalized interest charges, additional labor and other expenses, a loss of production tax credits in the United States and a resultant delay in the re-commencement of cash flow. In addition, such unexpected issues may result in increased debt service costs, operations and maintenance expenses and damage payments for late delivery or the failure to meet agreed upon generation levels. This may result in an inability to meet the higher interest and principal repayments arising from any additional debt required.\nIn some circumstances, we may be required to notify, consult, or obtain the consent of certain stakeholders, including landowners and municipalities, regarding a repowering transaction. Certain of these communities and partners may have or may develop interests or objectives which are different from or even in conflict with our objectives. Any such differences could have a negative impact on the success of any contemplated repowering.\nWe may incur unexpected expenses if the suppliers of components of our renewable energy facilities default in their warranty obligations.\nThe solar panels, inverters, modules and other system components utilized in our solar generation facilities are generally covered by manufacturers\u2019 warranties, which typically range from 5 to 20 years. When purchasing wind turbines, the purchaser will enter into warranty agreements with the manufacturer which typically expire within two to five years after the turbine delivery date. In the event any such components fail to operate as required, we may be able to make a claim against the applicable warranty to cover all or a portion of the expense associated with the faulty component. However, these suppliers could cease operations and no longer honor the warranties, which would leave us to cover the expense associated with the faulty component. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected if we cannot make claims under warranties covering our renewable energy facilities.\nConcentrated solar power facilities use technology that differs from traditional solar photovoltaic technology and is subject to known and unknown risks.\nOur concentrated solar power (\u201cCSP\u201d) facilities located in Spain consist primarily of parabolic troughs that concentrate reflected light onto receiver tubes. The receiver tubes are filled with a working fluid which is heated by the concentrated sunlight and then used to heat water for a standard steam power generation system. This technology differs from that used in more common solar photovoltaic (\u201cPV\u201d) facilities and concentrated solar technology is much less widely used worldwide and is subject to known and unknown risks that differ from those associated with solar PV facilities. For example, the temperatures used in concentrated solar facilities can be extremely high. Fires or leaks of heated working fluid at any of our facilities could result in a loss of generating capacity and could require us to expend significant amounts of capital and other resources. Such failures could result in personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, plant and equipment and contamination of, or damage to, the environment and suspension of operations, which could expose us to significant liability. Repairing any such failure could require us to expend significant amounts of capital and other resources.\nAs a result of our recent acquisition of certain solar rooftop residential assets, we are subject to financing and consumer protection laws and regulations.\nWe recently acquired over 4,000 solar rooftop residential assets in California and Arizona. As a result of this acquisition and any future acquisitions of residential solar assets, we have become subject to certain consumer protection laws that may not be applicable to our commercial and power plant businesses, such as privacy and data security, federal truth-in-lending, consumer leasing, and equal credit opportunity laws and regulations, as well as state and local finance laws and regulations. Claims arising out of actual or alleged violations of law may be asserted against us by individuals or governmental entities and may expose us to significant damages or other penalties, including fines that could be material to our business.\nOperation of renewable energy facilities involves significant risks and hazards that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We may not have adequate insurance to cover these risks and hazards.\nThe ongoing operation of our facilities involves risks that include the breakdown or failure of equipment, such as the failure of a single faulty blade which caused the collapse of a tower at our Raleigh wind facility in 2018, other single blade failures at our Bishop Hill, Cal Ridge and Cohocton wind facilities during 2019 and 2020, or processes or performance below expected levels of output or efficiency due to wear and tear, latent defect, design error or operator error or force majeure events, among other things. Unplanned outages of generating units, including extensions of scheduled outages, occur from time to time and are an inherent risk of our business. Unplanned outages typically increase our operation and maintenance expenses and may reduce our revenues as a result of generating and selling less power or require us to incur significant costs as a result of obtaining replacement power from third parties in the open market to satisfy our forward power sales obligations.\nOur inability to efficiently operate our renewable energy facilities, manage capital expenditures and costs and generate earnings and cash flow from our assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. While we maintain insurance, obtain warranties from vendors and obligate contractors to meet certain performance levels (in some cases backed by liquidated damages from the contractor), the proceeds of such insurance, warranties or performance guarantees may not cover our lost revenues, increased expenses or payments should we experience equipment breakdown or non-performance by contractors or vendors.\nPower generation involves hazardous activities, including delivering electricity to transmission and distribution systems. In addition to natural risks such as earthquake, flood, lightning, hurricane and wind, other hazards, such as fire, structural collapse and machinery failure are inherent risks in our operations. These and other hazards can cause significant personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, plant and equipment and contamination of, or damage to, the environment and suspension of operations. The occurrence of any one of these events may result in our being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting claims for substantial damages, including for environmental cleanup costs, personal injury and property damage and fines and/or penalties. We maintain an amount of insurance protection that we consider adequate but we cannot provide any assurance that our insurance will be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which we may be subject. Furthermore, our insurance coverage is subject to deductibles, caps, exclusions and other limitations. A loss for which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Furthermore, due to rising insurance costs and changes in the insurance markets, we cannot provide any assurance that our insurance coverage will continue to be available at all or at rates or on terms similar to those presently available. Any losses not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur hedging activities may not adequately manage our exposure to commodity and financial risk, which could result in significant losses or require us to use cash collateral to meet margin requirements, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity, and impair our ability to execute favorable financial hedges in the future.\nCertain of our wind power plants are party to financial swaps or other similarly structured hedging arrangements (\u201cswaps\u201d). We may also acquire additional assets with similar hedging arrangements in the future. Under the terms of the existing swaps, certain wind power plants receive payments for specified quantities of electricity based on a fixed-price and are obligated to deliver (if physically settled) or pay (if financially settled) the counterparty the market price for the same quantities of electricity. These swaps cover quantities of electricity that we estimated are highly likely to be produced. As a result, gains or losses under the swaps are designed to be offset by decreases or increases in a facility\u2019s revenues from spot sales of electricity in liquid markets. However, the actual amount of electricity a facility generates from operations may be materially different from our estimates for a variety of reasons, including variable wind conditions and wind turbine availability. If a wind power plant does not generate the volume of electricity required by the associated contract, we could incur significant losses if electricity prices in the market rise substantially above the fixed-price provided for in the swap arrangement. This risk is particularly acute in the ERCOT market during summer months due to low reserve margins and the attendant risk of scarcity pricing. If a wind power plant generates more electricity than is contracted in the swap arrangement, the excess production will not be hedged and the related revenues will be exposed to market price fluctuations.\nMoreover, in some power markets, at times we have experienced negative power prices with respect to merchant energy sales. In these situations, we must pay grid operators to take our power. Because our tax investors receive production tax credits from the production of energy from our wind plants, it may be economical for the plant to continue to produce power at negative prices, which results in the applicable facility paying for the power it produces. In addition, certain swap arrangements are settled with reference to energy prices (or locational marginal prices) at a certain hub or node on the transmission system in the relevant energy market. At the same time, revenues generated by physical sales of energy from the applicable facility may be determined by the energy price (or locational marginal price) at a different node on the transmission system. This is an industry practice used to address the lack of liquidity at individual facility locations. There is a risk, however, that prices at these two nodes differ materially, and as a result of this so called \u201cbasis risk,\u201d we may be required to settle our swaps at prices that are higher than the prices at which we are able to sell physical power from the applicable facility, thus reducing the economic effectiveness of the swap hedges. Basis risk is particularly acute in the Texas Panhandle, where we own one wind power plant with over 200 MW of nameplate capacity, due to transmission constraints caused by line outages and high wind penetration.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks because certain of our renewable energy facilities are located outside of the United States.\nWe generate a substantial portion of our revenues and incur a substantial portion of our expenses in currencies other than U.S. dollars. The portion of our revenues generated in currencies other than U.S. dollars may increase in the future if we continue to acquire additional assets outside of the United States. Changes in economic or political conditions in any of the countries in which we operate now or in the future could result in exchange rate movement, expropriation, new currency or exchange controls or other restrictions being imposed on our operations. As our financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, if we generate revenue or earnings in other currencies, the translation of those results into U.S. dollars can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those revenues or earnings. To the extent that we are unable to match revenues received in foreign currencies with costs paid in the same currency, exchange rate fluctuations in any such currency could have a negative impact on our profitability. Our debt service requirements are primarily in U.S. dollars even though a percentage of our cash flow is generated in other foreign currencies and therefore significant changes in the value of such foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could have a material negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to meet interest and principal payments on debts denominated in U.S. dollars. In addition to currency translation risks, we incur currency transaction risks whenever we or one of our facilities enter into a purchase or sales transaction using a currency other than the local currency of the transacting entity.\nGiven the volatility of exchange rates, there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively manage our currency transaction and/or translation risks. It is possible that volatility in currency exchange rates will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. We expect to experience economic losses and gains and negative and positive impacts on earnings as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, particularly as a result of changes in the value of the Euro.\nAdditionally, although a portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in foreign currency, any distributions we pay will be denominated in U.S. dollars. The amount of U.S. dollar denominated distributions paid to our holders of our Common Stock will therefore be exposed to a certain level of currency exchange rate risk. Although we have entered into certain hedging arrangements to help mitigate some of this exchange rate risk, these arrangements may not be sufficient to\neliminate the risk. Changes in the foreign exchange rates could have a material negative impact on our results of operations and may adversely affect the amount of cash distributions paid by us to holders of our Common Stock.\nPolitical instability, changes in government policy, or unfamiliar cultural factors could adversely impact the value of our investments.\nWe are subject to geopolitical uncertainties in all jurisdictions in which we operate. We make investments in businesses that are based outside of the United States, and we may pursue investments in unfamiliar markets, which may expose us to additional risks not typically associated with investing in the United States. We may not properly adjust to the local culture and business practices in such markets, and there is the prospect that we may hire personnel or partner with local persons who might not comply with our culture and ethical business practices; either scenario could result in the failure of our initiatives in new markets and lead to financial losses. There are risks of political instability in several of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business, including, for example, social and political unrest (e.g., recent social unrest in Chile), tariffs, income inequality, refugee migration, terrorism, the potential break-up of political-economic unions (or the departure of a union member, e.g., Brexit) and political corruption. The materialization of one or more of these risks in markets where we own and operate assets could create economic uncertainty that causes disruptions to our businesses, including affecting the business of and/or our relationships with our customers, contractors and suppliers which could in turn negatively affect our financial performance. For example, although the long-term impact on economic conditions is uncertain, Brexit may have an adverse effect on the rate of economic growth in the U.K. and continental Europe.\nOur business is subject to substantial governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by changes in laws or regulations, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or other legal requirements.\nOur business is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws in the U.S. and regulations in the foreign countries in which we operate. Compliance with the requirements under these various regulatory regimes may cause us to incur significant costs, and failure to comply with such requirements could result in the shutdown of the non-complying facility or, the imposition of liens, fines and/or civil or criminal liability.\nWith the exception of certain of our utility scale plants, our renewable energy facilities located in the United States in our portfolio are QFs as defined under PURPA. Depending upon the power production capacity of the facility in question, our QFs and their immediate project company owners may be entitled to various exemptions from wholesale ratemaking and certain other regulatory provisions of the FPA, from the federal and state books and records access provisions of PUHCA and FERC\u2019s record-keeping, accounting, and reporting obligations under PUHCA, and from state ratemaking, organizational and financial regulation of electric utilities.\nOn September 19, 2019, FERC published a NOPR to revise its PURPA regulations. Of relevance to our QFs, the NOPR proposes to revise (i) the obligation of interconnected utilities to purchase power from renewable QFs under 20 MW and the terms and conditions of such purchases, (ii) the process for third-party challenges to the QF status of self-certified projects, and (iii) the rules used to aggregate and treat as a single facility (for purposes of the 80 MW QF size limit and other exemption thresholds) renewable QFs that use the same fuel source, are owned or operated by the same person or its affiliates, and are located within a certain distance of each other. The public comment period on the NOPR closed on December 3, 2019.\nThe immediate owners of certain of our utility scale plants are EWGs, as defined under PUHCA, which allows their upstream owners to qualify for an exemption from the federal books and access provisions of PUHCA and FERC\u2019s record-keeping, accounting, and reporting obligations under PUHCA. Certain of the EWGs also own QFs. EWGs are often subject to regulation for most purposes as \u201cpublic utilities\u201d under the FPA, including regulation of their wholesale rates and their issuances of securities and assumption of liabilities. Each of our EWGs (except Evergreen Gen Lead, LLC) has obtained \u201cmarket based rate authorization\u201d and associated blanket authorizations and waivers from FERC under the FPA, which allows it to sell electricity, capacity and ancillary services at wholesale at negotiated, market based rates, instead of cost-of-service rates, as well as waivers of, and blanket authorizations under, certain FERC regulations that are commonly granted to market based rate sellers, including blanket authorizations to issue securities and assume liabilities. FERC typically grants an entity the authority to charge market-based rates as long as the entity can demonstrate that it does not have, or has adequately mitigated, market power and it cannot otherwise erect barriers to market entry. Currently, none of our project companies or their affiliates has been found by FERC to have the potential to exercise market power in any U.S. markets. In the event that FERC\u2019s analysis of market power changes or if certain other conditions of market-based rate authority are not met, FERC has the authority to impose mitigation measures or withhold or rescind market-based rate authority and require sales to be made based on cost-of-service rates, which could result in a reduction in rates.\nIn addition to QFs and EWGs, we own certain fuel cell projects in a number of U.S. states that engage exclusively in retail energy sales. These projects are not subject to regulation under the FPA; however, they are \u201celectric utility companies\u201d\nunder PUHCA. We have obtained an exemption from federal regulation under PUHCA predicated on specific facts and representations made to FERC. In the event that we no longer qualify for such exemption, we could become subject to the federal books and access provisions of PUHCA and FERC\u2019s record-keeping, accounting, and reporting obligations under PUHCA.\nThe failure of our QFs to maintain QF status may result in their owners becoming subject to significant additional regulatory requirements. In addition, the failure of the EWGs or our QFs to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in the imposition of civil penalties or other sanctions. FERC has the authority to assess substantial civil penalties (i.e. up to approximately $1.3 million USD per day per violation) for failure to comply with the conditions of market-based rate authority and the requirements of the FPA and PUHCA.\nIn particular, any person or entity that engages in FERC-jurisdictional transactions (e.g., wholesale power sales), including our EWGs and any project companies that own or operate our QFs, are subject to certain market behavior and anti-manipulation rules as established and enforced by FERC, and if they are determined to have violated those rules, will be subject to potential disgorgement of profits associated with the violation, penalties, and suspension or revocation of their market-based rate authority. If such entities were to lose their market-based rate authority, they would be required to obtain FERC\u2019s acceptance of a cost-of-service rate schedule for wholesale sales of electric energy, capacity and ancillary services and could become subject to significant accounting, record-keeping, and reporting requirements that are imposed on FERC regulated public utilities with cost-based rate schedules.\nSubstantially all of our assets are also subject to the rules and regulations applicable to power generators generally, in particular the NERC Reliability Standards or similar standards in jurisdictions in which we operate. If we fail to comply with these mandatory Reliability Standards, we could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties, increased compliance obligations and disconnection from the grid.\nThe regulatory environment for electricity generation in the United States has undergone significant changes in the last several years due to state and federal policies affecting the wholesale and retail power markets and the creation of incentives for the addition of large amounts of new renewable energy generation and demand response resources. These changes are ongoing and we cannot predict the ultimate effect that the changing regulatory environment will have on our business. In addition, in some of these markets, interested parties have proposed material market design changes, as well as made proposals to re-regulate the markets or require divestiture of power generation assets by asset owners or operators to reduce their market share. If competitive restructuring of the power markets is reversed, discontinued or delayed, our business prospects and financial results could be negatively impacted.\nThe principal revenues generated by our regulated wind and solar assets in Spain are received pursuant to a \u201cregulated return\u201d that is set by legislation. While some of the parameters that go in to calculating the remuneration are subject to periodic review every three and six years, the Spanish legislature ultimately has the power to, as it sees fit, change the regulated return that our Spanish portfolio receives.\nPursuant to Royal Decree 413/2014, renewable electricity producers in Spain receive two principal payment streams: (i) the pool price for the power they produce; and (ii) a return on investment payment based on the standard investment cost for each type of plant (this second payment is not linked to the amount of power they produce). For certain technologies with a high operational expense (including our solar PV and CSP facilities in Spain), the return on investment is supplemented by a return on operations payment. The principle underpinning this economic regime is that the payments received by a renewable energy producer should be equivalent to the costs that they are unable to recover on the electricity pool market where they compete with non-renewable technologies. This economic regime seeks to allow a \u201cwell-run and efficient enterprise\u201d to recover the costs of building and running a plant, plus a \u201creasonable return\u201d on investment (project investment rate of return) over a regulated standard investment cost for each type of plant defined by the government.\nIn November 2019, the Spanish government issued Royal Decree-Law 17/2019, which set the reasonable return at 7.09% for the next regulatory period (through December 31, 2025) for all assets. However, Royal Decree-Law 17/2019 contained an exception for all plants (i) that were commissioned prior to July 2013 and (ii) that did not have any pending litigation against the Kingdom of Spain regarding the prior regulatory change that took place in July 2013. For these excepted assets, Royal Decree-Law 17/2019 maintained 7.39% as the reasonable return for the next two regulatory periods (through December 31, 2031). As a result, all of our assets in Spain will be entitled to the more favorable regulated rate of 7.39% through December 31, 2031, except for the approximately 45 MW of solar PV assets that we acquired in December 2019 and the approximately 100 MW of CSP assets that we acquired subsequent to year end, each of which are entitled to a reasonable return rate of 7.09% through December 31, 2025.\nWhile the regulated returns that our facilities benefit from currently are favorable to us, it is possible in the future that they will be revised by the legislature in a way that results in a material decrease in the revenues received by our regulated wind\nand solar assets in Spain, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRevenue from our wind projects in Uruguay is significantly dependent on long-term fixed rate arrangements that restrict our ability to increase revenue from these operations.\nIn all of our agreements in Uruguay, we have long term PPAs with the Administraci\u00f3n Nacional de Usinas y Transmisiones El\u00e9ctricas (\u201cUTE\u201d), Uruguay\u2019s state-owned electricity company. Under these PPAs, we are required to deliver power at a fixed rate for the contract period, in all cases inflation adjusted. In addition, during the life of a concession, the relevant government authority may unilaterally impose additional restrictions on our tariff rates, subject to the regulatory frameworks applicable in each jurisdiction. Furthermore, changes in laws and regulations may, in certain cases, have retroactive effect and expose us to additional compliance costs or interfere with our existing financial and business planning.\nLaws, governmental regulations and policies supporting renewable energy, and specifically solar and wind energy (including tax incentives), could change at any time, including as a result of new political leadership, and such changes may materially adversely affect our business and our growth strategy.\nRenewable energy generation assets currently benefit from, or are affected by, various federal, state and local governmental incentives and regulatory policies. In the United States, these policies include federal ITCs, PTCs, and trade import tariff policies, as well as state RPS and integrated resource plan programs, state and local sales and property taxes, siting policies, grid access policies, rate design, net energy metering, and modified accelerated cost-recovery system of depreciation. The growth of our wind and solar energy business will also be dependent on the federal and state tax and regulatory regimes generally and as they relate in particular to our investments in our wind and solar facilities. For example, future growth in the renewable energy industry in the U.S. will be impacted by the availability of the ITC and PTCs and accelerated depreciation and other changes to the federal income tax codes, including reductions in rates or changes that affect the ability of tax equity providers to effectively obtain the benefit of available tax credits or deductions or forecast their future tax liabilities, which may materially impair the market for tax equity financing for wind and solar power plants. Any effort to overturn federal and state laws, regulations or policies that are supportive of wind and solar power plants or that remove costs or other limitations on other types of generation that compete with wind and solar power plants could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn the U.S., many states have adopted RPS programs mandating that a specified percentage of electricity sales come from eligible sources of renewable energy. If the RPS requirements are reduced or eliminated, it could lead to fewer future power contracts or lead to lower prices for the sale of power in future power contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on our future growth prospects. Such material adverse effects may result from decreased revenues, reduced economic returns on certain project company investments, increased financing costs and/or difficulty obtaining financing.\nOur projects located internationally typically benefit from RPS regimes, feed-in tariffs or other regulatory incentives. For example, renewable energy sources in Chile, including our approximately 100 MW solar facility, benefit from an RPS program, and renewable energy sources in Portugal, including our wind assets, benefit from a government regulated feed-in tariff. In Canada, our projects benefit from a long-term power purchase agreement with an entity owned by the government of the province of Ontario. Any adverse change to, or the elimination of, these incentives could have a material adverse effect on our business and our future growth prospects. In Ontario, in December 2019 the government directed the Independent Electricity System Operator of Ontario to solicit feedback from generators on potential cost-lowering opportunities that would reduce electricity rates for consumers while maintaining grid reliability. They indicated that this review might include the triggering of rights within existing power purchase agreements, as well as negotiating changes to existing power purchase agreements, which in either case could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are also subject to laws and regulations that are applicable to business entities generally, including local, state and federal tax laws. As discussed in Government Incentives and Legislation within Item 1. Business, on December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Act, which contains several provisions that positively and negatively impact our business and operations. If any of the laws or governmental regulations or policies that support renewable energy change, or if we are subject to changes to other existing laws or regulations or new laws or regulation that impact our tax position, increase our compliance costs, are burdensome or otherwise negatively impact our business, such new or changed laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nInternational operations subject us to political and economic uncertainties.\nOur portfolio consists of renewable energy facilities located in the United States (including Puerto Rico), Canada, the United Kingdom, Chile, Spain, Portugal and Uruguay. In addition, we could decide to expand our presence in our existing\ninternational markets or further our expansion into new international markets. As a result, our activities are and will be subject to significant political and economic uncertainties that may adversely affect our operating and financial performance. These uncertainties include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022the risk of a change in renewable power pricing policies, possibly with retroactive effect;\n\u2022political and economic instability;\n\u2022measures restricting the ability of our facilities to access the grid to deliver electricity at certain times or at all;\n\u2022the macroeconomic climate and levels of energy consumption in the countries where we have operations;\n\u2022the comparative cost of other sources of energy;\n\u2022changes in taxation policies and/or the regulatory environment in the countries in which we have operations, including reductions to renewable power incentive programs;\n\u2022the imposition of currency controls and foreign exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022high rates of inflation;\n\u2022protectionist and other adverse public policies, including local content requirements, import/export tariffs, increased regulations or capital investment requirements;\n\u2022changes to land use regulations and permitting requirements;\n\u2022risk of nationalization or other expropriation of private enterprises and land, including creeping regulation that reduces the value of our facilities or governmental incentives associated with renewable energy;\n\u2022difficulty in timely identifying, attracting and retaining qualified technical and other personnel;\n\u2022difficulty competing against competitors who may have greater financial resources and/or a more effective or established localized business presence;\n\u2022difficulties with, and extra-normal costs of, recruiting and retaining local individuals skilled in international business operations;\n\u2022difficulty in developing any necessary partnerships with local businesses on commercially acceptable terms; and\n\u2022being subject to the jurisdiction of courts other than those of the United States, which courts may be less favorable to us.\nIn addition, we may be unable to adjust our tariffs or rates as a result of fluctuations in prices above the regulated recognized inflation of raw materials, exchange rates, labor and subcontractor costs, or any other variations in the conditions of specific jurisdictions in which our concession-type infrastructure projects are located, which may reduce our profitability.\nThese uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may suffer a significant loss resulting from fraud, bribery, corruption, other illegal acts, inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, or from external events.\nWe may suffer a significant loss resulting from fraud, bribery, corruption, other illegal acts, inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, or from external events, such as security threats affecting our ability to operate. We operate in multiple jurisdictions and it is possible that our operations will expand into new jurisdictions. Doing business in multiple jurisdictions requires us to comply with the laws and regulations of the U.S. government as well as those of various non-U.S. jurisdictions, and the number of jurisdictions in which we are operating has grown in recent years. These laws and regulations may apply to TerraForm Power, Terra LLC, our subsidiaries, our individual directors, officers, employees and third-party contractors and agents. In particular, our non-U.S. operations are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (\u201cFCPA\u201d). The FCPA, among other things, prohibits companies and their officers, directors, employees and third-party agents acting on their behalf from corruptly offering, promising, authorizing or providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purposes of influencing official decisions or obtaining or retaining business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment. The Company and its officers, directors, employees and third-party agents regularly deal with government bodies and government owned and controlled businesses, the employees and representatives of which may be considered foreign officials for purposes of the FCPA. Also, as we make acquisitions, we may expose ourselves to FCPA or other corruption related risks if our due diligence processes are unable to uncover or detect violations of applicable anti-corruption laws.\nWe rely on our infrastructure, controls, systems and personnel, to manage the risk of illegal and corrupt acts or failed systems. We also rely on our employees and certain third parties to comply with our policies and processes as well as applicable laws. Specific programs, policies, standards, methodologies and training have been developed to support the management of these risks. However, the failure to adequately identify or manage these risks could result in direct or indirect financial loss, regulatory censure and/or harm to our reputation. The acquisition of businesses with weak internal controls to manage the risk of illegal or corrupt acts may create additional risk of financial loss, regulatory censure and/or harm to our reputation. In addition, programs, policies, standards, methodologies and training, no matter how well designed, do not provide absolute assurance of effectiveness.\nWe are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and related compliance expenditures and liabilities.\nOur assets are subject to numerous and significant federal, state, local and foreign laws, and other requirements governing or relating to the environment, health and safety. Our facilities could experience incidents, malfunctions and other unplanned events, such as spills of hazardous materials that may result in personal injury, penalties, property or environmental damage.\nOur CSP facilities use regulated thermal \u201cworking fluid\u201d, and any leakage of working fluid from storage basins or otherwise could contaminate local groundwater and be hazardous to the environment. In the event of a leak, we are obligated to report it to local authorities and, depending on the severity of the leak, we may also be required to implement certain decontamination measures. If any such leak is not managed adequately and in accordance with applicable regulation, we may be subject to fines or, in extreme cases, have our operating permits revoked. In 2019, we identified leaks at two of our CSP facilities. These leaks are being remediated and as of the date of the Annual Report we are working with our technical advisors and local regulatory authorities to decontaminate the affected soil. While no enforcement action has been taken against us at this time and we do not expect to incur any liability in respect of the current incident, there is no assurance that we will not face liability for these leaks or any future leaks that may occur.\nIn addition, certain environmental, health and safety laws may result in liability for failure to comply with periodic reporting and other administrative requirements, regardless of fault, concerning contamination at a range of properties, including properties currently or formerly owned, leased or operated by us and properties where we disposed of, or arranged for disposal of, waste and other hazardous materials. In addition, with an increasing global focus and public sensitivity to environmental sustainability and environmental regulation becoming more stringent, we could also be subject to increasing environmental related responsibilities and associated liability. Environmental legislation and permitting requirements may evolve in a manner which will require stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects and a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their directors and employees. As such, the operation of our facilities carries an inherent risk of environmental liability, and may result in our involvement from time to time in administrative and judicial proceedings relating to such matters. These changes may result in increased costs to our operations and may have an adverse impact on prospects for growth of our business. While we have implemented environmental management and health and safety programs designed to continually improve environmental, health and safety performance, there is no assurance that such liabilities including significant required capital expenditures, as well as the costs for complying with environmental laws and regulations, will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nHarming of protected species can result in curtailment of wind power plant operations, monetary fines and negative publicity.\nThe operation of wind power plants can adversely affect endangered, threatened or otherwise protected animal species, as the turbine blades travel at a high speed and may strike flying animals (such as birds or bats) that happen to travel into the path of spinning blades. Our wind power plants periodically strike and kill flying animals, including, occasionally, endangered or protected species. As a result, we observe industry guidelines and comply with regulator approved incidental take permits and governmentally recommended best practices to avoid harm to such protected species. This includes but is not limited to avoiding erecting structures that could be used as perches, minimizing guy wires that may kill birds or bats in flight, and avoiding lighting that may attract protected species to the wind turbines at night. In addition, we attempt to reduce the attractiveness of a site to predatory birds through regular site maintenance (e.g., mowing and removal of animal and bird carcasses, among other things).\nWhere possible, we obtain permits for incidental taking of protected species. We hold such permits for some of our wind power plants, particularly in Hawaii, where several species are endangered and protected by law. In addition, we monitor on an ongoing basis U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service and state policy and rulemakings for species relevant to our projects, and will seek permits as appropriate. In 2019, we received approval for amended federal and state incidental take permits for one wind power plant in Hawaii, where, based on standardized monitoring, endangered species mortality exceeded prior estimates and the prior permitted limit on such takings. We are now in full compliance.\nExcessive taking of protected species could result in requirements to implement mitigation strategies, including potentially costly modification of operations and/or substantial monetary fines and could also result in negative publicity. For example, our wind power plants in Hawaii are subject to curtailment (i.e., reduction in operations) if excessive taking of protected species is detected through monitoring. Curtailments to protect endangered bats has been implemented at our Hawaiian facilities, but not currently at levels that materially reduce electricity generation or revenues. Such curtailments require, among other things, reduced nighttime operations and also require that operations be limited to times when wind speeds are high enough to prevent bats from flying into a wind power plant\u2019s blades. We cannot guarantee that such curtailments, or\nany monetary fines that are levied or negative publicity that we receive as a result of incidental taking of protected species, will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks that are beyond our control, including but not limited to acts of terrorism or acts of war, natural disasters, hostile cyber intrusions, theft or other catastrophic events, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur renewable energy facilities, or those that we otherwise acquire in the future, may be targets of terrorist activities that could cause environmental repercussions and/or result in full or partial disruption of the facilities\u2019 ability to generate electricity. Hostile cyber intrusions, including those targeting information systems as well as electronic control systems used at the facilities and for the related distribution systems, could severely disrupt business operations and result in loss of service to customers, as well as create significant expense to repair security breaches or system damage.\nFurthermore, certain of our renewable energy facilities are located in active earthquake zones. The occurrence of a natural disaster, such as an earthquake, hurricane, lightning, flood or localized extended outages of critical utilities or transportation systems, or any critical resource shortages, affecting us could cause a significant interruption in our business, damage or destroy our facilities or those of our suppliers or the manufacturing equipment or inventory of our suppliers.\nAdditionally, certain of our renewable energy facilities and equipment are at risk for theft and damage. For example, we are at risk for copper wire theft, especially at our solar generation facilities, due to an increased demand for copper in the United States and internationally. Theft of copper wire or solar panels can cause significant disruption to our operations for a period of months and can lead to operating losses at those locations. Damage to wind turbine equipment may also occur, either through natural events such as lightning strikes that damage blades or in-ground electrical systems used to collect electricity from turbines, or through vandalism, such as gunshots into towers or other generating equipment. Such damage can cause disruption of operations for unspecified periods, which may lead to operating losses at those locations.\nOther catastrophic events, such as pandemic diseases, may also disrupt our business operations. For example, the recent outbreak of the COVID-19 coronavirus has resulted in closures of manufacturing facilities, travel restrictions, disruptions to supply chains and disruptions to workplaces as employees and contractors cease to be available to perform critical work functions. A prolonged disruption could limit the availability of certain parts required to operate our facilities and adversely impact the ability of our LTSA contractors and other service providers to service our equipment, which may result in operational delays. It could also adversely impact our efforts to repower certain facilities, causing important construction milestones to be missed.\nAny such terrorist acts, environmental repercussions or disruptions, natural disasters, theft incidents or other catastrophic events could result in a significant decrease in revenues or significant reconstruction, remediation or replacement costs, beyond what could be recovered through insurance policies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA cyberattack or other failure of our communications and technology infrastructure and systems could have a material adverse impact on us.\nWe rely on information technology systems for secure storage, processing and transmission of sensitive electronic data and other proprietary information for the efficient operation of its renewable energy facilities and corporate operations. In light of this, we may be subject to material cyber security risks or other breaches of information technology security intended to obtain unauthorized access to our proprietary information and that of our business partners, destroy data or disable, degrade, or sabotage these systems through the introduction of computer viruses, fraudulent emails, cyberattacks and other means, and such breaches could originate from a variety of sources including our own employees or unknown third parties. There can be no assurance that measures implemented to protect the integrity of these systems will provide adequate protection, and any such breach could go undetected for an extended period of time. If these information technology systems are impacted by a cyberattack or cyber-intrusion, our operations or capabilities could be interrupted or diminished and important information could be lost, deleted, misused or stolen, which could have a negative impact on our renewable energy facilities, operating results and revenues or which could cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities, reputational damage and regulatory penalties, or incur costs and expenses to repair, replace or enhance affected systems, including costs related to cyber security for our renewable energy facilities and technology systems.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 coronavirus could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition and/or cash flows.\nWhile the impact on our business from the recent outbreak of the COVID-19 coronavirus is unknown at this time and difficult to predict, various aspects of our business could be adversely affected by it. While there are many unknowns as to the\nduration and severity of the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak, in 2020 as of the date of this Annual Report it has caused significant volatility in global markets, including the market price of our securities. Any prolonged and uncontained outbreak of the COVID-19 coronavirus could result in the imposition of quarantines or closures of office spaces, travel and transportation restrictions and/or import and export restrictions, any of which could contribute to a general slowdown in the global economy, and adversely impact our ability to operate our business and the businesses of our customers and counterparties, any of which could have a materially adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, governmental authorities may recommend or impose other measures that could cause significant disruptions to our business operations in the regions most impacted by the coronavirus, including our headquarters in New York City. Any of the foregoing events or other unforeseen consequences of public health problems could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies, and other obligations regarding privacy, data protection, and other matters.\nWe are subject to federal, state, and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security, and transfer of customer, employee, and business partner personally identifiable information, including the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which came into effect in May 2018. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information between one company and its subsidiaries, and among the subsidiaries and other parties with which we have commercial relations. The introduction of new products or expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions may subject us to additional laws and regulations. Foreign data protection, privacy, and other laws and regulations, including GDPR, can be more restrictive than those in the United States. These U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations, including GDPR which can be enforced by private parties or government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations, including GDPR, are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. These existing and proposed laws and regulations can be costly to comply with and can delay or impede the development of new products, result in negative publicity, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, and subject us to inquiries or investigations, claims or other remedies, including fines, which may be significant, or demands that we modify or cease existing business practices.\nA failure by us, our suppliers, or other parties with whom we do business to comply with posted privacy policies or with other federal, state, or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations, including GDPR, in effect since May 2018, could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur use and enjoyment of real property rights for our renewable energy facilities may be adversely affected by the rights of lienholders and leaseholders that are superior to those of the grantors of those real property rights to us.\nRenewable energy facilities generally are and are likely to be located on land occupied by the facility pursuant to long-term easements and leases. The ownership interests in the land subject to these easements and leases may be subject to mortgages securing loans or other liens (such as tax liens) and other easement and lease rights of third parties (such as leases of oil or mineral rights) that were created prior to the facility\u2019s easements and leases. As a result, the facility\u2019s rights under these easements or leases may be subject, and subordinate, to the rights of those third parties. We perform title searches and obtain title insurance to protect ourselves against these risks. Such measures may, however, be inadequate to protect us against all risk of loss of our rights to use the land on which our renewable energy facilities are located, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNegative public or community response to renewable energy facilities could adversely affect our acquisition of new facilities and the operation of our existing facilities.\nNegative public or community response to solar, wind and other renewable energy facilities could adversely affect our ability to acquire and operate our facilities. Our experience is that such opposition subsides over time after renewable energy facilities are completed and are operating, but there are cases where opposition, disputes and even litigation continue into the operating period and could lead to curtailment of a facility\u2019s operations and potentially costly litigation settlements.\nThe seasonality of our operations may affect our liquidity.\nWe need to maintain sufficient financial liquidity to absorb the impact of seasonal variations in energy production or other significant events. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from our operating activities, and the cash retained for working capital purposes out of the gross proceeds of financing activities as well as our borrowing capacity under our existing credit facilities, subject to any conditions required to draw under such existing credit facilities. Our results of\noperations may fluctuate significantly for various reasons, mostly related to economic incentives, weather patterns, forced outages (e.g. curtailments or grid related), major unplanned maintenance outages and price fluctuations related to seasonal generation. For instance, the amount of electricity and revenues generated by our solar generation facilities is dependent, in part, on the amount of sunlight, or irradiation where the facilities are located. Due to shorter daylight hours in the winter months which results in less irradiation, the generation produced by these facilities will vary depending on the season. The electricity produced and revenues generated by a wind power plant depend heavily on wind conditions, which are variable and difficult to predict. Operating results for wind power plants vary significantly from period to period depending on the wind conditions during the periods in question.\nIf we fail to adequately manage the fluctuations in the timing of distributions from our renewable energy facilities, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially affected. The seasonality of our energy production may create increased demands on our working capital reserves and borrowing capacity under our existing credit facilities during periods where cash generated from operating activities are lower. In the event that our working capital reserves and borrowing capacity under our existing credit facilities are insufficient to meet our financial requirements, or in the event that the restrictive covenants in our existing credit facilities restrict our access to such facilities, we may require additional equity or debt financing to maintain our solvency. Additional equity or debt financing may not be available when required or available on commercially favorable terms or on terms that are otherwise satisfactory to us, in which event our financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to our Financing Activities\nWe have incurred substantial indebtedness and may in the future incur additional substantial indebtedness, which may limit our ability to grow our business, reduce our financial flexibility and otherwise may have a material negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have incurred substantial corporate and project-level indebtedness and may incur additional substantial indebtedness in the future. This substantial indebtedness has certain consequences on our business, results of operations and financial condition, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to, respond to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the competitive environment and business in which we operate;\n\u2022limiting our ability to borrow additional amounts to fund our growth or otherwise meet our obligations;\n\u2022limiting our ability to refinance or replace existing indebtedness on favorable terms or at all until the expiration or termination thereof;\n\u2022requiring us to dedicate a significant portion of our revenues to pay the principal of and interest on our indebtedness; and\n\u2022magnifying the impact of fluctuations in our cash flows on cash available for the payment of distributions to the holders of our Common Stock.\nAs a result of these consequences, our substantial indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to operating and financial restrictions through covenants in our corporate and project-level loan, debt and security agreements that may limit our operational activities or limit our ability to raise additional indebtedness.\nWe are subject to operating and financial restrictions through covenants in our corporate and project-level loan, debt and security agreements. These restrictions prohibit or limit our ability to, among other things, incur additional debt, provide guarantees for indebtedness, grant liens, dispose of assets, liquidate, dissolve, amalgamate, consolidate or effect corporate or capital reorganizations, and declare distributions. A financial covenant in our corporate revolver limits the overall corporate indebtedness that we may incur to a multiple of our cash available for debt service, which may limit our ability to obtain additional financing, withstand downturns in our business and take advantage of business and development opportunities. If we breach our covenants, our corporate Revolver or senior notes may be terminated or come due and such event may cause our credit rating to deteriorate and subject us to higher interest and financing costs. We may also be required to seek additional debt financing on terms that include more restrictive covenants, require repayment on an accelerated schedule or impose other obligations that limit our ability to grow our business, acquire assets or take other actions that we might otherwise consider appropriate or desirable.\nUncertainty regarding LIBOR may adversely affect the interest we pay under certain of our indebtedness.\nIn July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. Currently, it is not possible to predict the exact transitional arrangements for calculating applicable reference rates that may be made in the U.K., the U.S., the Eurozone or elsewhere given that a number of outcomes are possible, including the cessation of the publication of one or more reference rates. To the extent LIBOR is not available, we do not anticipate alternative calculations will be materially different from what would have been calculated under LIBOR. Additionally, no mandatory prepayment or redemption provisions would be triggered under our loan documents in the event that the LIBOR rate is not available. It is possible, however, that any new reference rate that applies to our LIBOR-indexed debt could be different than any new reference rate that applies to our LIBOR-indexed derivative instruments. We anticipate managing this difference and any resulting increased variable-rate exposure through modifications to our debt and/or derivative instruments however, future market conditions may not allow immediate implementation of desired modifications and/or we may incur significant associated costs.\nChanges in our credit ratings may have an adverse effect on our financial position and ability to raise capital.\nThe credit rating assigned to the Company or any of our subsidiaries\u2019 debt securities may be changed or withdrawn entirely by the relevant rating agency. A lowering or withdrawal of such ratings may have an adverse effect on our financial position and ability to raise capital.\nRisks Related to our Growth Strategy\nThe growth of our business depends on locating and acquiring interests in attractive renewable energy facilities at favorable prices and with favorable financing terms. Additionally, even if we consummate such acquisitions and financings on terms that we believe are favorable, such acquisitions may in fact result in a decrease in cash available for distribution per share.\nThe following factors, among others, could affect the availability of attractive renewable energy facilities to grow our business and distributions per share:\n\u2022competing bids for a renewable energy facility;\n\u2022fewer third party acquisition opportunities than we expect, including pursuant to existing call rights of the Company;\n\u2022risk relating to our ability to successfully acquire ROFO assets from Brookfield and its affiliates; and\n\u2022our access to tax equity financing or the capital markets for equity and debt (including project-level debt) at a cost and on terms that would be accretive to our stockholders.\nEven if we consummate acquisitions that we believe will be accretive to our distributions per share, those acquisitions may in fact result in a decrease in distributions per share as a result of incorrect assumptions in our evaluation of such acquisitions, unforeseen consequences or external events beyond our control.\nOur acquisition strategy exposes us to substantial risk.\nOur acquisition of renewable energy facilities or of companies that own and operate renewable energy facilities is subject to substantial risk, including but not limited to the failure to identify material problems during due diligence (for which we may not be indemnified post-closing), the risk of over-paying for assets (or not making acquisitions on an accretive basis), the ability to obtain or retain customers and, if the renewable energy facilities are in new markets, the risks of entering markets where we have limited experience. While we perform due diligence on prospective acquisition targets, we may not be able to discover all potential operational deficiencies in such renewable energy facilities. In addition, our expectations for the operating performance of newly constructed renewable energy facilities as well as those under construction may be based on assumptions and estimates made without the benefit of operating history. However, the ability of these renewable energy facilities to meet our performance expectations is subject to the risks inherent in newly constructed renewable energy facilities and the construction of such facilities, including, but not limited to, degradation of equipment in excess of our expectations, system failures and outages. Future acquisitions may not perform as expected or the returns from such acquisitions may not support the financing utilized to acquire them or maintain them. Furthermore, integration and consolidation of acquisitions requires substantial human, financial and other resources and may divert management\u2019s attention from our existing business concerns and any such integration may not be successful. As a result, the consummation of acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to effectively identify or consummate any future acquisitions. Additionally, even if we consummate acquisitions, such acquisitions may in fact result in a decrease in cash available for distribution. In addition, we may engage in asset dispositions or other transactions that result in a decrease in our cash available for distribution.\nFuture acquisition opportunities for renewable energy facilities are limited and there is substantial competition for the acquisition of these assets. Moreover, while Brookfield and its affiliates will grant us a ROFO with respect to the projects in the right of first offer portfolio as a result of the Merger and Sponsorship Transaction, there is no assurance that we will be able to acquire or successfully integrate any such projects. We will compete with other companies for future acquisition opportunities from Brookfield and its affiliates and third parties.\nCompetition for acquisitions may increase our cost of making acquisitions or cause us to refrain from making acquisitions at all. Some of our competitors are much larger than us with substantially greater resources, have access to lower costs of capital, or have lower return targets. These companies may be able to pay more for acquisitions and may be able to identify, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of assets than our resources, costs of capital or return targets permit. In addition, our competitors may be to make acquisitions for renewable energy facilities having less desirable economic returns or higher risk profiles than we believe suitable for our business plan and investment strategy. If we are unable to identify and consummate future acquisitions, it will impede our ability to execute our growth strategy and limit our ability to increase the amount of distributions paid to holders of our Common Stock. In addition, as we continue to manage our liquidity profile, we may engage in asset dispositions, or incur additional project-level debt, which may result in a decrease in our CAFD. Even if we consummate acquisitions that we believe will be accretive, those acquisitions may in fact result in a decrease in CAFD as a result of incorrect assumptions in our evaluation of such acquisitions, unforeseen consequences or other external events beyond our control. Furthermore, if we consummate any future acquisitions, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly, and stockholders will generally not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in determining the application of these funds and other resources.\nCertain assets are owned, or in the future may be acquired, alongside minority investors who are entitled to influence certain management decisions and our interests and those of any such minority investors may differ.\nWe own certain assets alongside minority investors, in which we do not have complete control over management decisions as a result of the agreements governing such investments. For example, minority investor approval may be required for us to receive distributions of funds from these assets or to sell, pledge, transfer, assign or otherwise convey our interest in such assets. Alternatively, our minority investors may have rights of first refusal or rights of first offer in the event of a proposed sale or transfer of our interests in such assets. The interests of any minority investor may not be aligned with ours and they may seek to exercise consent rights that may inhibit our ability to manage the asset as we see fit. As we look to from time to time recycle capital, we may deem it advisable to opportunistically sell a minority interest in one or more assets, and such new minority investors may negotiate consent rights or other governance arrangements that restrict our ability to control all management decisions in respect of such assets.\nOur ability to grow and make acquisitions with cash on hand may be limited by our cash distribution policy.\nIn the future, we intend to pay distributions to our stockholders each quarter and to rely primarily upon external financing sources, including the issuance of debt and equity securities to fund our acquisitions and growth capital expenditures. We may be precluded from pursuing otherwise attractive acquisitions if the projected short-term cash flow from the acquisition or investment is not adequate to service the capital raised to fund the acquisition or investment. As such, our growth may not be as fast as that of businesses that reinvest more available cash from operations.\nWe may not have access to all operating wind and solar acquisitions that Brookfield identifies.\nOur ability to grow through acquisitions depends on Brookfield\u2019s ability to identify and present us with acquisition opportunities. Brookfield has designated TerraForm Power, subject to certain exceptions, as its primary vehicle to acquire operating wind and solar assets in North America and Western Europe. However, Brookfield\u2019s obligations to the Company under the Relationship Agreement are subject to a number of exceptions and Brookfield has no obligation to source acquisition opportunities specifically for us. There are a number of factors which could materially and adversely impact the extent to which suitable acquisition opportunities are made available to us by Brookfield, for example:\n\u2022It is an integral part of Brookfield\u2019s strategy to pursue the acquisition or development of renewable power assets through consortium arrangements with institutional investors, strategic partners and/or financial sponsors and to form partnerships (including private funds, joint ventures and similar arrangements) to pursue acquisitions on a specialized basis. In certain circumstances, acquisitions of operating wind and solar assets in our primary jurisdictions may be made by other Brookfield vehicles, either with or instead of us.\n\u2022The same professionals within Brookfield\u2019s organization that are involved in sourcing acquisitions that are suitable for us are often responsible for sourcing opportunities for vehicles, consortiums and partnerships referred to above, as well as having other responsibilities within Brookfield\u2019s broader asset management business. Limits on the availability of such individuals will likewise result in a limitation on the availability of acquisition opportunities for us.\n\u2022Brookfield will only recommend acquisition opportunities that it believes are suitable and appropriate for us. The question of whether a particular acquisition is suitable and appropriate is highly subjective and is dependent on a number of factors including an assessment by Brookfield of our liquidity position, the risk and return profile of the opportunity, and other factors. If Brookfield determines that an opportunity is not suitable or appropriate for us, it may still pursue such opportunity on its own behalf, or on behalf of a Brookfield-sponsored vehicle.\nOur ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations and growth may be limited.\nWe may need to arrange additional financing to fund all or a portion of the cost of acquisitions, including potential contingent liabilities and other aspects of our operations. Our ability to arrange additional financing or otherwise access the debt or equity capital markets, either at the corporate-level or at a non-recourse project-level subsidiary, may be limited. Any limitations on our ability to obtain financing may have an adverse effect on our business, or growth prospects or our results of operations. Additional financing, including the costs of such financing, will be dependent on numerous factors, including:\n\u2022general economic and capital market conditions, including the then-prevailing interest rate environment;\n\u2022credit availability from banks and other financial institutions;\n\u2022investor confidence in us, our partners, our Sponsor, and the regional wholesale power markets;\n\u2022our financial performance and the financial performance of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022our level of indebtedness and compliance with covenants in debt agreements;\n\u2022our ability to file SEC reports on a timely basis and obtain audited project-level financial statements;\n\u2022maintenance of acceptable credit ratings or credit quality, including maintenance of the legal and tax structure of the project-level subsidiary upon which the credit ratings may depend;\n\u2022our cash flows; and\n\u2022provisions of tax and securities laws that may impact raising capital.\nWe may not be successful in obtaining additional financing for these or other reasons. Furthermore, we may be unable to refinance or replace non-recourse financing arrangements or other credit facilities on favorable terms or at all upon the expiration or termination thereof. Our failure, or the failure of any of our renewable energy facilities, to obtain additional capital or enter into new or replacement financing arrangements when due may constitute a default under such existing indebtedness and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Inherent in an Investment in TerraForm Power, Inc.\nWe may not be able to pay cash distributions to holders of our Common Stock in the future.\nThe amount of our cash available for distribution principally depends upon the amount of cash we generate from our operations, which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on, among other things:\n\u2022our ability to realize the expected benefits from Brookfield\u2019s sponsorship on our business and results of operations;\n\u2022the timing of our ability to complete our audited corporate and project-level financial statements;\n\u2022risks related to our ability to file our annual and quarterly reports with the SEC on a timely basis and to satisfy the requirements of the Nasdaq Global Select Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d);\n\u2022our ability to integrate acquired assets and realize the anticipated benefits of these acquired assets;\n\u2022The willingness and ability of the counterparties to our offtake agreements to fulfill their obligations under such agreements;\n\u2022price fluctuations, termination provisions and buyout provisions related to our offtake agreements;\n\u2022our ability to enter into contracts to sell power on acceptable terms as our offtake agreements expire;\n\u2022delays or unexpected costs during the completion of construction of certain renewable energy facilities we intend to acquire;\n\u2022our ability to successfully identify, evaluate and consummate acquisitions;\n\u2022government regulation, including compliance with regulatory and permit requirements and changes in market rules, rates, tariffs, tax law, environmental laws and political climate;\n\u2022operating and financial restrictions placed on us and our subsidiaries related to agreements governing our indebtedness and other agreements of certain of our subsidiaries and project-level subsidiaries generally;\n\u2022our ability to borrow additional funds and access capital markets on favorable terms or at all, as well as our substantial indebtedness and the possibility that we may incur additional indebtedness going forward;\n\u2022our ability to compete against traditional and renewable energy companies;\n\u2022hazards customary to the power production industry and power generation operations such as unusual weather conditions, catastrophic weather-related or other damage to facilities, unscheduled generation outages, maintenance or repairs, interconnection problems or other developments, environmental incidents, or electric transmission constraints and the possibility that we may not have adequate insurance to cover losses as a result of such hazards;\n\u2022our ability to expand into new business segments or new geographies;\n\u2022seasonal variations in the amount of electricity our wind and solar plants produce, and fluctuations in wind and solar resource conditions; and\n\u2022our ability to operate our businesses efficiently, manage capital expenditures and costs tightly, manage litigation, manage risks related to international operations and generate earnings and cash flow from our asset-based businesses in relation to our debt and other obligations.\nAs a result of all these factors, we cannot guarantee that we will have sufficient cash generated from operations to pay a specific level of cash distributions to holders of our Common Stock. Furthermore, holders of our Common Stock should be aware that the amount of cash available for distribution depends primarily on our cash flow, and is not solely a function of profitability, which is affected by non-cash items. We may incur other expenses or liabilities during a period that could significantly reduce or eliminate our cash available for distribution and, in turn, impair our ability to pay distributions to holders of our Common Stock during the period. We are a holding company and our ability to pay distributions on our Common Stock is limited by restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay distributions or make other distributions to us, including restrictions under the terms of the agreements governing project-level financing. Our project-level financing agreements prohibit distributions to us unless certain specific conditions are met, including the satisfaction of financial ratios and the absence of payment or covenant defaults.\nFurthermore, we have issued additional equity securities from time to time, including in connection with our acquisition of our European Platform and for general corporate purposes, and we may issue additional equity securities in the future. The payment of distributions on these additional equity securities may increase the risk that we will be unable to maintain or increase our per share distribution. There are no limitations in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (other than a specified number of authorized shares) on our ability to issue equity securities, including securities ranking senior to our Common Stock. The incurrence of bank borrowings or other debt by Terra Operating LLC or by our project-level subsidiaries to finance our growth strategy will result in increased interest expense and the imposition of additional or more restrictive covenants which, in turn, may impact the cash distributions we distribute to holders of our Common Stock.\nFinally, distributions to holders of our Common Stock will be paid at the discretion of our Board.\nOur payout ratio has recently exceeded our long-term target and, in some periods, our CAFD. If this were to continue, it could impact our ability to maintain or grow our distributions.\nOur payout ratio is a measure of our ability to make cash distributions to stockholders. We target a long-term payout ratio of 80 to 85% of CAFD. From time to time, our payout ratio may exceed 100%, for example, during periods of lower generation or lower merchant power prices or combination thereof, or repowering or operational maintenance investment periods. Because our business is primarily dependent on generation conditions and merchant power prices, as well as other factors beyond our control, it is possible that our payout ratio may remain above 100% for a sustained period. If this were to occur, it could impact our ability to maintain or grow our distributions to stockholders in line with our stated targets.\nCertain of our stockholders have accumulated large concentrations of holdings of our Common Stock, which among other things, may impact the liquidity of our Common Stock.\nIn addition to Brookfield, certain of our stockholders hold large positions in our Common Stock and new or existing stockholders may accumulate large positions in our Common Stock, which may impact the liquidity of shares of our Common Stock. In the event that stockholders hold these large positions in shares of our Common Stock not owned by Brookfield this concentration of ownership may reduce the liquidity of our Common Stock and may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a future change in control of our company or discouraging others from making tender offers for our shares, which could depress the price per share a bidder might otherwise be willing to pay.\nWe are a holding company and our primary asset is our direct and indirect interest in Terra LLC, and we are accordingly dependent upon distributions from Terra LLC and its subsidiaries to pay distributions and taxes and other expenses.\nTerraForm Power is a holding company and has no material assets other than its direct and indirect ownership of membership interests in Terra LLC, a holding company that has no material assets other than its interest in Terra Operating LLC, whose sole material assets are interests in holding companies that directly or indirectly own the renewable energy facilities that comprise our portfolio and the renewable energy facilities that we subsequently acquire. TerraForm Power, Terra LLC and Terra Operating LLC have no independent means of generating revenue. We intend to cause Terra Operating LLC\u2019s\nsubsidiaries to make distributions to Terra Operating LLC and, in turn, make distributions to Terra LLC, and, Terra LLC, in turn, to make distributions to TerraForm Power in an amount sufficient to cover all applicable taxes payable and distributions, if any, declared by us. To the extent that we need funds to pay a quarterly cash distribution to holders of our Common Stock or otherwise, and Terra Operating LLC or Terra LLC is restricted from making such distributions under applicable law or regulation or is otherwise unable to provide such funds (including as a result of Terra Operating LLC\u2019s operating subsidiaries being unable to make distributions, such as due to defaults in project-level financing agreements), it could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and limit our ability to pay distributions to holders of our Common Stock.\nMarket interest rates may have an effect on the value of our Common Stock.\nOne of the factors that influences the price of shares of our Common Stock will be the effective distribution yield of such shares (i.e., the yield as a percentage of the then market price of our shares) relative to market interest rates. An increase in market interest rates may lead prospective purchasers of shares of our Common Stock to expect a higher distribution yield. If market interest rates increase and we are unable to increase our distribution in response, including due to an increase in borrowing costs, insufficient cash available for distribution or otherwise, investors may seek alternative investments with higher yield, which would result in selling pressure on, and a decrease in the market price of, our Common Stock. As a result, the price of our Common Stock may decrease as market interest rates increase.\nThe market price and marketability of our shares may from time to time be significantly affected by numerous factors beyond our control, which may adversely affect our ability to raise capital through future equity financings.\nThe market price of our shares may fluctuate significantly. Many factors may significantly affect the market price and marketability of our shares and may adversely affect our ability to raise capital through equity financings and otherwise materially adversely impact our business. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022price and volume fluctuations in the stock markets generally;\n\u2022significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of registered investment companies, business development companies or companies in our sectors, which may not be related to the operating performance of these companies;\n\u2022changes in our earnings or variations in operating results;\n\u2022changes in regulatory policies or tax law;\n\u2022operating performance of companies comparable to us; and\n\u2022loss of funding sources or the ability to finance or refinance our obligations as they come due.\nInvestors may experience dilution of their ownership interest due to the future issuance of additional shares of our Common Stock.\nWe are in a capital intensive business, and may not have sufficient funds to finance the growth of our business, acquisitions or to support our projected capital expenditures. As a result, we have engaged in, and may require additional funds from further, equity or debt financings, including tax equity financing transactions or sales of preferred shares or convertible debt to complete future acquisitions, expansions and capital expenditures and pay the general and administrative costs of our business. In the future, we may issue our previously authorized and unissued securities, resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of purchasers of our Common Stock offered hereby. Under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, we are authorized to issue 1,200,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock with preferences and rights as determined by our Board. The potential issuance of additional shares of Common Stock or preferred stock or convertible debt may create downward pressure on the trading price of our Common Stock. We may also issue additional shares of our Common Stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for our Common Stock in future public offerings or private placements for capital raising purposes or for other business purposes, potentially at an offering price, conversion price or exercise price that is below the trading price of our Common Stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our Common Stock adversely, the stock price and trading volume of our Common Stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our Common Stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If any of the analysts who may cover us change their recommendation regarding our Common Stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, the price of our Common Stock would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the stock price or trading volume of our Common Stock to decline.\nThe settlement of certain existing litigation will trigger a requirement to issue additional Common Stock to Brookfield.\nWe have agreed pursuant to the Merger and Sponsorship Transaction agreement dated March 6, 2017 among the Company, Orion Holdings and BRE TERP Holdings Inc., to issue additional shares of Common Stock to Brookfield for no additional consideration in respect of the final resolution of certain specified litigation (see Note 20. Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements for a description of such litigation). The number of additional shares of Common Stock to be issued to Brookfield is subject to a pre-determined formula as set forth in the Merger Agreement as described in greater detail in the Company\u2019s Definitive Proxy Statement filed on Schedule 14A with the SEC on September 6, 2017 and will compensate Brookfield for the total amount of losses we incur with respect to such specified litigation. Any shares of Common Stock issued to Brookfield would result in the dilution of the ownership interests of our remaining Class A common stockholders.\nOur failure to achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and share price.\nWe are required to comply with Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the course of preparing our financial statements, and our management is required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for such year. Additionally, our independent registered public accounting firm is required pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis. The rules governing the standards that must be met for our management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation.\nInternal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity\u2019s financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The existence of any material weakness would require management to devote significant time and incur significant expense to remediate any such material weaknesses and management may not be able to remediate any such material weaknesses in a timely manner.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we did not maintain an effective control environment attributable to certain identified material weaknesses. We describe these material weaknesses in Item 9A. Controls and Procedures in this Annual Report. These control deficiencies create a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement to the consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis, and therefore we concluded that the deficiencies represent material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2019.\nThe existence of these or other material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting could also result in errors in our financial statements that could require us to restate our financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and cause stockholders to lose confidence in our reported financial information, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business and stock price.\nA significant portion of our assets consists of long-lived assets, the value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the net carrying value of long-lived assets represented $9.3 billion, or 93%, of our total assets and consisted of renewable energy facilities, intangible assets and goodwill from the acquisition of Saeta. Renewable energy facilities and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate carrying values may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized if the total future estimated undiscounted cash flows expected from an asset are less than its carrying value.\nGoodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually and whenever facts and circumstances indicate that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit that has goodwill is less than its carrying value. An impairment loss is recognized if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. As of December 1, 2019, we performed a qualitative impairment test for the goodwill balance in Saeta of $128.0 million and determined that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair values of the reporting units exceed their carrying amounts. We concluded that further evaluation of impairment was not necessary and goodwill associated with the Saeta acquisition was not impaired at December 31, 2019.\nRisks Related to our Relationship with Brookfield\nWe may not realize the expected benefits of Brookfield sponsorship.\nTerraForm Power and Brookfield are party to certain sponsorship agreements, which include, among other things, for Brookfield to provide strategic and investment management services to us, for Brookfield, subject to certain terms and conditions, to provide us with a right of first offer on certain operating wind and solar assets that are located in North America and Western Europe and developed by persons sponsored by or under the control of Brookfield and for Brookfield to provide TerraForm Power with a $500 million secured revolving credit facility to fund certain acquisitions or growth capital expenditures.\nWe may not realize expected benefits of Brookfield\u2019s management services and the other aspects of the sponsorship arrangements. For example, we may fail to realize expected operational or margin improvements, synergies or other cost savings or reductions, may not achieve expected growth in its portfolio through organic growth or third-party acquisitions and may not acquire assets from Brookfield. We may also not be able to effectively utilize the $500 million revolving credit facility provided by Brookfield for accretive acquisitions or at all. Our failure to realize these aspects of Brookfield sponsorship may have an adverse effect on the price of our Common Stock and on our business, growth and the results of our operations.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d controlled by Brookfield, whose interest in our business may be different from our interests or the interests of other holders of our Common Stock.\nBrookfield owns an approximate 62% interest in TerraForm Power. Pursuant to the terms of the New Terra LLC Agreement (as defined herein), Brookfield is also entitled to IDRs. Cash distributions from Terra LLC are allocated between the holders of the Class A units in Terra LLC and the holders of the IDRs according to a fixed formula. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Brookfield MSA, Brookfield is entitled to certain fixed and variable management fees for services performed for the Company. As a result of these economic rights, Brookfield may have interests in our business that are different from our interests or the interests of the other holders of our Common Stock.\nIn addition, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, if there has been a final resolution of certain specified litigation involving the Company, we have agreed to issue a number of additional Class A shares to Brookfield for no additional consideration based on the amounts paid or accrued by us or any of our affiliates, including Brookfield, with respect to such litigation, calculated in accordance with specified formulas. As a result of this arrangement, Brookfield may have interests in the specified litigation that is different from our interests or the interests of the other holders of our Common Stock.\nBrookfield currently owns interests in, manages and controls, and may in the future own or acquire interests in, manage and/or control, other yield focused publicly listed and private electric power businesses that own clean energy assets and other public and private businesses that own and invest in other real property and infrastructure assets. Brookfield may have conflicts or potential conflicts, including resulting from the operation by Brookfield of its other businesses, including its other yield focused electric power businesses, including with respect to Brookfield\u2019s attention to and management of our business which may be negatively affected by Brookfield\u2019s ownership and/or management of other power businesses and other public and private businesses that it owns, controls or manages.\nFor so long as Brookfield or another entity controls greater than 50% of the total outstanding voting power of our Common Stock, we will be considered a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d for the purposes of the Nasdaq listing requirements. As a \u201ccontrolled company,\u201d we are permitted to opt out of the Nasdaq listing requirements that require (i) a majority of the members of our Board to be independent, (ii) that we establish a compensation committee and a nominating and governance committee, each comprised entirely of independent directors, and (iii) an annual performance evaluation of the nominating and governance and compensation committees. We expect to rely on such exceptions with respect to having a majority of independent directors, establishing a compensation committee or nominating committee and annual performance evaluations of such committees. Brookfield may sell part or all of its stake in the Company, or may have its interest in the Company diluted due to future equity issuances, in each case, which could result in a loss of the \u201ccontrolled company\u201d exemption under the Nasdaq rules. We would then be required to comply with those provisions of the Nasdaq listing requirements on which we currently or in the future may rely upon exemptions.\nBrookfield and its affiliates control the Company and have the ability to designate a majority of the members of our Board.\nPursuant to the governance agreements entered into between the Company and Brookfield, Brookfield has the ability to designate a majority of our Board to our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee for nomination for election by our stockholders. Due to such agreements, and Brookfield\u2019s approximate 62% interest in the Company, the ability of other holders of our Common Stock to exercise control over the corporate governance of the Company will be limited. In addition, due to its approximate 62% interest in the Company, Brookfield has a substantial influence on our affairs and its voting power\nconstitutes a large percentage of any quorum of our stockholders voting on any matter requiring the approval of our stockholders. As discussed in the risk factor entitled \u201cWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d controlled by Brookfield and its affiliates, whose interest in our business may be different from ours or other holders of our Common Stock.\u201d above, Brookfield may hold certain interests that are different from ours or other holders of our Common Stock and there is no assurance that Brookfield will exercise its control over the Company in a manner that is consistent with our interests or those of the other holders of our Common Stock.\nBrookfield\u2019s sponsorship may create significant conflicts of interest that may be resolved in a manner that is not in our best interest or the best interest of our stockholders.\nOur sponsorship arrangements with Brookfield involve relationships that may give rise to conflicts of interest between us and our stockholders, on the one hand, and Brookfield, on the other hand. We rely on Brookfield to provide us with, among other things, strategic and investment management services. Although our sponsorship arrangements require Brookfield to provide us with a Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and General Counsel who are dedicated to us on a full-time basis and have as their primary responsibility the provision of services to us, there is no requirement for Brookfield to act exclusively for us or for Brookfield to provide any specific individuals to us on an ongoing basis.\nIn certain instances, the interests of Brookfield may differ from our interests, including among other things with respect to the types of acquisitions we pursue, the timing and amount of distributions we make, the reinvestment of returns generated by our operations, the use of leverage when making acquisitions and the appointment of certain outside advisers and service providers. Although we believe the requirement for our Conflicts Committee to review and approve any potential conflict transactions between us and Brookfield should mitigate this risk, there can be no assurance that such review and approvals will result in a resolution that is entirely in our best interests or the best interests of our stockholders.\nBrookfield exercises substantial influence over the Company and we are highly dependent on Brookfield.\nWe depend on the management and administration services provided by Brookfield pursuant to the Brookfield MSA. Other than our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and General Counsel, Brookfield personnel and support staff that provide services to us under the Brookfield MSA are not required to have as their primary responsibility the management and administration of us or to act exclusively for us and the Brookfield MSA does not require any specific individuals to be provided to us. Failing to effectively manage our current operations or to implement our strategy could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe departure of some or all of Brookfield\u2019s professionals could prevent us from achieving our objectives.\nWe depend on the diligence, skill and business contacts of Brookfield\u2019s professionals and the information and opportunities they generate during the normal course of their activities. Our future success will depend on the continued service of these individuals, who are not obligated to remain employed with Brookfield. Brookfield has experienced departures of key professionals in the past and may experience departures again in the future, and we cannot predict the impact that any such departures will have on our ability to achieve our objectives. The departure of a significant number of Brookfield\u2019s professionals for any reason, or the failure to appoint qualified or effective successors in the event of such departures, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our objectives.\nThe role of Brookfield, and the relative amount of the Company\u2019s Common Stock that it controls, may change.\nOur arrangements with Brookfield do not require Brookfield to maintain any ownership level in the Company. If Brookfield decides to sell part or all of its stake in the Company, or has its interest in the Company diluted due to future equity issuances, we could lose the benefit of the \u201ccontrolled company\u201d exemption for the purposes of the Nasdaq rules as discussed in the risk factor entitled \u201cWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d controlled by Brookfield, whose interest in our business may be different from ours or other holders of our Class A common stock.\u201d Additionally, if Brookfield\u2019s ownership interest falls below 25%, we would have the right to terminate the Brookfield MSA. Any decision by us to terminate the Brookfield MSA would trigger a termination of the Relationship Agreement. As a result, we cannot predict with any certainty the effect that any change in Brookfield\u2019s ownership would have on the trading price of our shares or our ability to raise capital or make investments in the future.\nOther Risks\nIf we are deemed to be an investment company, we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted, which may make it difficult for us to complete strategic acquisitions or affect combinations.\nIf we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d) our business would be subject to applicable restrictions under the Investment Company Act, which could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated. We believe our company is not an investment company under Section 3(b)(1) of the Investment Company Act because we are primarily engaged in a non-investment company business, and we intend to conduct our operations so that we will not be deemed an investment company. However, if we were to be deemed an investment company, restrictions imposed by the Investment Company Act, including limitations on our capital structure and our ability to transact with affiliates, could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated.\nPotential future delays in the filing of our reports with the SEC, as well as further delays in the preparation of audited financial statements at the project level, could have a material adverse effect.\nIn the past, we were not timely in filing certain of our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and annual reports on Form 10-K with the SEC. During the period of these delays, we received notification letters from Nasdaq that granted extensions to regain compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing requirements, subject to the requirement that we file our SEC reports and hold our annual meeting of stockholders by certain deadlines. While we are now current in our filing of periodic reports under the Exchange Act and are in compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing requirements, in the event that any future periodic report is delayed, there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain further extensions from Nasdaq to maintain or regain compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing requirements with respect to any such delayed periodic report. If we fail to obtain any such further extensions from Nasdaq, our Common Stock would likely be delisted from the Nasdaq.\nThe delay in filing our annual reports on Form 10-K and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and related financial statements has at times impaired our ability to obtain financing and access the capital markets, and to the extent we fail to make timely filings in the future, our access to financing may be impaired. For example, the delayed filing of our periodic reports with the SEC beyond available grace periods would result in the Company losing its eligibility to register the offer and sale of our securities using a short-form registration statement on Form S-3. Additional delays may also negatively impact our ability to obtain project financing and our ability to obtain waivers or forbearances to the extent of any defaults or breaches of project-level financing. An inability to obtaining financing may have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our business, acquire assets through acquisitions or optimize our portfolio and capital structure. Additionally, a delay in audited financial statements may make our Board less comfortable with approving the payment of distributions.\nFinancial statements at the project-level were also delayed over the course of 2016, 2017 and 2018. This delay created defaults under certain of our non-recourse financing agreements, which have been substantially cured or waived as of the date hereof. To the extent any remaining defaults remain uncured or unwaived, or new defaults arise because of future delays in the completion of audited or unaudited financial statements, our subsidiaries may be restricted in their the ability to make distributions to us, or the related lenders may be entitled to demand repayment or enforce their security interests, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, our ability to pay dividends and our ability to comply with corporate-level debt covenants.\nTaxation Risks\nChanges in tax law and practice may have a material adverse effect on the operations of TerraForm Power, the Holding Entities, and the Operating Entities and, as a consequence, the value of TerraForm\u2019s assets.\nThe TerraForm Power structure, including the structure of the Holding Entities and the Operating Entities, is based on prevailing taxation law and practice in the local jurisdictions (such as Canada, Chile, Spain, Portugal, Puerto Rico, the United States, the United Kingdom and Uruguay) in which the TerraForm Power entities operate. TerraForm Power\u2019s provision for income taxes and reporting of tax-related assets and liabilities require significant judgments and the use of estimates. Amounts of tax-related assets and liabilities involve judgments and estimates of the timing and probability of recognition of income, deductions and tax credits, including, but not limited to, estimates for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken and the ability to utilize tax benefit carryforwards, such as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Actual income taxes could vary significantly from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of, among other things, changes in tax laws, guidance or policies, including changes in corporate income tax rates, the financial condition and results of operations of TerraForm Power, and the resolution of audit issues raised by taxing authorities. These factors, including the ultimate resolution of income tax matters, may result in material adjustments to tax-related assets and liabilities, which could materially adversely affect TerraForm Power\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur future tax liability may be greater than expected if we do not generate NOLs sufficient to offset taxable income or if tax authorities challenge certain of our tax positions.\nWe are subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates on our net taxable income. We expect to generate NOL carryforwards that we can use to offset future taxable income. As a result, we do not expect to pay meaningful U.S. federal income tax in the foreseeable future. This estimate is based upon assumptions we have made regarding, among other things, our income, capital expenditures, cash flows, net working capital and cash distributions. Furthermore, the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) or other tax authorities could challenge one or more tax positions we take, such as the classification of assets under the income tax depreciation rules, the characterization of expenses for income tax purposes, the extent to which sales, use or goods and services tax applies to operations in a particular state or the availability of property tax exemptions with respect to our projects. Furthermore, any change in tax law may affect our tax position, including changes in corporate income tax laws, regulations and policies applicable to us. While we expect that our NOLs and NOL carryforwards will be available to us as a future benefit, in the event that they are not generated as expected, are successfully challenged by the IRS (in a tax audit or otherwise) or are subject to future limitations as described below, our ability to realize these benefits may be limited.\nOur ability to use NOLs to offset future income may be limited.\nOur ability to use federal NOLs to offset future taxable income are limited under Internal Revenue Code Section 382. Any NOLs that exceed this yearly limitation may be carried forward and used to offset taxable income for the remainder of the carryforward period (i.e., 20 years from the year in which such NOL was generated for NOLs generated prior to January 1, 2018 and no carryforward limitation for any subsequently generated NOLs).\nDistributions to stockholders may be taxable as distributions.\nIf we make distributions from current or accumulated earnings and profits as computed for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such distributions will generally be taxable to stockholders as ordinary distribution income for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Distributions paid to non-corporate U.S. stockholders will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at preferential rates, provided that certain holding period and other requirements are satisfied. However, it is difficult to predict whether we will generate earnings and profits as computed for U.S. federal income tax purposes in any given tax year, and although we expect that distributions to stockholders may exceed the current and accumulated earnings and profits as computed for U.S. federal income tax purposes and therefore constitute a non-taxable return of capital distribution to the extent of a stockholder\u2019s basis in its shares, this may not occur. In addition, although return-of-capital distributions are generally non-taxable to the extent of a stockholder\u2019s basis in its shares, such distributions will reduce the stockholder\u2019s adjusted tax basis in our shares, which will result in an increase in the amount of gain (or a decrease in the amount of loss) that will be recognized by the stockholder on a future disposition of our shares, and to the extent any return-of-capital distribution exceeds a stockholder\u2019s basis, such distributions will be treated as gain on the sale or exchange of the shares.", "PERMNO": 14831, "SIC": 4911, "TIC": "TERP"}
