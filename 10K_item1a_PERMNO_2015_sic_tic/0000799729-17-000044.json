{"cik": "799729", "company": "PAREXEL INTERNATIONAL CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-08-29", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to other information in this report, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our company and our business. Additional risks not currently known to us or other factors not perceived by us to present significant risk to our business at this time also may impair our business operations.\nRisks Associated with the Merger\nWe may not complete the merger within the time frame we anticipate or at all, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial results and/or operations.\nIn June of 2017, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger pursuant to which West Street Merger Sub, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of West Street Parent, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (which we refer to as Parent) and affiliate of Pamplona Capital Management, LLP, will be merged with and into us, with PAREXEL surviving as a subsidiary of West Street Parent, LLC, which we refer to as the merger. Completion of the merger is subject to a number of closing conditions, including obtaining approval of our stockholders and receipt of required regulatory approvals. Each party\u2019s obligation to consummate the merger is also subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party (subject to certain qualifications and exceptions) and the performance in all material respects of the other party\u2019s covenants under the merger agreement, including, with respect to us, covenants regarding operation of our business prior to closing. In addition, the merger agreement may be terminated under certain specified circumstances, including, but not limited to, by Parent in connection with a change in the recommendation of our Board of Directors or by us to enter into an agreement for a \u201cSuperior Proposal,\u201d as defined in the merger agreement. As a result, we cannot assure you that the merger will be completed, even if our stockholders approve the merger, or that, if completed, it will be exactly on the terms set forth in the merger agreement or within the expected time frame.\nIf the merger is not completed within the expected time frame or at all, we may be subject to a number of material risks. The price of our common stock may decline to the extent that current market prices reflect a market assumption that the merger will be completed. We could be required to reimburse certain expenses of Parent or pay Parent a termination fee of $138 million if the merger agreement is terminated under specific circumstances described in the merger agreement. The failure to complete the merger may result in negative publicity and negatively affect our relationship with our stockholders, employees and clients. We may also be required to devote significant time and resources to litigation related to any failure to complete the merger or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against us to perform our obligations under the merger agreement.\nThe merger agreement provides us with limited remedies in the event of a breach by Parent that results in termination of the merger agreement, including the right to a reverse termination fee payable under certain specified circumstances, as described in the merger agreement. We cannot assure you that a remedy will be available to us in the event of such a breach or that the damages we incur in connection with such breach will not exceed the amount of the reverse termination fee. In addition, Parent requires significant third-party debt financing to complete the merger and in the event that the Parent\u2019s lenders do not provide such debt financing, we may only be entitled to receive the reverse termination fee as provided under the merger agreement.\nThe announcement and pendency of the merger could adversely affect our business, financial results and/or operations.\nOur efforts to complete the merger could cause substantial disruptions in, and create uncertainty surrounding, our business, which may materially adversely affect our results of operation and our business. Uncertainty as to whether the merger will be completed may affect our ability to recruit prospective employees or to retain and motivate existing employees. Employee retention may be particularly challenging while the merger is pending because employees may experience uncertainty about their roles following the merger. A substantial amount of our management\u2019s and employees\u2019 attention is being directed toward the completion of the merger and thus is being diverted from our day-to-day operations. Uncertainty as to our future could adversely affect our business and our relationship with clients and potential clients. For example, clients and other counterparties may defer decisions concerning working with us, or seek to change existing business relationships with us. Changes to or termination of existing business relationships could adversely affect our revenue, earnings and financial condition, as well as the market price of our common stock. The adverse effects of the pendency of the merger could be exacerbated by any delays in completion of the merger or termination of the merger agreement.\nWhile the merger agreement is in effect, we are subject to restrictions on our business activities.\nWhile the merger agreement is in effect, we are subject to restrictions on our business activities, including, among other things, restrictions on our ability to acquire other businesses and assets, dispose of our assets, make investments, enter into certain contracts, repurchase or issue securities, pay dividends, make capital expenditures, take certain actions relating to intellectual property, amend our organizational documents and incur indebtedness. These restrictions could prevent us from pursuing strategic business opportunities, taking actions with respect to our business that we may consider advantageous and responding effectively and/or timely to competitive pressures and industry developments, and may as a result materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn certain instances, the merger agreement requires us to pay a termination fee to Parent, which could affect the decisions of a third party considering making an alternative acquisition proposal.\nUnder the terms of the merger agreement, we may be required to pay Parent a termination fee of $138 million under specified conditions including in the event we terminate the merger agreement to enter into a \u201cSuperior Proposal,\u201d as defined in the merger agreement or in the event Parent terminates the merger agreement following a change in the recommendation of our Board of Directors that our shareholders approve the merger. This payment could affect the structure, pricing and terms proposed by a third party seeking to acquire or merge with us and could discourage a third party from making a competing acquisition proposal, including a proposal that would be more favorable to our stockholders than the merger.\nWe have incurred, and will continue to incur, direct and indirect costs as a result of the merger.\nWe have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs and expenses, including fees for professional services and other transaction costs, in connection with the merger. We must pay substantially all of these costs and expenses whether or not the merger is completed. There are a number of factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of these costs and expenses.\nLegal proceedings in connection with the merger, the outcomes of which are uncertain, could delay or prevent the completion of the merger.\nSince the announcement of the merger, putative class actions have been filed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts in connection with the proposed merger against us, other parties to the merger, and the members of our Board of Directors. The lawsuits allege that the preliminary that the proxy statement violates Section 14(a) and Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act by materially omitting material information related to Company\u2019s projections and the explanation of the analysis of the Company\u2019s financial advisor, among other claims. Among other remedies, the plaintiffs in these lawsuits seek to enjoin the merger. This and other potential legal proceedings could delay or prevent the merger from becoming effective.\nRisks Associated with our Business and Operations\nThe loss, modification, or delay of large or multiple contracts or a strategic partner may negatively impact our financial performance.\nOur clients generally can terminate their contracts with us upon 30 to 120 days' notice or can delay the execution of services. The loss or delay of a large contract or the loss or delay of multiple contracts could adversely affect our operating results, possibly materially. We have in the past experienced large contract cancellations and delays, which have adversely affected our operating results. The loss of a strategic partner could potentially have a material adverse effect on our business and financial statements.\nClients may terminate or delay their contracts for a variety of reasons, including:\n\u2022\nfailure of products being tested to satisfy safety requirements;\n\u2022\nfailure of products being tested to satisfy efficacy criteria;\n\u2022\nproducts having unexpected or undesired clinical results;\n\u2022\nclient cost reductions as a result of budgetary limits or changing priorities;\n\u2022\nclient decisions to forego a particular study, perhaps for economic reasons;\n\u2022\nmerger or potential merger related activities involving the client;\n\u2022\ninsufficient patient enrollment in a study;\n\u2022\ninsufficient investigator recruitment;\n\u2022\nclinical drug manufacturing problems resulting in shortages of the product;\n\u2022\nproduct withdrawal following market launch; and\n\u2022\nshut down of manufacturing facilities.\nUnfavorable economic and financial market conditions could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur ability to attract and retain clients, invest in and grow our business and meet our financial obligations depends on our operating and financial performance, which, in turn, is subject to numerous factors. In addition to factors specific to our business, prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, political and other factors beyond our control can also affect us. For example, if global economic and market conditions, or economic conditions in the United States, Europe or other key markets remain uncertain or deteriorate, demand for our services could decline, and we may experience material adverse impacts on our business, operating results, and financial condition. In this regard, we are exposed to risks associated with any reduced profitability and the potential\nfinancial instability of our clients resulting from disruptions to the demand for health care services and pharmaceuticals and/or in the credit and capital markets. These conditions could cause clients to experience reduced profitability and/or cash flow problems that could lead them to modify, delay, cancel or fail to make payment under contracts with us, including contracts included in our current backlog, which could, in turn, have a negative effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Our business is also affected by local economic environments, including inflation, recession, financial liquidity and currency volatility or devaluation. Political changes, some of which may be disruptive, could interfere with our clients and our activities in a particular location. We cannot anticipate all the ways in which unfavorable economic and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business.\nWe face risks arising from the restructuring of our operations.\nOn January 6, 2017, we approved a plan to restructure our operations to improve the productivity and efficiency of the company, simplify the organization, and streamline decision-making, thereby enhancing client engagement. In May 2017, the Company approved an expansion of the 2017 Restructuring Program. The restructuring initiatives are company-wide. For Fiscal Years 2017 we recorded $41.2 million in restructuring charges, substantially related to the 2017 Restructuring Program, which consisted of employee separation benefits and facility exit costs. The remainder of the charges are expected to be incurred by the end of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018 (\u201cFiscal Year 2018\u201d). These actions are expected to result in pre-tax savings in the range of $85.0 million to $95.0 million, all of which are anticipated to be cash expenditures.\nIn June 2015, we adopted the Margin Acceleration Program and in January 2017, we approved a plan to further restructure our operations to improve the productivity and efficiency of the Company, simplify the organization, and streamline decision-making, thereby enhancing client engagement. For Fiscal Years 2017 and 2016, we recorded $0.5 million and $27.8 million, respectively, in restructuring charges related to the Margin Acceleration Program, which consisted of employee separation benefits and facility exit costs. If we incur additional restructuring charges, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nRestructuring presents significant potential risks of events occurring that could adversely affect us, including a decrease in employee morale, the failure to achieve targeted cost savings and the failure to meet operational targets and customer requirements due to the loss of employees and any work stoppages that might occur.\nThe fixed price nature of our contracts or failure to document changes to work orders could hurt our operating results.\nThe majority of our contracts are fixed price. If we fail to accurately price our contracts, if we experience significant cost overruns that are not recovered from our clients, or if we do not properly document changes to work orders under existing contracts, our gross margins on the contracts would be reduced and we could lose money on contracts. In the past, we have had to commit unanticipated resources to complete projects, resulting in lower gross margins on those projects. We might experience similar situations in the future.\nIf we are unable to attract suitable investigators and volunteers for our clinical trials, our clinical development business might suffer.\nThe clinical research studies we run in our CRS segment rely upon the ready accessibility and willing participation of physician investigators and volunteer subjects. Investigators are typically located at hospitals, clinics or other sites and supervise administration of the study drug to patients during the course of a clinical trial. Volunteer subjects generally include people from the communities in which the studies are conducted, and the rate of completion of clinical trials is significantly dependent upon the rate of participant enrollment.\nOur clinical research development business could be adversely affected if we were unable to attract suitable and willing investigators or volunteers on a consistent basis. If we are unable to obtain sufficient patient enrollment or investigators to conduct clinical trials as planned, we might need to expend substantial additional funds to obtain access to resources or else be compelled to delay or modify our plans significantly. These considerations might result in our inability to successfully achieve projected development timelines as agreed with trial sponsors. In rare cases, it potentially may even lead us to recommend that trial sponsors terminate ongoing clinical trials or development of a product for a particular indication.\nWe rely on third parties and the transportation industry for important services.\nWe depend on third parties to provide us with products and services critical to our business. The failure of any of these third parties to adequately provide the needed products and services including, without limitation, transportation services, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our clinical logistics services and other businesses are also heavily reliant on air travel for transport of clinical trial kits and other material, research products, and people, and a significant disruption to the air travel system, or our access to it, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf our business, including PI, is unable to maintain continuous, effective, reliable and secure operation of its computer hardware, software and internet applications and related tools and functions, its business will be harmed.\nOur business, including PI, involves collecting, managing, manipulating and analyzing large amounts of data and communicating data via the Internet. In our business, we depend on the continuous, effective, reliable and secure operation of computer hardware, software, networks, telecommunication networks, Internet servers and related infrastructure. If the hardware or software malfunctions or access to data by internal research personnel or customers through the Internet is interrupted, our business could suffer. In addition, any sustained disruption in Internet access provided by third parties could adversely impact our business.\nUnauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential data, whether through systems failure or employee negligence, cyber-attacks, fraud or misappropriation, could damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers. Similarly, we could be subject to attempts to gain unauthorized access to or through our information systems, including a cyber-attack by computer programmers and hackers who may develop and deploy viruses, worms or other malicious software programs, process breakdowns, denial-of-service attacks, malicious social engineering or other malicious activities, or any combination of the foregoing. These concerns about security are increased when information is transmitted over the Internet. Threats include cyber-attacks such as computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, and any of these could result in a degradation or disruption of our services or damage to our properties, equipment and data. They could also compromise data security. If such attacks are not detected immediately, their effect could be compounded. Successful attacks in the future could result in negative publicity, significant remediation and recovery costs, legal liability and damage to our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAlthough the computer and communications hardware used in our business is protected through physical and software safeguards, it is still vulnerable to fire, storm, flood, power loss, earthquakes, telecommunications failures, physical or software break-ins, and similar events. And while certain of our operations have appropriate disaster recovery plans in place, we currently do not have redundant facilities everywhere in the world to provide IT capacity in the event of a system failure. In addition, many of the software applications we use, including the PI software products are complex and sophisticated, and could contain data, design or software errors that could be difficult to detect and correct. If PI fails to maintain and further develop the necessary computer capacity and data to support the needs of our PI customers, it could result in a loss of or a delay in revenue and market acceptance. Additionally, significant delays in the planned delivery of system enhancements or inadequate performance of the systems once they are completed could damage our reputation and harm our business.\nFinally, long-term disruptions to infrastructure caused by events such as natural disasters, the outbreak of war, the escalation of hostilities, and acts of terrorism (particularly in areas where we have offices) could adversely affect our businesses. Although we carry property and business interruption insurance, our coverage may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur.\nOur business is subject to international economic, political, and other risks that could negatively affect our results of operations or financial position.\nWe provide most of our services on a worldwide basis. Our service revenue from non-U.S. operations represented approximately 56% and 57% of total consolidated service revenue for Fiscal Year 2017 and Fiscal Year 2016, respectively. More specifically, for Fiscal Year 2017 and Fiscal Year 2016, our service revenue from operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa represented 37% and 39%, respectively, of total consolidated service revenue. Our service revenue from operations in the Asia/Pacific region represented 16% and 14% of total consolidated service revenue for the respective periods. Accordingly, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in a specific country\u2019s or region\u2019s political or economic conditions, including Western Europe, in particular;\n\u2022\nthe outbreak of war or hostilities in specific geographic regions, including the Ukraine, Russia, the Middle East and North Korea;\n\u2022\npotential negative impact from changes in tax laws affecting any repatriation of profits;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;\n\u2022\nunfavorable labor regulations applicable to our European or other international operations;\n\u2022\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates; and\n\u2022\nthe need to ensure compliance with the numerous regulatory and legal requirements applicable to our business in each jurisdiction and to maintain an effective compliance program to ensure compliance.\nOur operating results are impacted by the health of the global and local economies in which we operate. Our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by current and future economic conditions that cause a decline in business and consumer spending, including a reduction in the availability of credit, rising interest rates, financial market volatility and recession.\nOn June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom (\u201cU.K.\u201d) held a referendum in which voters approved a withdrawal from the European Union (\u201cE.U.\u201d), commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit.\u201d 1.9% and 2.3% of our consolidated service revenue was denominated in the Great Britain Pound (\u201cGBP\u201d) in Fiscal Year 2017 and Fiscal Year 2016, respectively. It is expected that the U.K. will initiate a process to leave the E.U. and begin negotiating the terms of the U.K.\u2019s future relationship with the E.U. At this time, it is uncertain what impact this process will have on the economy in Europe, including in the U.K. or on the \u201cGBP\u201d or other European exchange rates. Adverse consequences such as deterioration in economic conditions, volatility in currency exchange rates or adverse changes in regulation could have a negative impact on our results of operations or financial position.\nIf we cannot retain our highly qualified management and technical personnel, our business would be harmed.\nWe rely on the expertise of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Josef H. von Rickenbach, and our President and Chief Operating Officer, Mark A. Goldberg, and it would be difficult and expensive to find qualified replacements who have a comparable level of specialized knowledge of our products and services and the biopharmaceutical outsourcing services industry. While we are a party to an employment agreement with Mr. von Rickenbach, it may be terminated by either party at any time upon notice to the counterparty.\nIn addition, in order to compete effectively, we must attract and retain qualified sales, professional, scientific, and technical operating personnel. Competition for these skilled personnel, particularly those with a medical degree, a Ph.D. or equivalent degrees, or industry specific expertise, is intense. We may not be successful in attracting or retaining key personnel.\nWe have only a limited ability to protect our intellectual property rights, and these rights are important to our success.\nThe proprietary methodologies, analytics, systems, technologies and other intellectual property we develop is important to our success. Existing laws of the various countries in which we provide services or solutions offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights, and the protection in some countries may be very limited. We rely upon a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality policies, nondisclosure agreements, and other contractual arrangements, and copyright and trademark laws, to protect our intellectual property rights. These laws are subject to change at any time and certain agreements might not be fully enforceable, which could further restrict our ability to protect our innovations. Furthermore, our intellectual property rights might not prevent competitors from independently developing services similar to or duplicative of ours or alleging infringement by us of their intellectual property rights in certain jurisdictions. The steps we take in this regard might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property or claims against us for alleged infringement or misappropriation by competitors, former employees or other third parties, and we might not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights. Enforcing our rights might also require considerable time, money and oversight, and we might not be successful in enforcing our rights.\nRisks Associated with our Financial Results\nOur operating results have fluctuated between quarters and years and may continue to fluctuate in the future, which could affect the price of our common stock.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results have varied and will continue to vary in the future as a result of a variety of factors. For example, our income from operations totaled $48.0 million for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2017, $29.9 million for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2017, $60.0 million for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2016 and $53.3 million for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016. Our income from operations for the Fiscal Years ended June 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015 respectively, totaled $191.2 million, $224.0 million and $199.9 million. Factors that cause these variations include:\n\u2022\nthe level of new business authorizations in particular quarters or years;\n\u2022\nthe timing of the initiation, progress, or cancellation of significant projects;\n\u2022\nforeign currency exchange rate fluctuations between quarters or years;\n\u2022\nrestructuring charges;\n\u2022\nthe mix of services offered in a particular quarter or year;\n\u2022\nthe timing of the opening of new offices or internal expansion;\n\u2022\ntiming, costs and the related financial impact of acquisitions;\n\u2022\nthe timing and amount of costs associated with integrating acquisitions;\n\u2022\nthe timing and amount of startup costs incurred in connection with the introduction of new products, services or subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nthe dollar amount of changes in contract scope finalized during a particular period; and\n\u2022\nthe amount of any reserves we are required to record.\nWe do not control many of these factors, such as the timing of cancellations of significant projects and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between quarters or years.\nIf our operating results do not match the expectations of securities analysts and investors, the trading price of our common stock will likely decrease.\nBacklog may not result in revenue.\nOur backlog is not necessarily a meaningful predictor of future results because backlog can be affected by a number of factors, including the size and duration of contracts, many of which are performed over several years. Additionally, as described above, contracts relating to our clinical development business are subject to early termination by the client, and clinical trials can be delayed or canceled for many reasons, including unexpected test results, safety concerns, regulatory developments or economic issues. Also, the scope of a contract can be reduced significantly during the course of a study. If the scope of a contract is revised, the adjustment to backlog occurs when the revised scope is approved by the client. For these and other reasons, we do not fully realize our entire backlog as service revenue.\nOur revenue and earnings are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations, which have substantially affected our operating results.\nOur financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars. Because we conduct a significant portion of our operations in foreign countries, changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have and have had a significant effect on our operating results. Exchange rate fluctuations between local currencies and the U.S. dollar create risk in several ways, including:\n\u2022\nForeign Currency Translation Risk. The revenue and expenses of our foreign operations are generally denominated in local currencies, primarily the Euro and the pound sterling, and are translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. For Fiscal Year 2017 and Fiscal Year 2016, our Euro denominated service revenue accounted for approximately 12.1% and 9.8% of consolidated service revenue, respectively. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates between relevant foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar will affect the translation of foreign results into U.S. dollars for purposes of reporting our consolidated financial results.\n\u2022\nForeign Currency Transaction Risk. We may be subjected to foreign currency transaction risk when our foreign subsidiaries enter into contracts or incur liabilities denominated in a currency other than the foreign subsidiary's functional (local) currency. We also may be subject to foreign currency transaction risk based upon our internal contracts and the extent of work performed in a particular region. To the extent that we are unable to shift the effects of currency fluctuations to our clients, foreign currency exchange losses as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nAlthough we try to limit these risks through the inclusion of exchange rate fluctuation provisions stated in our service contracts or by hedging transaction risk with foreign currency exchange contracts, we do not succeed in all cases. Even in those cases in which we are successful, we may still experience fluctuations in financial results from our operations outside of the United States, and we may not be able to reduce the currency transaction risk associated with our service contracts.\nOur effective income tax rate may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, which may affect our earnings and earnings per share.\nOur quarterly effective income tax rate is influenced by our annual projected profitability in the various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate. Changes in the distribution of profits and losses among taxing jurisdictions may have a significant impact on our effective income tax rate, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our net income and earnings per share. Factors that affect the effective income tax rate include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe requirement to exclude from our quarterly worldwide effective income tax calculations losses in jurisdictions in which no tax benefit can be recognized;\n\u2022\nthe repatriation of foreign earnings to the United States;\n\u2022\nactual and projected full-year pretax income;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws in various taxing jurisdictions;\n\u2022\naudits by taxing authorities; and\n\u2022\nthe establishment of valuation allowances against deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that future tax benefits will not be realized.\nThese changes may cause fluctuations in our effective income tax rate that could cause fluctuation in our earnings and earnings per share, which could affect our stock price.\nOur results of operations may be adversely affected by the results of regulatory tax examinations.\nWe are subject to value added tax, customs tax, sales and use tax, withholding tax, payroll tax, income tax, and other taxes as a result of the operations of our business. The regulators from the various jurisdictions in which we operate periodically perform audits. In the conduct of such audits, we may be required to disclose information of a sensitive nature and, in general, to modify the way we conduct business with our vendors and customers, and our intercompany transfer pricing, as compared to our prior practices, which may affect our business in an adverse manner. We are also regularly subject to, and are currently undergoing, audits by tax authorities in the United States and foreign jurisdictions for prior tax years. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable and we intend to defend our positions through litigation if necessary, the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation is inherently uncertain and could be materially different than that reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Moreover, we could be subject to assessments of substantial additional taxes and/or fines or penalties relating to ongoing or future audits. The adverse resolution of any audits or litigation could have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nOur results of operations may be adversely affected if our goodwill or intangible assets are impaired.\nAs of June 30, 2017, our total assets included $676.1 million of goodwill and net intangible assets. We assess the realizability of our indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill annually as well as whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that these assets may be impaired. These events or changes in circumstances generally include operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset. Our ability to realize the value of the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets will depend on the future cash flows of the underlying businesses. These cash flows may be impacted by how well we have integrated these businesses. If we are not able to realize the value of the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets.\nChanges to our computer operating systems, programs or software could adversely impact our business.\nWe may make changes to our existing computer operating systems, programs and/or software in an effort to increase our operating efficiency and/or deliver better value to our clients. Such changes may cause disruptions to our operations and have an adverse impact on our business in the short term.\nOur business has experienced substantial expansion in the past and such expansion and any future expansion could strain our resources if not properly managed.\nWe have expanded our business substantially in the past. Future rapid expansion could strain our operational, human and financial resources. In order to manage expansion, we must:\n\u2022\ncontinue to improve operating, administrative, and information systems;\n\u2022\naccurately predict future personnel and resource needs to meet client contract commitments;\n\u2022\ntrack the progress of ongoing client projects; and\n\u2022\nattract and retain qualified management, sales, professional, scientific and technical operating personnel.\nIf we do not take these actions and are not able to manage the expanded business, the expanded business may be less successful than anticipated. We may be required to allocate existing or future resources to the expanded business, that in either case, we would have otherwise allocated to another part of our business.\nIf we are unable to successfully execute our acquisition strategies and successfully integrate acquired businesses, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted.\nHistorically our growth strategy has been based in part on our ability to acquire existing businesses, services or technologies. We do not know whether in the future we will be able to:\n\u2022\nidentify suitable businesses or technologies to buy;\n\u2022\ncomplete the purchase of any such businesses or technologies on terms acceptable to us;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully integrate the operations of acquired businesses into our own;\n\u2022\nobtain financing necessary for an acquisition at all or on commercially acceptable terms; or\n\u2022\nretain key personnel and customers of acquired businesses.\nWe compete with other potential buyers for the acquisition of existing businesses and technology. This competition may result in fewer opportunities to purchase companies that are for sale. It may also result in higher purchase prices for the businesses that we want to purchase. We may also spend time and money investigating and negotiating with potential acquisition targets but not complete the transaction. Any future acquisition could involve other risks, including the assumption of additional liabilities and\nexpenses, issuances of potentially dilutive securities or interest-bearing debt, transaction costs, and diversion of management's attention from other business concerns.\nIn addition, if we are unable to successfully integrate an acquired company, the acquisition could lead to disruptions to our business. In July 2014, we acquired ATLAS Medical Services, a provider of clinical research services in Turkey, the Middle East, and North Africa. In October 2014, we acquired ClinIntel, a provider of clinical RTSM services, based in the United Kingdom. In April 2015, we acquired Quantum Solutions India, a provider of specialized pharmacovigilance services, based in Chandigarh, India. In February 2016, we acquired Health Advances, an independent life sciences strategy consulting firm, based in Boston, Massachusetts. On October 3, 2016, we acquired all of the capital stock of privately owned ExecuPharm, Inc. (\"ExecuPharm\"), a leading global functional service provider, based in Pennsylvania. On March 1, 2017, we acquired all of the membership interests of privately owned The Medical Affairs Company, LLC (\"TMAC\"), a leading provider of outsourced medical affairs services to the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device industries. If we fail to integrate any of these businesses, or any businesses that we acquire in the future, it could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe success of our acquisition strategy will depend upon, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022\nassimilate the operations and services or products of the acquired company;\n\u2022\nintegrate acquired personnel;\n\u2022\nretain and motivate key employees;\n\u2022\nretain customers;\n\u2022\nidentify and manage risks facing the acquired company; and\n\u2022\nminimize the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns.\nAcquisitions of companies outside of the United States may also involve additional risks, including assimilating differences in foreign business practices and overcoming language and cultural barriers.\nIn the event that the operations of an acquired business do not meet our performance expectations, we may have to restructure the acquired business or write-off the value of some or all of the assets of the acquired business.\nOur failure to execute our acquisition strategies, including the identification of potential acquisitions, completing targeted acquisitions, and integrating completed acquisitions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Associated with our Industry\nWe depend on the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, either or both of which may suffer in the short or long term.\nOur revenues depend greatly on the expenditures made by the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries in research and development. In some instances, companies in these industries are reliant on their ability to raise capital in order to fund their research and development projects. Accordingly, economic factors and industry trends that affect our clients in these industries also affect our business. If companies in these industries were to reduce the number of research and development projects they conduct or outsource, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, we are dependent upon the ability and willingness of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to continue to spend on research and development and to outsource the services that we provide. We are therefore subject to risks, uncertainties and trends that affect companies in these industries. We have benefited to date from the tendency of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to outsource clinical research projects, but any downturn in these industries or reduction in spending or outsourcing could adversely affect our business. For example, if these companies expanded upon their in-house clinical or development capabilities, they would be less likely to utilize our services.\nPharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have been entering into strategic partnerships with clinical research organizations in recent years. To the extent we are not selected or do not otherwise enter into a strategic partnership with a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company, future business with that company may be limited.\nBecause we depend on a small number of industries and there is a concentration of large clients in those industries, the loss of business from a significant client could harm our business, revenue and financial condition.\nThe loss of, or a material reduction in the business of, a significant client could cause a substantial decrease in our revenue and adversely affect our business and financial condition, possibly materially. In Fiscal Years 2017, 2016, and 2015, our five largest clients accounted for approximately 37%, 40%, and 44% of our consolidated service revenue, respectively. In Fiscal Year 2017, our largest client individually accounted for 12% of our consolidated service revenue, and in Fiscal Year 2016, our largest client individually accounted for 13% of our consolidated service revenue. In Fiscal Year 2017, we expect that a small number of clients\nwill continue to represent a significant part of our consolidated revenue. This concentration may increase as a result of the increasing number of strategic partnerships into which we have been entering with sponsors. Our contracts with these clients generally can be terminated at any time on short notice. We have in the past experienced contract cancellations with significant clients. If we lose clients, we may not be able to attract new ones, and if we lose individual projects, we may not be able to replace them.\nIn addition, the portion of our backlog that consists of large, multi-year awards from strategic partnerships has grown in recent years and this trend may continue in the future. A higher concentration of backlog from strategic partnerships may result in an imbalance across our project portfolio among projects in the start-up phase, which typically generate lower revenue, and projects in later stages, which typically generate higher revenue. This in turn may cause fluctuations in our revenue and profitability from period to period.\nWe face intense competition in many areas of our business; if we do not compete effectively, our business will be harmed.\nThe biopharmaceutical services industry is highly competitive, and we face numerous competitors in many areas of our business. If we fail to compete effectively, we may lose clients, which would cause our business to suffer.\nWe primarily compete against in-house departments of pharmaceutical companies, other full service CROs, small specialty CROs, and, to a lesser extent, universities, teaching hospitals, and other site organizations. Some of the larger CROs against which we compete include QuintilesIMS, Laboratory Corporation of America, Pharmaceutical Product Development Inc., INC research, PRA Health Sciences and Icon plc. In addition, our PC business competes with a large and fragmented group of specialty service providers, including advertising/promotional companies, major consulting firms with pharmaceutical industry groups and smaller companies with pharmaceutical industry focus. PI competes primarily with CROs, information technology companies and other software companies. Some of these competitors, including the in-house departments of pharmaceutical companies, have greater capital, technical and other resources than we have. In addition, our competitors that are smaller specialized companies may compete effectively against us because of their concentrated size and focus.\nIn recent years, a number of the large pharmaceutical companies have established formal or informal alliances with one or more CROs relating to the provision of services for multiple trials over extended time periods. Our success depends in part on successfully establishing and maintaining these alliances. If we fail to do so, our revenue and results of operations could be adversely affected, possibly materially.\nIf we do not keep pace with rapid technological changes, our products and services may become less competitive or obsolete, especially in our PI business.\nThe biotechnology, pharmaceutical and medical device industries generally, and clinical research specifically, are subject to increasingly rapid technological changes. Our competitors or others might develop technologies, products or services that are more effective or commercially attractive than our current or future technologies, products or services, or render our technologies, products or services less competitive or obsolete. If our competitors introduce superior technologies, products or services and we cannot make enhancements to our technologies, products and services necessary to remain competitive, our competitive position would be harmed. If we are unable to compete successfully, we may lose clients or be unable to attract new clients, which could lead to a decrease in our revenue.\nRisks Associated with Regulation or Legal Liabilities\nIf governmental regulation of the drug, medical device and biotechnology industry changes, the need for our services could decrease.\nGovernmental regulation of the drug, medical device and biotechnology product development process is complicated, extensive, and demanding. A large part of our business involves assisting pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device companies through the regulatory approval process. Changes in regulations that, for example, streamline procedures or relax approval standards, could eliminate or reduce the need for our services. If companies regulated by the FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities needed fewer of our services, we would have fewer business opportunities and our revenues would decrease, possibly materially.\nIn the United States, the FDA and the Congress have attempted to streamline the regulatory process by providing for industry user fees that fund the hiring of additional reviewers and better management of the regulatory review process. In Europe, governmental authorities have approved common standards for clinical testing of new drugs throughout the European Union by adopting standards for GCP and by making the clinical trial application and approval process more uniform across member states. The FDA has had GCP in place as a regulatory standard and requirement for new drug approval for many years, and Japan adopted GCP in 1998.\nThe United States, Europe and Japan have also collaborated for over 15 years on the International Conference on Harmonisation (\u201cICH\u201d), the purpose of which is to eliminate duplicative or conflicting regulations in the three regions. The ICH partners have agreed on a common format (the Common Technical Document) for new drug marketing applications that reduces the need to tailor the format to each region. Such efforts and similar efforts in the future that streamline the regulatory process may reduce the demand for our services. The revised ICH GCP E6 R2 guideline, strengthening especially risk management and oversight, is\nbeing implemented progressively (came into effect in June 2017 in the European Union). PAREXEL maintains an agile Quality Management System that anticipated the changes that would be required by the revised guideline and preemptively adjusted. As a result minimal changes to existing processes were required.\nParts of our PC business advise clients on how to satisfy regulatory standards for manufacturing and clinical processes and on other matters related to the enforcement of government regulations by the FDA and other regulatory bodies. Any reduction in levels of review of manufacturing or clinical processes or levels of regulatory enforcement, generally, would result in fewer opportunities for our business in this area.\nIf we fail to comply with existing regulations, and ethics standards our reputation and operating results would be harmed.\nOur business is subject to numerous governmental regulations, and ethics standards, primarily relating to worldwide pharmaceutical and medical device product development and regulatory approval, the conduct of clinical trials, and limitations on activities relating to delivery of health care items or services that are paid for with government health care program funding. In addition, we may be contractually obligated to assist our clients in complying with regulations that apply to our clients, including the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers and group purchasing organizations to report all payments or transfers of value to health care providers and teaching hospitals. If we fail to comply with these governmental regulations and ethics standards, such non-compliance could result in the termination of our ongoing research, development or sales and marketing projects, or the disqualification of data for submission to regulatory authorities. We also could be barred from providing clinical trial services in the future or could be subjected to civil monetary penalties or, in certain cases, criminal fines and penalties. Any of these consequences would harm our reputation, our prospects for future work and our operating results. In addition, we may have to repeat research or redo trials. If we are required to repeat research or redo trials, we may be contractually required to do so at no further cost to our clients, but at substantial cost to us.\nWe may lose business opportunities as a result of healthcare reform and the expansion of managed-care organizations.\nNumerous governments, including the U.S. government, have undertaken efforts to control growing healthcare costs through legislation, regulation and voluntary agreements with medical care providers and drug companies. In March 2010, the United States Congress enacted healthcare reform legislation intended over time to expand health insurance coverage and impose health industry cost containment measures. The continuing implementation of this legislation may significantly impact the pharmaceutical industry. In addition, this legislation and its implementation continue to face challenges in Congress and federal courts, and from certain state governments, opposition advocacy groups and some small business organizations, and we are uncertain as to the effects of this legislation on our business and are unable to predict what legislative proposals will be adopted in the future. The U.S. Congress has also considered and may adopt legislation that could have the effect of putting downward pressure on the prices that pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can charge for prescription drugs. In addition, various state legislatures and European and Asian governments may consider various types of healthcare reform in order to control growing healthcare costs. We are presently uncertain as to the effects of the enacted legislation on our business and are unable to predict what legislative proposals will be adopted in the future, if any.\nIf these efforts are successful, drug, medical device and biotechnology companies may react by spending less on research and development. If this were to occur, we would have fewer business opportunities and our revenue could decrease, possibly materially. In addition, new laws or regulations may create a risk of liability, increase our costs or limit our service offerings.\nIn addition to healthcare reform proposals, the expansion of managed-care organizations in the healthcare market and managed-care organizations\u2019 efforts to cut costs by limiting expenditures on pharmaceuticals and medical devices could result in pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device companies spending less on research and development. If this were to occur, we would have fewer business opportunities and our revenue could decrease, possibly materially.\nWe may have substantial exposure to payment of personal injury claims and may not have adequate insurance to cover such claims.\nOur CRS business primarily involves the testing of experimental drugs and medical devices on consenting human volunteers pursuant to a study protocol. Clinical research involves a risk of liability for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\npersonal injury or death to patients who participate in the study or who use a product approved by regulatory authorities after the clinical research has concluded;\n\u2022\ngeneral risks associated with our Early Phase facilities, including professional malpractice of physicians, nurses and other medical care providers; and\n\u2022\nerrors and omissions during a trial that may undermine the usefulness of a trial or data from the trial or study.\nIn order to mitigate the risk of liability, we seek to include indemnification provisions in our CRS contracts with clients and with investigators. However, we are not able to include indemnification provisions in all of our contracts. In addition, even if we are able to include an indemnification provision in our contracts, the indemnification provisions may not cover our exposure if:\n\u2022\nwe had to pay damages or incur defense costs in connection with a claim that is outside the scope of an indemnification agreement; or\n\u2022\na client failed to indemnify us in accordance with the terms of an indemnification agreement because it did not have the financial ability to fulfill its indemnification obligation or for any other reason.\nIn addition, contractual indemnifications generally do not protect us against liability arising from certain of our own actions, such as negligence or misconduct.\nWe also carry insurance to cover our risk of liability. However, our insurance is subject to deductibles and coverage limits and may not be adequate to cover claims. In addition, liability coverage is expensive. In the future, we may not be able to maintain or obtain the same levels of coverage on reasonable terms, at a reasonable cost, or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to claims.\nExisting and proposed laws and regulations regarding confidentiality of patients\u2019 and other individuals\u2019 personal information could result in increased risks of liability or increased cost to us or could limit our product and service offerings.\nThe confidentiality, security, use and disclosure of patient-specific information are subject to governmental regulation. Regulations to protect the safety and privacy of human subjects who participate in or whose data are used in clinical research generally require clinical investigators to obtain legally effective informed consent from identifiable research subjects before research is undertaken. Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (\u201cHITECH\u201d) Act of 2009, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has issued regulations mandating privacy and data security standards and breach notification requirements for certain types of individually identifiable health information, or protected health information, when used or disclosed by health care providers and other HIPAA-covered entities or business associates that provide services to or perform functions on behalf of these covered entities. HIPAA regulations generally require individuals\u2019 written authorization before identifiable health information may be used for research, in addition to any required informed consent. HIPAA regulations also specify standards for de-identifying health information so that information can be handled outside of the HIPAA requirements and for creating limited data sets that can be used for research purposes under less stringent HIPAA restrictions.\nThe European Union and its member states, as well as other countries, such as Canada, Argentina, Japan and other Asian countries, and state governments in the United States, have adopted and continue to implement new medical privacy and general data protection laws and regulations. In those countries, collecting, processing, using and transferring an individual\u2019s personal data is subject to specific requirements, such as obtaining explicit consent, processing the information for limited purposes and restrictions with respect to cross-border transfers. Many countries and almost all states in the United States have adopted data security breach laws that require the user of such data to inform the affected individuals and, in some cases, government authorities and the general public of security breaches. In order to comply with these laws and regulations and corresponding contractual demands from our clients, we must maintain internal compliance policies and procedures, and we may need to implement new privacy and security measures, which may require us to make substantial expenditures or cause us to limit the products and services we offer. In addition, if we violate applicable laws, regulations, contractual commitments, or other duties relating to the use, privacy or security of health information, we could be subject to civil liability or criminal penalties and it may be necessary to modify our business practices.\nFailure to achieve and maintain effective internal control in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and delays in completing our internal control audit and financial audit, could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nManagement assessments have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting due to ineffective controls associated with revenue recognition in our CRS reporting segment. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management is continuing to execute a remediation plan intended to address the control deficiencies which resulted in the material weakness. During the course of our testing, we may identify other significant deficiencies or material weaknesses, in addition to the one already identified, which we may not be able to remediate in a timely manner. If we continue to have one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will not be able to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment, or delays in completing our internal control audit and financial audit, could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could result in a decline in the market price of our common stock, and cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations in the future, which in turn could impact our ability to raise equity financing if needed in the future. While we believe our reported revenue is accurate, until this deficiency is substantially remediated, it is possible that internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect material misstatements in revenue reflected in our financial statements.\nWe operate in many different jurisdictions and we could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our internal policies mandate compliance with these anti-corruption laws. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and in certain circumstances, anti-corruption laws have appeared to conflict with local customs and practices. Despite our training and compliance programs, we cannot assure that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by persons associated with PAREXEL. Our continued global expansion, including in developing countries, could increase such risk in the future. Violations of these laws, or even allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nRisks Associated with Indebtedness\nOur indebtedness may limit cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our business.\nAs of June 30, 2017, we had $671.5 million principal amount of debt, excluding debt issuance cost of $2.7 million, outstanding and remaining borrowing availability of $170.0 million under our credit arrangements. We may incur additional debt in the future. Our leverage could have significant adverse consequences, including:\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to the payment of interest on, and principal of, our debt, which will reduce the amounts available to fund working capital and capital expenditures, and for other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we compete; and\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that have less debt.\nUnder the terms of our various credit facilities, interest rates are fixed based on market indices at the time of borrowing and, depending upon the interest mechanism selected by us, may float thereafter. Some of our other smaller credit facilities also bear interest at floating rates. As a result, the amount of interest payable by us on our borrowings may increase if market interest rates change.\nWe may not have sufficient funds, our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or we may be unable to arrange for additional financing, to pay the amounts due under our existing or any future debt, or any other liquidity needs. In addition, a failure to comply with the covenants under our existing credit facilities could result in an event of default under those credit facilities. In the event of an acceleration of amounts due under our credit facilities as a result of an event of default, we may not have sufficient funds or may be unable to arrange for additional financing to repay our indebtedness or to make any required accelerated payments.\nIn addition, the terms of the 2016 Credit Agreement and the Note Purchase Agreement provide that upon the occurrence of a change in control, as defined in the 2016 Credit Agreement and the Note Purchase Agreement, all outstanding indebtedness under the 2016 Credit Agreement and the Notes would become due. This provision may delay or prevent a change in control that our stockholders may consider desirable.\nOur existing credit facilities contain covenants that limit our flexibility and prevent us from taking certain actions.\nThe agreements in connection with our 2016 Credit Agreement and in our short term debt facilities include a number of restrictive covenants. These covenants could adversely affect us by limiting our ability to plan for or react to market conditions, meet our capital needs and execute our business strategy. These covenants, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt;\n\u2022\nbuy back our common stock;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments;\n\u2022\nenter into certain types of transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nmake specified restricted payments; and\n\u2022\nsell certain assets or merge with or into other companies.\nThese covenants may limit our operating and financial flexibility and limit our ability to respond to changes in our business or competitive activities. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in our being required to repay these borrowings before their scheduled due date.\nRisks Associated with our Common Stock\nOur corporate governance structure, including provisions of our articles of organization, by-laws, as well as Massachusetts law, may delay or prevent a change in control or management that stockholders may consider desirable.\nProvisions of our articles of organization, and by-laws, as well as provisions of Massachusetts law, may enable our management to resist an acquisition of us by a third party, or may discourage a third party from acquiring us. These provisions include the following:\n\u2022\nwe have divided our board of directors into three classes of directors that serve staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022\nwe are subject to Section 8.06 of the Massachusetts Business Corporation Law, which provides that directors may only be removed by stockholders for cause, vacancies in our Board of Directors may only be filled by a vote of our board of directors, and the number of directors may be fixed only by our board of directors;\n\u2022\nwe are subject to Chapter 110F of the Massachusetts General Laws, which may limit the ability of some interested stockholders to engage in business combinations with us; and\n\u2022\nour stockholders are limited in their ability to call or introduce proposals at stockholder meetings.\nThese provisions could have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a change in control of us or a change in our management that our stockholders may consider favorable or beneficial. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our stock.\nIn addition, our board of directors may issue preferred stock in the future without stockholder approval. If our board of directors issues preferred stock, the rights of the holders of common stock would be subordinate to the rights of the holders of preferred stock. Our board of directors\u2019 ability to issue the preferred stock could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or discourage a third party from acquiring, a majority of our stock.\nOur stock price has been, and may in the future be volatile, which could lead to losses by investors.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated widely in the past and may continue to do so in the future. On August 25, 2017, the closing sales price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market was $87.70 per share. During the period from June 30, 2012 to June 30, 2017, our common stock traded at prices ranging from a high of $86.50 per share to a low of $15.26 per share. Investors in our common stock must be willing to bear the risk of such fluctuations in stock price and the risk that the value of an investment in our common stock could decline.\nOur stock price can be affected by quarter-to-quarter variations in a number of factors including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\noperating results;\n\u2022\nearnings estimates by industry analysts;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions in our industry or the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries;\n\u2022\nprospects of healthcare reform;\n\u2022\nchanges in government regulations;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions, and\n\u2022\nour effective income tax rate.\nIn addition, the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are not related to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Although our common stock has traded in the past at a relatively high price-earnings multiple, due in part to analysts\u2019 expectations of earnings growth, the price of our common stock could quickly and substantially decline as a result of even a relatively small shortfall in earnings from, or a change in, analysts\u2019 expectations.\nWe do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe do not anticipate that we will pay any dividends to holders of our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any payment of cash dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our financial condition, capital requirements, legal requirements, earnings and other factors. Our ability to pay dividends is restricted by the terms of our 2016 Credit Agreement and might be restricted by the terms of any indebtedness that we incur in the future. Consequently, you should not rely on dividends\nin order to receive a return on your investment. For additional information on our dividend policy, see Part II, Item 5 \"Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "PERMNO": 82607, "SIC": 8731, "TIC": "PRXL"}
