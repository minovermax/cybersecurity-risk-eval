{"cik": "23111", "company": "COMPUTER TASK GROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nThe following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risk factors below represent what we believe are the known material risk factors with respect to the Company and our business. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, our operations, the industry in which we operate, our financial position or our future financial results.\nOur business depends on the availability of a large number of highly qualified IT professionals and our ability to recruit and retain these professionals.\nWe actively compete with many other IT service providers for qualified professional staff. The availability of qualified professional staff may affect our ability to provide services and meet the needs of our customers in the future. An inability to fulfill customer requirements at agreed upon rates due to a lack of available qualified staff may adversely impact our revenue and operating results in the future.\nIncreased competition and the bargaining power of our large customers may cause our billing rates to decline, which would have an adverse effect on our revenue and, if we are unable to control our personnel costs accordingly, on our margins and operating results.\nWe have experienced reductions in the rates at which we bill some of our larger customers for services due to the highly competitive market conditions that exist at this time. Additionally, we actively compete against many other companies for business at new and existing clients. Billing rate reductions or competitive pressures may lead to a further decline in revenue. If we are unable to make commensurate reductions in our personnel costs, our margins and operating results in the future would be adversely affected.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from a single customer and a significant reduction in the amount of IT services requested by this customer would have an adverse effect on our revenue and operating results.\nIBM is CTG\u2019s largest customer. CTG provides services to various IBM divisions in many locations. During 2014, the National Technical Services Agreement (NTS Agreement) with IBM was renewed for three years until December 31, 2017. In 2014, 2013, and 2012, IBM accounted for $90.5 million or 23.0%, $101.7 million or 24.3%, and $113.8 million or 26.8% of the Company\u2019s consolidated revenue, respectively. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company\u2019s revenue in 2014, 2013 or 2012. The Company\u2019s accounts receivable from IBM at December 31, 2014 and 2013 amounted to $7.8 million and $11.5 million, respectively. In January 2014, IBM announced its intention to sell off its x86 server division to Lenovo, and the initial closing of that sale occurred on September 29, 2014. A portion of the Company's 2014 and 2013 revenue from IBM was related to the x86 server division. Lenovo has not made any assurances that the Company will retain a significant share of the revenue derived from the x86 server division. If IBM or Lenovo were to significantly reduce the amount of IT services they purchase from the Company, our revenue and operating results would be adversely affected.\nOur customer contracts generally have a short term or are terminable on short notice and a significant number of failures to renew contracts, early terminations or renegotiations of our existing customer contracts could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur clients typically retain us on a non-exclusive, engagement-by-engagement basis, rather than under exclusive long-term contracts. We performed 86.2% of our services on a time-and-materials basis during 2014. As such, our customers generally have the right to terminate a contract with us upon written notice without the payment of any financial penalty. Client projects may involve multiple engagements or stages, and there is a risk that a client may choose not to retain us for additional stages of a project, or that a client will cancel or delay additional planned engagements. These terminations, cancellations or delays could result from factors that are beyond our control and are unrelated to our work product or the progress of the project, but could be related to business or financial conditions of the client, changes in client strategies or the economy in general. When contracts are terminated, we lose the anticipated future revenue and we may not be able to eliminate the associated costs required to support those contracts in a timely manner. Consequently, our operating results in subsequent periods may be lower than expected. Our clients can cancel or reduce the scope of their engagements with us on short notice. If they do so, we may be unable to reassign our professionals to new engagements without delay. The cancellation or reduction in scope of an engagement could, therefore, reduce the utilization rate of our professionals, which would have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. As a result of these and other factors, our past financial performance should not be relied on as a guarantee of similar or better future\nperformance. Due to these factors, we believe that our results from operations may fluctuate from period to period in the future.\nA significant portion of our total assets consists of goodwill and capitalized software projects, which are subject to a periodic impairment analysis and a significant impairment determination in any future period could have an adverse effect on our results of operations even without a significant loss of revenue or increase in cash expenses attributable to such period.\nWe have goodwill recorded totaling approximately $37.4 million at December 31, 2014. We also have capitalized software projects recorded totaling $5.5 million at December 31, 2014. At least annually, we evaluate this goodwill and capitalized software for impairment. The goodwill is evaluated based on the fair value of the business operations or projects to which this goodwill relates. This estimated fair value could change if there is a significant decrease in the enterprise value of CTG, if we are unable to achieve operating results at the levels that have been forecasted, the market valuation of transactions involving similar companies decreases which could occur given the economic downturn in recent years in the countries in which the Company operates, or there is a permanent, negative change in the market demand for the services offered by this business unit, or in the case of capitalized software, there is an absence of historical or projected revenue for the solution. These changes could result in an impairment of the existing goodwill balance or the capitalized software costs that could require a material non-cash charge which would have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nThe introduction of new IT products or services or changes in customer requirements for IT products or services may render our existing IT Solutions or IT Staffing offerings obsolete or unnecessary, which, if we are unable to keep pace with these corresponding changes, could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to implement and deliver IT Solutions or IT Staffing services that anticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology, industry standards and client preferences and requirements. We may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely basis, and our offerings may not be successful in the marketplace. Also, services, solutions and technologies developed by our competitors may make our solutions or staffing offerings uncompetitive or obsolete. Any one of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain and successfully complete client engagements.\nWe could be subject to liability and damage to our reputation resulting from cyber attacks or data breaches.\nInformation security risks for companies providing information technology (IT) and professional services, especially in Healthcare-related industries, have increased over recent years. This increase in risk may be attributed to the value of personally identifiable information or personal data used for identity theft and fraud, the increasing sophistication and activities of attackers including organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists, and other third parties, and the reliance on Internet-based communications, and new technologies. The Company\u2019s operations and business rely on the secure processing, transmission, storage and availability of information and resources provided by our information technology environment. This complex environment supports a variety of technologies, industries, and delivery teams across the United States and Europe.\nAlthough the Company has not experienced any prior material data breaches or cyber incidents, its technical environment may become the target of cyber attacks or data breaches caused by external entities, third-party vendors, or the Company's personnel, both intentionally and unintentionally. These cyber attacks or data breaches could result in the disruption of the Company's internal and customer-facing business operations, and could also result in the unauthorized disclosure, misuse, loss, and destruction of both the Company\u2019s and its customers\u2019 confidential and regulated information, including United States designated personally identifiable information (PII), personal data under the European Union Data Protection Directive, or protected health information (PHI) under the United States Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).\nThe Company\u2019s failure to protect PII, personal data, or PHI could result in reputational damage, fines and penalties, litigation costs, external investigations, compensation costs including reimbursement and monetary awards, and/or additional compliance costs which could have a material, adverse impact. It could also have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s ability to execute contracts with customers that produce or work with this data, and make it more difficult to recruit qualified personnel to perform its services in the future. As the cyber threat landscape continues to evolve or the Company\u2019s risk profile changes, it may be required to expend additional resources to enhance existing protective measures or implement new mitigation strategies.\nThe foreign currency exchange, legislative, tax, regulatory and economic risks associated with international operations could have an adverse effect on our operating results if we are unable to mitigate or hedge these risks.\nWe have operations in the United States and Canada in North America, and in Belgium, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom in Europe. Although our foreign operations conduct their business in their local currencies, these operations are subject to their own currency fluctuations, legislation, employment and tax law changes, and economic climates. These factors as they relate to our foreign operations are different than those of the United States. Although we actively manage these foreign operations with local management teams, our overall operating results may be negatively affected by local economic conditions, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, or tax, regulatory or other economic changes beyond our control.\nGovernment cuts in healthcare programs, such as Medicare, and delays in legislative or regulatory healthcare mandates could cause a reduction in IT spending by our healthcare customers, which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s growth efforts are primarily focused in the healthcare market. Growth in this market depends on continued spending by our healthcare customers on IT projects. Cuts in government healthcare programs, such as sequestration, which cut Medicare reimbursements to hospitals and health systems in April 2013, may result in reduced expenditures by our healthcare customers on IT projects. For example, the Company\u2019s healthcare revenue decreased $19.3 million or 14.7% in 2014 from 2013. If further government cuts in healthcare programs were to occur, whether due to the failure of Congress to adopt a budget, pass appropriations bills or raise the U.S. debt ceiling or for other reasons, there may be delays, reductions or cessation of funding to our customers, which could cause them to purchase less IT services from us, which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nIn addition, delays in implementation of legislative or regulatory healthcare mandates could adversely affect the IT spending by our healthcare customers to implement such mandates. For example, the implementation date for ICD-10, a diagnostic coding system used for billing in the healthcare industry, was delayed in early 2014 until October 1, 2015. This delay caused a number of our healthcare customers to defer spending allocated for 2014 for IT projects that would have updated their billings systems. If implementation of existing or contemplated legislative or regulatory healthcare mandates are further deferred, the resulting reduction in IT spending by our healthcare customers could materially and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nChanges in government regulations and laws affecting the IT services industry, and the industries in which our clients operate, including accounting principles and interpretations, and the taxation of domestic operations could adversely affect our results of operations.\nChanging laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), and new SEC regulations, create uncertainty for companies such as ours. These new or updated laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations which, in many instances, is due to their lack of specificity. As a result, the application of these new standards and regulations in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure. As a result, our efforts to comply with evolving laws, tax regulations and other standards have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. In particular, our continuing efforts to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the related regulations regarding our required assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting and our independent auditors\u2019 audit of internal control require the commitment of significant internal, financial and managerial resources.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the SEC, and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) or other accounting rule making authorities may issue new accounting rules or auditing standards that are different than those that we presently apply to our financial results. Such new accounting rules or auditing standards could require significant changes from the way we currently report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nU.S. generally accepted accounting principles have been the subject of frequent changes in interpretations. As a result of the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the review of accounting policies by the SEC as well as by national and international accounting standards bodies, the frequency of future accounting policy\nchanges may accelerate. Such future changes in financial accounting standards may have a significant effect on our reported results of operations, including results of transactions entered into before the effective date of the changes.\nIn 2014 and previous years, the Company offered limited healthcare coverage to its hourly employees, which includes nearly half of its total employees. Under the PPACA, the Company will be required to offer expanded healthcare coverage to those employees, or potentially pay financial penalties. Beginning in 2015, the Company is in the process of offering compliant healthcare coverage as required. Although it is difficult to estimate the financial impact of this healthcare coverage, the Company's intention is to pass the additional costs on to the customers where our hourly employees who elect this coverage are engaged. However, in the event the Company is not able to pass some or all of these costs to its customers, the Company\u2019s operating results would be negatively impacted.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the United States (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our provisions for income and other taxes and our tax liabilities in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in various federal, state and international tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof, which could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future periods.\nDuring 2014 and 2013, the Company experienced higher unemployment tax rates in many of the states in which we do business, which increased our direct costs and negatively impacted our profitability. Considering current economic conditions in the U.S. in the markets in which we operate and the IT staffing nature of a large portion of our business, the Company expects these rates will not significantly change in 2015 and future years.\nExisting and potential customers may outsource or consider outsourcing their IT requirements to foreign countries in which we may not currently have operations, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain new customers or retain existing customers.\nIn the past few years, more companies have started using, or are considering using, low cost offshore outsourcing centers to perform technology-related work and complete projects. Currently, we have partnered with clients to perform services outside of North America to mitigate and reduce this risk to our Company. However, the risk of additional increases in the future in the outsourcing of IT solutions overseas to countries where we do not have operations could have a material, negative impact on our future operations.\nDecreases in demand for IT Solutions and IT Staffing services in the future would cause an adverse effect on our revenue and operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s revenue and operating results are significantly affected by changes in demand for its services. In the past, the U.S. economy, where the Company performs approximately 80% of its total business based upon revenue, significantly deteriorated primarily due to subprime mortgage issues, financial market conditions, and other economic concerns. In 2009, these economic pressures also extended to the European markets where the Company operates. These negative pressures on the economy led to a worldwide contraction of the credit markets, more severe recessionary conditions, and a decline in demand for the Company\u2019s services which negatively affected the Company\u2019s revenue and operating results in 2009 as compared with prior years. Economic pressures also led to customers\u2019 reducing their spending on IT projects and external professional services. Overall economic conditions in 2010 through 2014 stabilized in the U.S., and in 2013 began to improve in Europe. While economic conditions improved in 2014 in the U.S., the Company experienced a decline in revenue for its electronic health record business as the April 2013 sequestration caused a reduction in demand for our services from our healthcare clients. Declines in spending for IT services in 2015 or future years may adversely affect our operating results as they have in the past.\nThe IT services industry is highly competitive and fragmented, which means that our customers have a number of choices for providers of IT services and we may not be able to compete effectively.\nThe market for our services is highly competitive. The market is fragmented, and no company holds a dominant position. Consequently, our competition for client requirements and experienced personnel varies significantly by geographic area and by the type of service provided. Some of our competitors are larger and have greater technical, financial, and marketing resources and greater name recognition than we have in the markets we collectively serve. In addition, clients may elect to increase their internal IT systems resources to satisfy their custom software development and integration needs. Finally, our industry is being impacted by the growing use of lower-cost offshore delivery capabilities (primarily India and other parts of Asia). There can be no assurance that\nwe will be able to continue to compete successfully with existing or future competitors or that future competition will not have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to collect our receivables or unbilled services, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nOur business depends on our ability to successfully obtain payment from our clients of the amounts they owe us for work performed. We evaluate the financial condition of our clients and typically bill and collect on reasonable cycles. We might, however, not accurately assess the creditworthiness of our clients, or macroeconomic conditions could also result in financial difficulties for our clients, including bankruptcy and insolvency. In certain industries, some clients have requested longer payment terms, which has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our cash flows. The timely collection of client balances also depends on our ability to complete our contractual commitments as required. If we are unable to meet our commitments, or bill our clients on a timely basis, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. We have established allowances for losses of receivables and unbilled services where we deem the amounts to be uncollectible. The uncollectible amounts due to the Company from clients could differ from those that we currently anticipate.\nOur share price could fluctuate and be difficult to predict.\nOur share price has fluctuated in the past and could continue to fluctuate in the future in response to various factors. These factors include changes in macroeconomic or political factors unrelated to our business in the geographies in which we operate, general or industry-specific market conditions or changes in financial markets, our failure to meet our growth and financial objectives, including revenue growth, operating margin expansion and earnings per share growth, our ability to generate enough cash flow to return cash to our shareholders at historical levels or levels expected by our shareholders, announcements by us or competitors about developments in our business or prospects, and projections or speculation about our business by the media or investment analysts.\nIf we repatriate our cash balances from our foreign operations, we may be subject to additional tax liabilities.\nWe earn a portion of our operating income outside of the United States, and any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions to the United States may result in higher effective tax rates and additional tax liabilities for the Company. In addition, there have been proposals to change the tax laws in the United States that would significantly impact how United States based multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form, or in what time frame, any proposed legislation may be passed, if enacted, these tax laws could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flows.\nIneffective internal controls could impact the Company's business and operating results.\nThe Company's internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of the inherent limitations of internal controls, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, poorly designed or ineffective controls, or fraud. Internal controls that are deemed to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of the Company's financial statements. If the Company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls, including the failure to implement new or improve existing controls, or fails to properly execute or properly test these controls, the Company's business and operating results could be negatively impacted and the Company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations.\nChanging economic conditions and the effect of such changes on accounting estimates could have a material impact on our results of operations.\nThe Company has also made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of its assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare its consolidated financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC and other accounting rulemaking authorities. Such estimates primarily relate to the valuation of goodwill, the valuation of stock options for recording equity-based compensation expense, allowances for doubtful accounts receivable, investment valuation, incurred but not recorded claims related to the Company's self insured medical plan, valuation allowances for deferred tax assets, legal matters, other contingencies and estimates of progress toward completion and direct profit or loss on contracts, as applicable. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ from these estimates. Changes in the economic climates in which the Company operates may affect these estimates and will be reflected in the Company\u2019s financial statements in the event they occur. Such changes could result in a material impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations.", "PERMNO": 26084, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "CTG"}
