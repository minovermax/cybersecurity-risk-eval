RISK FACTORS\nBelow is a series of risk factors that may affect the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations. Other risk factors are contained in \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company operates in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risk factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of these risk factors on the Company's business, financial condition and/or results of operations or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors may impact any of these areas.\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic Impact\nWe are unable to predict the ongoing impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on Company traffic, sales and profitability.\nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic was declared a national emergency on March 13, 2020 and the Company was classified as an essential business. Since that time the Company has had to continuously alter certain operating procedures to accommodate isolation/social distancing, school and restaurant closures, reduced leisure travel, and increased remote work. At times, some of the Company\u2019s stores were subject to capacity limits, masking requirements, and social distancing measures that incorporated enhanced cleaning, additional protective equipment and the closure of self-service food bars plus in-house dining.\nDuring fiscal year 2021, vaccines became widely available and are administered in all our pharmacies. As the economy began to recover, we have experienced labor shortages in our stores and distribution center. Truck driver shortages and supply chain disruptions have resulted in occasional product shortages in our stores. Inflation in food and fuel costs have reached levels not experienced in many years.\nOur sales continue to be above pre-pandemic levels. At the present time, we do not know how long the pandemic will influence our daily operations. National, state and local mandates related to the pandemic continue to evolve and may result in vaccination requirements that could impact our ability to retain associates.\nRecent OSHA guidelines require that employers with over 100 employees either, by January 2022, have all employees vaccinated or test employees weekly for COVID-19. These guidelines are currently being challenged in the courts. At this time we do not know how or when this dispute will be resolved and what the impact will be on the Company\u2019s operations.\nAny of the foregoing factors, or other effects of the pandemic that are not currently foreseeable, may materially increase costs, negatively impact sales and adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and its liquidity position\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nThe Company\u2019s warehouse and distribution center and milk processing and packaging plant, as well as all of the Company\u2019s stores, are concentrated in the Southeastern United States, which makes it vulnerable to economic downturns, natural disasters and other adverse conditions or other catastrophic events in this region.\nThe Company operates in the Southeastern United States, and its performance is therefore heavily influenced by economic developments in the Southeast region. The Company\u2019s headquarters, warehouse and distribution center and milk processing and packaging plant are located in North Carolina and all of the Company\u2019s stores are located in the Southeast region. As a result, the Company\u2019s business may be more susceptible to regional factors than the operations of more geographically diversified competitors. These factors include, among others, changes in the economy, weather conditions, demographics and population.\nVarious aspects of the Company\u2019s business are subject to federal, state and local laws and various operating regulations. The Company\u2019s compliance with these regulations may require additional capital expenditures and could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to conduct the Company\u2019s business as planned.\nThe Company is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to zoning, land use, work place safety, public health, community right-to-know, beer and wine sales, country of origin labeling of food products, pharmaceutical sales and gasoline station operations. Furthermore, the Company\u2019s business is regulated by a variety of governmental agencies, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and OSHA. Employers are also subject to laws governing their relationship with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions, insurance coverage, disabled access and work permit requirements. Recent and proposed regulation has had or may have a future impact on the cost of insurance benefits for associates and on the cost of processing debit and credit card transactions. Compliance with, or changes in, these laws could reduce the revenue and profitability of the Company\u2019s supermarkets and could otherwise adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company is affected by certain operating costs which could increase or fluctuate considerably.\nThe Company depends on qualified associates to operate the Company\u2019s stores. A shortage of qualified associates could require the Company to enhance the Company\u2019s wage and benefit package in order to better compete for and retain qualified associates, and the Company may not be able to recover these increased labor costs through price increases charged to customers, which could significantly increase the Company\u2019s operating costs.\nThe Company is self-insured for workers\u2019 compensation, general liability and group medical and dental benefits. Risks and uncertainties are associated with self-insurance; however, the Company has limited its exposure by maintaining excess liability coverage. Self-insurance liabilities are established based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported. The estimates are based on data provided by the respective claims administrators and analyses performed by actuaries engaged by the Company. These estimates can fluctuate if historical trends are not predictive of the future. The majority of the Company\u2019s properties are self-insured for casualty losses and business interruption; however, liability coverage is maintained.\nEnergy and utility costs have been volatile in recent years, during which time the Company has expanded its store square footage. The Company attempts to increase its energy efficiency during store construction and remodeling through the use of energy-saving equipment and construction.\nThe Company is subject to risks related to information systems and data security.\nThe Company\u2019s business is dependent on information technology systems. These complex systems are an important part of ongoing operations. If the Company were to experience disruption in these systems, did not maintain existing systems properly, or did not implement new systems appropriately, operations could suffer. The Company is currently undergoing a systematic program to enhance its information technology abilities.\nThe Company has implemented procedures to protect its information technology systems and data necessary to conduct ongoing operations. The Company cannot however, be certain that all of these systems and data are entirely free from vulnerability to attack.\nCompliance with tougher privacy and information security laws and standards, including protection of customer debit and credit card information, may result in higher investments in technology and changes to operational processes.\nIn recent years, more industry transactions have been online for ordering and fulfillment. This trend places a higher reliance on effective and efficient information systems.\nThe Company is affected by the availability and wholesale price of gasoline and retail gasoline prices, all of which can fluctuate quickly and considerably.\nThe Company operates fuel stations at 107 of its store locations. While the Company obtains gasoline and diesel fuel from a number of different suppliers, long-term disruption in the availability and wholesale price of gasoline for resale could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nFluctuating fuel costs could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating costs which depend on fuel for the Company\u2019s fleet of tractors and trailers which distribute goods from the Company\u2019s distribution facility and for the Company\u2019s fluid dairy operations.\nFurthermore, fluctuating fuel costs could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s total gasoline sales (both in terms of dollars and gallons sold), the profitability of gasoline sales, and the Company\u2019s plans to develop additional fuel centers. Also, retail gas price volatility could diminish customer usage of fueling centers and, thus, adversely affect customer traffic at the Company\u2019s stores.\nThe Company\u2019s industry is highly competitive. If the Company is unable to compete effectively, the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected.\nThe supermarket industry is highly competitive and continues to be characterized by intense price competition, increasing fragmentation of retail formats, entry of non-traditional competitors (both physical and online) and market consolidation. Furthermore, some of the Company\u2019s competitors have greater financial resources and could use these financial resources to take measures, such as altering product mix, reducing prices, home/in-store fulfillment, or online ordering which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s competitive position.\nDisruptions in the efficient distribution of food products to the Company\u2019s warehouse and stores may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s business could be adversely affected by disruptions in the efficient distribution of food products to the Company\u2019s warehouse and stores. Such disruptions could be caused by, among other things, adverse weather conditions, fuel availability, shortage of truck drivers, food contamination recalls and civil unrest in foreign countries in which the Company\u2019s suppliers do business.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to economic conditions that impact consumer spending.\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations are sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that impact consumer spending, including discretionary spending. Future economic conditions such as employment levels, business conditions, interest rates, energy and fuel costs and tax rates could reduce consumer spending or change consumer purchasing habits. A general reduction in the level of consumer spending or the Company\u2019s inability to respond to shifting consumer attitudes regarding products, store location and other factors could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nInflation could impact the Company\u2019s operations\nAs the economy recovers from the initial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation has recently reached levels not experienced in decades. Food and energy costs have increased, reflecting a tight labor market and supply chain/transportation issues.\nThe following table from the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics lists annualized changes in the Consumer Price Index that could have an effect on the Company\u2019s operations. One of the Company\u2019s significant costs is labor, which increases with general inflation. Inflation or deflation in energy costs affects the Company\u2019s gasoline sales, distribution expenses and plastic supply costs. During fiscal year 2021, inflation has reached its highest level in a number of years, impacting food costs, transportation costs, and labor costs.\nRisk Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe Company\u2019s principal stockholder, Robert P. Ingle II, has the ability to elect a majority of the Company\u2019s directors, appoint new members of management and approve many actions requiring stockholder approval.\nMr. Ingle II\u2019s beneficial ownership (as defined by the applicable rules under the Exchange Act) represents approximately 71% of the combined voting power of all classes of the Company\u2019s capital stock as of September 25, 2021. As a result, Mr. Ingle II has the power to elect a majority of the Company\u2019s directors and approve any action requiring the approval of the holders of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, including adopting certain amendments to the Company\u2019s charter and approving mergers or sales of substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets.\nThe Company is a Controlled Company under the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules. As a result, the Company is exempt from certain of NASDAQ\u2019s corporate governance policies, including the requirements that the majority of Directors be independent (as defined in NASDAQ rules), and that the Company have a nominating committee for Director candidates.", "PERMNO": 11701, "SIC": 5411, "TIC": "IMKTA"}
