{"cik": "1163302", "company": "UNITED STATES STEEL CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOperational Risk Factors\nOur Investments in New Technologies May Not Be Fully Successful\nExecution of our strategy depends, in part, on the success of a number of investments we have made in new technologies. All of our investments are expected to deliver an enhanced \u201cbest of both\u201d business model that delivers cost and/or capability differentiation for our stakeholders. Our intent to eventually acquire 100% of Big River Steel, like our other investments in state-of-the-art sustainable steel technologies including, but not limited to, the endless casting and rolling line at Mon Valley Works and XG3 at our PRO-TEC joint venture, is a significant element of our strategy. If our investment in Big River Steel fails to provide the benefits we expect or our financial condition is constrained, we may choose not to exercise our option to acquire its remaining outstanding ownership interests. In addition, if Big River Steel does not achieve the expected financial performance, we still may be required to acquire the remaining ownership interests at a discounted purchase price. Additionally, like with any significant construction project, we may be subject to changing market conditions and demand for our completed projects, delays and cost overruns, work stoppages, labor shortages, engineering issues, weather interferences, changes required by governmental authorities, delays or the inability to acquire required permits or licenses, the ability to finance the projects or disruption of existing operations, any of which could have an adverse impact on our operational and financial results. Furthermore, new product development or modification is costly, involves significant research, development, time and expense and may not necessarily result in the successful commercialization of any new products, or new technologies may not perform as intended or expected. Unsuccessful execution of these strategic projects or underperformance of any of these assets could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operational footprint, unplanned equipment outages and other unforeseen disruptions may adversely impact our results of operations.\nU. S. Steel has adjusted its operating configuration in response to market conditions, including global overcapacity and unfairly traded imports, by idling and restarting production at certain facilities. Due to our operational footprint, the Company may not be able to respond in an efficient manner to fully realize the benefits from changing market conditions that are favorable to integrated steel producers.\nOur steel production depends on the operation of critical structures and pieces of equipment, such as blast furnaces, steel shops, casters, hot strip mills and various structures and operations that support them. While we are implementing initiatives focused on proactive maintenance of key machinery and equipment at our production facilities, we may experience prolonged periods of reduced production and increased maintenance and repair costs due to equipment failures at our facilities or those of our key suppliers.\nIt is also possible that operations may be disrupted due to other unforeseen circumstances such as power outages, explosions, fires, floods, accidents, severe weather conditions, and changes in U.S., European Union and other foreign tariffs, free trade agreements, trade regulations, laws, and policies. We are also exposed to similar risks involving major customers and suppliers such as force majeure events of raw materials suppliers that have occurred and may occur in the future. Availability of raw materials and delivery of products to customers could be affected by logistical disruptions, such as shortages of barges, ocean vessels, rail cars or trucks, or unavailability of rail lines or of the locks on the Great Lakes or other bodies of water. To the extent that lost production could not be compensated for at unaffected facilities and depending on the length of the outage, our sales and our unit production costs could be adversely affected.\nU. S. Steel continues to incur certain costs when production capacity is idled, increased costs to resume production at idled facilities, or costs to idle facilities.\nOur decisions concerning which facilities to operate and at what levels are made based upon our customers\u2019 orders for products as well as the capabilities and cost performance of our locations. During periods of depressed market conditions, we may concentrate production operations at several plant locations and not operate others in response to customer demand, and as a result we will incur idle facility costs.\nWhen we restart idled facilities, we incur certain costs to replenish raw material inventories, prepare the previously idled facilities for operation, perform the required repair and maintenance activities and prepare employees to return to work safely and resume production responsibilities. The amount of any such costs can be material, depending on\na variety of factors, such as the period of time during which the facilities remained idle, necessary repairs and available employees, and is difficult to project.\nU. S. Steel has been and continues to be adversely affected by unfairly traded imports and global overcapacity, which may cause downward pricing pressure, lost sales and revenue, market share, decreased production, investment, and profitability.\nCurrently, global steel production capacity significantly exceeds global steel demand, which adversely affects U.S. and global steel prices. Global overcapacity continues to result in high levels of dumped and subsidized steel imports into the markets we serve. Domestic and international trade laws provide mechanisms to address the injury caused by such imports to domestic industries. Excessive imports of steel products into the U.S. has resulted and may continue to result in downward pricing pressure and lost sales and revenue, which adversely impacts our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Additional planned capacity in the U.S. could increase this overcapacity and further negatively impact U.S. steel prices.\nThough U. S. Steel currently benefits from 54 U.S. antidumping and countervailing duty (AD/CVD) orders and 11 European Union (EU) AD/CVD orders, petitions for trade relief are not always successful or effective. When received, such relief is generally subject to periodic reviews and challenges, which can result in revocation of the AD/CVD order or reduction of the AD/CVD duties. There can be no assurance that any relief will be obtained or continued in the future or that such relief will adequately combat unfairly traded imports.\nThe current Section 232 national security tariffs and quotas on steel imports into the U.S. also provide U. S. Steel and other domestic steel producers relief from imports. Likewise, the EU\u2019s retaliatory 25 percent tariffs on certain U.S. steel imports and safeguard measures on steel provide USSE and other European steel producers some degree of relief from imports. The duration of the Section 232 tariffs and quotas, the outcome of outstanding product exclusion requests before the U.S. Department of Commerce, and the EU retaliatory and safeguard relief is not known.\nFaced with significant imports into the U.S. and overcapacity in various markets, we will continue to evaluate potential strategic and organizational opportunities, which may include exiting lines of business and the sale of certain assets, temporary shutdowns or closures of facilities.\nWe face risks relating to changes in U.S. and foreign tariffs, trade agreements, laws, and policies\nThrough a series of Presidential Proclamations pursuant to Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, U.S. imports of certain steel products are subject to a 25 percent tariff, except for imports from: (1) Argentina, Brazil, and Korea, which are subject to restrictive quotas; (2) Canada and Mexico, which are currently not subject to either tariffs or quotas, but tariffs could be re-imposed on surging product groups after consultations; and (3) Australia, which is not subject to tariffs, quotas or an anti-surge mechanism. The Section 232 national security tariffs and quotas on steel imports currently provide U. S. Steel and other domestic steel producers critical relief from imports. With no scheduled end date, the duration of the Section 232 relief is not known. Further, the U.S. government may negotiate alternatives to the Section 232 tariffs for certain countries. The U.S. Department of Commerce continues to administer its Section 232 product exclusion process. The Section 232 action on aluminum and steel imports, potential Section 232 action on other products, and recent and potential additional U.S. import tariffs imposed under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 have resulted in the possibility of tariffs being applied to materials and/or items we purchase from subject countries or regions as part of our manufacturing process, and may result in additional, retaliatory action by foreign governments on U.S. exports of a range of products, including products produced by our customers. In February 2019, the European Commission imposed a definitive safeguard on global steel imports in the form of tariff rate quotas (TRQs; 25 percent tariffs on steel imports that exceed the quota) effective through June 2021. All of the above factors present a degree of uncertainty to our financial and operational performance, our customers, and overall economic conditions, all of which could impact steel demand and our performance.\nThe steel industry is highly cyclical, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nSteel consumption is highly cyclical and generally follows economic and industrial conditions both worldwide and in regional markets. This volatility makes it difficult to balance the procurement of raw materials and energy with global steel prices, our steel production and customer product demand. U. S. Steel has implemented strategic initiatives to produce more stable and consistent results, even during periods of economic and market downturns, but this may not be enough to mitigate the effect that the volatility inherent in the steel industry has on our results of operations.\nAdditionally, our business is reliant on certain other industries that are cyclical in nature. We sell to the automotive, service center, converter, energy and appliance and construction-related industries. Some of these industries exhibit a great deal of sensitivity to general economic conditions and may also face meaningful fluctuations in demand based on a number of factors outside of our control, including regulatory factors, economic conditions, and raw material and energy costs. As a result, downturns or volatility in any of the markets we serve could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe face increased competition from alternative materials and risks concerning innovation, new technologies, products and increasing customer requirements.\nAs a result of increasingly stringent regulatory requirements, designers, engineers and industrial manufacturers, especially those in the automotive industry, are increasing their use of lighter weight and alternative materials, such as aluminum, composites, plastics, and carbon fiber. Use of such materials could reduce the demand for steel products, which may reduce our profitability and cash flow.\nAdditionally, technologies such as direct iron reduction, EAF production, oxygen-coal injection and experimental technologies such as molten oxide electrolysis and hydrogen flash smelting may be more cost effective than our current production methods. However, we may not have sufficient capital to invest in such technologies and may incur difficulties adapting and fully integrating these technologies into our existing operations. We may also encounter production restrictions, or not realize the cost benefit from such capital intensive technology adaptations to our current production processes. Customers, such as those in the automotive industry, are demanding stronger and lighter products. Tubular customers are increasingly requesting pipe producers to supply connections and other ancillary parts as well as inspection and other services. We may not be successful in meeting these technological challenges.\nLimited availability, or volatility in prices of raw materials and energy may constrain operating levels and reduce profit margins.\nU. S. Steel and other steel producers have periodically faced problems obtaining sufficient raw materials and energy in a timely manner due to delays, defaults, severe weather conditions, or force majeure events, shortages or transportation problems (such as shortages of barges, ore vessels, rail cars or trucks, or disruption of rail lines, waterways, or natural gas transmission lines), resulting in production curtailments. As a result, we may be exposed to risks concerning pricing and availability of raw materials from third parties as well as logistics constraints moving our own raw materials to our plants. USSE purchases substantially all of its iron ore and coking coal requirements from outside sources. USSE is also dependent upon availability of natural gas produced in Russia and transported through Ukraine. Any curtailments or escalated costs may further reduce profit margins.\nU. S. Steel has agreed, and may continue to agree, to purchase raw materials and energy at prices that have been, and may be, above future market prices or in greater volumes than required in the future. Additionally, any future decreases in iron ore, scrap, natural gas and oil prices may place downward pressure on steel prices. If steel prices decline, our profit margins on indexed contracts and spot business could be reduced.\nChanges in the global economic environment and prolonged periods of slow economic growth could have an adverse effect on our industry and business, as well as those of our customers and suppliers.\nOverall economic conditions in the U.S. and globally, including Europe, significantly impact our business. Periods of economic downturn or continued uncertainty, including the significant decline of market conditions in Europe, could result in difficulty increasing or maintaining our level of sales or profitability and we may experience an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur U.S. operations are subject to economic conditions, including credit and capital market conditions, and political factors in the U.S., which if changed could negatively affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Political factors include, but are not limited to, taxation, inflation, increased regulation, limitations on exports of energy and raw materials, and trade remedies. Actions taken by the U.S. government could affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nUSSE is subject to economic conditions and political factors associated with the EU, Slovakia and neighboring countries, and the euro currency. Changes in any of these economic conditions or political factors could negatively affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Political factors include, but are not limited to, taxation, nationalization, inflation, government instability, civil unrest, increased regulation and quotas, tariffs and other protectionist measures.\nOur Flat-Rolled and Tubular segments may also be particularly impacted by unfavorable market conditions in the oil and gas industries. Declines in oil prices, and the correlating reduction in drilling activity, as well as high levels of inventory in the supply chain, may reduce demand for tubular products and could have adverse impacts on our results of operations and cash flows.\nAdditionally, we are also exposed to risks associated with the business success and creditworthiness of our suppliers and customers. If our customers or suppliers are negatively impacted by a slowdown in economic markets, we may face the reduction, delay or cancellation of customer orders, delays or interruptions of the supply of raw materials, and bankruptcy of customers or suppliers. The occurrence of any of these events may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nShortages of skilled labor, increased labor costs, or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our financial results.\nWe depend on skilled labor for the manufacture of our products. Our continued success depends on the active participation of our key employees. Some of our facilities are located in areas where demand for skilled labor often exceeds supply. Shortages of some types of skilled labor, such as electricians and qualified maintenance technicians, could restrict our ability to maintain or increase production rates, lead to production inefficiencies and increase our labor costs. Our shift to the \"best of both\" strategy would also require a set of job skills that is different from our prior needs. The competitive nature of the labor markets in which we operate, the cyclical nature of the steel industry and the resulting employment needs increase our risk of not being able to recruit, train and retain the employees we require at efficient costs and on reasonable terms, particularly when the economy expands, production rates are high or competition for such skilled labor increases. Many companies, including U. S. Steel, have had employee lay-offs as a result of reduced business activities in an industry downturn. The loss of our key people or our inability to attract new key employees could adversely affect our operations. Additionally, layoffs or other adverse actions could result in an adverse relationship with our workforce or third party labor providers. If we are unable to recruit, train and retain adequate numbers of qualified employees and third party labor providers on a timely basis or at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur 2018 Labor Agreements with the USW contain provisions that may impact certain business activities.\nOur 2018 Labor Agreements with the USW contain provisions that grant the USW a limited right to bid on the Company\u2019s sale of a facility (or sale of a controlling interest in an entity owning a facility) covered by the 2018 Labor Agreements, excluding public equity offerings and/or the transfer of assets between U. S. Steel and its wholly owned subsidiaries. These agreements also require a minimum level of capital expenditures (subject to approval of the Board of Directors) to maintain the competitive status of the covered facilities, and place certain limited restrictions on our ability to replace product produced at a covered facility with product produced at other than Company facilities or affiliates or U.S. or Canadian facilities with employee protections similar to the protections found in the 2018 Labor Agreements when the Company is operating covered facilities below capacity. These provisions could favorably or unfavorably impact certain business activities including pricing, operating costs, margins, and/or our competitiveness in the marketplace.\nA failure of our information technology infrastructure and cybersecurity threats may adversely affect our business operations.\nDespite efforts to protect confidential business information, personal data of employees and contractors, and the control systems of manufacturing plants, U. S. Steel systems and those of our third-party service providers have been and may be subject to cyber-attacks or system breaches. System breaches can lead to theft, unauthorized disclosure, modification or destruction of proprietary business data, personally identifiable information (PII), or other sensitive information, and to defective products, production downtime and damage to production assets, with a resulting impact to our reputation, competitiveness and operations. We have experienced cybersecurity attacks that have resulted in unauthorized persons gaining access to our information technology systems and networks, and we could in the future experience similar attacks. To date, no cybersecurity attack has had a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nWhile the Company continually works to safeguard our systems and mitigate potential risks, there can be no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent cyber-attacks or security breaches or mitigate all potential risks to our systems, networks and data. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity attack include reputational damage, litigation with third parties, disruption to our systems, unauthorized release of confidential, personally\nidentifiable, or otherwise protected information, corruption of data, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness, results of operations and financial condition. The amount of insurance coverage we maintain may be inadequate to cover claims or liabilities resulting from a cybersecurity attack.\nWe depend on third parties for transportation services, and increases in costs or the availability of transportation may adversely affect our business and operations.\nOur business depends on the transportation of a large number of products, both domestically and internationally. We rely primarily on third parties for transportation of the products we manufacture as well as delivery of our raw materials. Any increase in the cost of the transportation of our raw materials or products, as a result of increases in fuel or labor costs, higher demand for logistics services, consolidation in the transportation industry or otherwise, may adversely affect our results of operations as we may not be able to pass such cost increases on to our customers.\nIf any of these providers were to fail to deliver raw materials to us in a timely manner, we may be unable to manufacture and deliver our products in response to customer demand. In addition, if any of these third parties were to cease operations or cease doing business with us, we may be unable to replace them at a reasonable cost.\nIn addition, such failure of a third-party transportation provider could harm our reputation, negatively affect our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nBenefits from our \"best of both\" stockholder value creation strategy and asset revitalization program may be limited or may not be fully realized.\nU. S. Steel is pursuing a stockholder value creation strategy focused on delivering an enhanced \u201cbest of both\u201d business model that delivers cost and/or capability differentiation for our customers. This includes investing in new assets and technologies to leverage the advantages of integrated and mini mill capabilities. This strategy builds on our asset revitalization program, launched in 2017, which covers investments in our existing assets, and involves investments beyond routine capital and maintenance spending. Asset revitalization projects have delivered, and are expected to deliver, both operational and commercial benefits, but such benefits may be limited to the assets that are revitalized. Business conditions, our ability to implement such initiatives, and factors beyond our control may limit the benefits associated with certain identified projects and limit the economic benefits of our stockholder value creation strategy or asset revitalization program. Our goal remains to deliver high-quality, value-added products on time every time and to collaborate with our customers to develop innovative solutions that address their most challenging needs.\nWe participate in joint ventures, which may not be successful.\nWe participate in a number of joint ventures and we may enter into additional joint ventures or other similar arrangements in the future. Our joint venture partners, as well as any future partners, may have interests that are different from ours which could result in conflicting views as to the conduct of the business of the joint venture. In the event that we have a disagreement with a joint venture partner as to the resolution of a particular issue, or as to the management or conduct of the business of the joint venture in general, we may not be able to resolve such disagreement in our favor. In addition, our joint venture partners may, as a result of financial or other difficulties or because of other reasons, be unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations under the joint venture, such as contributing capital to expansion or maintenance projects or approving dividends or other distributions or payments to us. Any significant downturn or deterioration in the business, financial condition or results of operations of a joint venture could adversely affect our results of operations in a particular period. There can be no assurance that our joint ventures will be beneficial to us.\nFinancial Risk Factors\nOur business requires substantial expenditures for debt service obligations, capital investments, operating leases and maintenance that we may be unable to fund.\nWe have approximately $3.6 billion of total debt (see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), including $600 million of outstanding borrowings under our Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and $393 million of outstanding borrowings under our USSK Credit Agreement. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may face substantial liquidity problems and may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, or issue additional debt or equity. We may not be able to take such actions, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our inability to\ngenerate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results or operations and may place us at a competitive disadvantage with competitors who may have less indebtedness and other obligations or greater access to financing.\nOur ability to service or refinance our debt or fund investments and capital expenditures required to maintain or expand our business operations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to satisfy our liquidity needs. In addition, the availability under our Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement may be reduced if we have insufficient collateral, or if we do not meet a customary fixed charge coverage test. Availability under the USSK Credit Agreement could be limited if USSK does not meet certain financial covenants. See the Liquidity section in \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis\" and Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.\nOur business and execution of our strategic priorities require us to raise capital which could be difficult if we face depressed market conditions, lower earnings or credit rating downgrades by ratings agencies.\nExecuting on our strategic priorities will require us to raise additional capital, which we may seek through debt financing or the public or private sale of debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to secure sources of financing at a particular time or on particular or favorable terms. Additionally, we may seek to raise funds through the divestiture or monetization of certain non-core assets. We cannot be assured that we will be able to find an attractive or acceptable partner for such transactions, or if we do, that we will be able to reach agreement on favorable or mutually satisfactory terms. Any decline in our operating results or downgrades in our credit ratings may make raising capital or entering into any business transaction more difficult, lead to reductions in the availability of credit or increased cost of credit, adversely affect the terms of future borrowings, and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities.\nWe have significant retiree health care, retiree life insurance and pension plan costs, which may negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe maintain retiree health care and life insurance and defined benefit pension plans covering many of our domestic employees and former employees upon their retirement. Some of these benefit plans are not fully funded, and thus will require cash funding in future years. Minimum contributions to domestic qualified pension plans (other than contributions to the Steelworkers Pension Trust (SPT) described below) are regulated under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA).\nThe level of cash funding for our defined benefit pension plans in future years depends upon various factors, including voluntary contributions that we may make, future pension plan asset performance, actual interest rates under the law, and the impacts of business acquisitions or divestitures, union negotiated benefit changes and future government regulations, many of which are not within our control. In addition, assets held by the trusts for our pension plan and our trust for retiree health care and life insurance benefits are subject to the risks, uncertainties and variability of the financial markets. Future funding requirements could also be materially affected by differences between expected and actual returns on plan assets, actuarial data and assumptions relating to plan participants, the discount rate used to measure the pension obligations and changes to regulatory funding requirements. See \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis\" and Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of assumptions and further information associated with these benefit plans.\nU. S. Steel contributes to a domestic multiemployer defined benefit pension plan, the SPT, for USW-represented employees formerly employed by National Steel and represented employees hired after May 2003. We have legal requirements for future funding of this plan should the SPT become significantly underfunded or we decide to withdraw from the plan. Either of these scenarios may negatively impact our future cash flows. The 2018 Labor Agreements increased the contribution rate for most steelworker employees. Collectively bargained company contributions to the plan could increase further as a result of future changes agreed to by the Company and the USW.\nThe accounting treatment of equity method investments and other long-lived assets could result in future asset impairments, which would reduce our earnings.\nWe periodically test our equity method investments and other long-lived assets to determine whether their estimated fair value is less than their value recorded on our balance sheet. The results of this testing for potential impairment may be adversely affected by uncertain market conditions for the global steel industry and general economic conditions. If we determine that the fair value of any of these assets is less than the value recorded on our balance sheet, and, in the case of equity method investments the decline is other than temporary, we would likely incur a non-cash impairment loss that would negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe are subject to foreign currency risks, which may negatively impact our profitability and cash flows.\nThe financial condition and results of operations of USSE are reported in euros and then translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rate for inclusion in our financial statements. The appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro negatively affects our Consolidated Results of Operations. International cash requirements have been and in the future may be funded by intercompany loans, which may create intercompany monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than the functional currencies of the entities involved, which can have a non-cash impact on income when they are remeasured at the end of each period.\nIn addition, foreign producers, including foreign producers of subsidized or unfairly traded steel with foreign currency denominated costs may gain additional competitive advantages or target our home markets if the U.S. dollar or euro exchange rates strengthen relative to those producers' currencies. Volatility in the markets and exchange rates for foreign currencies and contracts in foreign currencies could have a significant impact on our reported financial results and condition.\nFinancial regulatory frameworks introduced by U.S. and EU regulators may limit our financial flexibility or increase our costs.\nWe use swaps, forward contracts and similar agreements to mitigate our exposure to volatility, which entails a variety of risks. The Commodity Future Trading Commission\u2019s Dodd Frank and the EU\u2019s European Market Infrastructure Regulation and other government agencies' regulatory frameworks can limit the Company\u2019s ability to hedge interest rate, foreign exchange (FX), or commodity pricing exposures, which could expose us to increased economic risk. These frameworks may introduce additional compliance costs or liquidity requirements. Some counterparties may cease hedging as a result of increased regulatory cost burdens, which in turn may reduce U. S. Steel\u2019s ability to hedge its interest rate, FX, or commodity exposures.\nWe are a party to various legal proceedings, the resolution of which could negatively affect our profitability and cash flows in a particular period.\nWe are involved at any given time in various litigation matters, including administrative and regulatory proceedings, governmental investigations, environmental matters, and commercial disputes. Our profitability and cash flows in a particular period could be negatively affected by an adverse ruling or settlement in any legal proceeding or investigation that is pending against us or filed against us in the future. While we believe that we have taken appropriate actions to mitigate and reduce these risks, due to the nature of our operations, these risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings or investigations may arise from time to time.\nAdditionally, we may be subject to product liability claims that may have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Events such as well failures, line pipe leaks, blowouts, bursts, fires and product recalls could result in claims that our products or services were defective and caused death, personal injury, property damage or environmental pollution. The insurance we maintain may not be adequate, available to protect us in the event of a claim, or its coverage may be limited, canceled or otherwise terminated, or the amount of our insurance may be less than the related impact on our enterprise value after a loss. We establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies, including contingencies for claims asserted against us in connection with litigation, arbitrations and environmental issues. Adverse developments in litigation, arbitrations, environmental issues or other legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments in excess of our reserves, which could negatively affect our operations, financial results and cash flows. See \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings\" and Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.\nRegulatory Risk Factors\nCompliance with existing and new environmental regulations, environmental permitting and approval requirements may result in delays or other adverse impacts on planned projects, our results of operations and cash flows.\nSteel producers in the U.S., along with their customers and suppliers, are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations concern the generation, storage, transportation, disposal, emission or discharge of pollutants, contaminants and hazardous substances into the environment, the reporting of such matters, and the general protection of public health and safety, natural resources, wildlife and the environment. Steel producers in the EU are subject to similar laws. These laws continue to evolve and are becoming increasingly stringent. The ultimate impact of complying with such laws and regulations is not always clearly known or determinable because regulations under some of these laws have not yet been promulgated or are undergoing revision. Additionally, compliance with certain of these laws and regulations, such as the CAA and similar state and local requirements, governing SO2 and other emissions, could result in substantially increased capital requirements and operating costs. Compliance with current or future regulations could entail substantial costs for emission based systems, and could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. Failure to comply with the requirements may result in administrative, civil and criminal penalties, revocation of permits to conduct business or construct certain facilities, substantial fines or sanctions, enforcement actions (including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures), natural resource damages claims, cleanup and closure costs, and third-party claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws, regulations, codes and common law. The amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict, and, in some cases, liability may be imposed without regard to contribution or to whether we knew of, or caused, the release of hazardous substances.\nIn addition, the Company must obtain, maintain and comply with numerous permits, leases, approvals, consents and certificates from various governmental authorities in connection with the construction and operation of new production facilities or modifications to existing facilities. In connection with such activities, the Company may need to make significant capital and operating expenditures to detect, repair and/or control air emissions, to control water discharges or to perform certain corrective actions to meet the conditions of the permits issued pursuant to applicable environmental laws and regulations.\nThere can be no assurance that future approvals, licenses and permits will be granted or that we will be able to maintain and renew the approvals, licenses and permits we currently hold. Failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, compliance with the environmental permitting and approval requirements may be costly and time consuming and could result in delays or other adverse impacts on planned projects, our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have significant environmental remediation costs that negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nSome of U. S. Steel's current and former facilities were in operation before 1900. Hazardous materials associated with those facilities have been and may continue to be released at current or former operating sites or delivered to sites operated by third parties.\nU. S. Steel is involved in numerous remediation projects at currently operating facilities, facilities that have been closed or sold to unrelated parties and other sites where material generated by U. S. Steel was deposited. In addition, there are numerous other former operating or disposal sites that could become the subject of remediation, which may negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nIncreasing pressure to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from steelmaking operations to comply with EU regulations as well as societal expectations could increase costs to manufacture future materials or reduce the amount of materials being manufactured.\nIron and steel producers around the world are facing mounting pressure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from operations. The majority of greenhouse gas emissions from the production of iron and steel are caused by the combustion of fossil fuels, the use of electrical energy, and the use of coal, lime, and iron ore as feedstock. The two main production processes are the integrated route of blast furnace ironmaking in combination with basic oxygen furnace steelmaking (BOF) and the alternative route of electric arc furnace steelmaking. Both routes generate greenhouse gas emissions with the latter process, involving the electric arc melting of a majority of steel scrap, generating less than half that, or less, of the traditional integrated steelmaking process.\nAdditionally, the European Union has established aggressive CO2 reduction targets of 40% by 2030, against a 1990 baseline, and full carbon neutrality by 2050. An emission trading system (ETS) was established to encourage compliance with set emissions reduction targets. These aggressive targets require drastic measures within the steel industry to comply. The price of CO2 emission allowances is currently at 24 euro per metric ton and forecasts call for potential price increase to 40 euro per metric ton. The transition to EAF technology, as well as incremental gains in energy reduction, use of renewable energy and continued asset and process improvements (including EAF steelmaking), are expected to reduce our GHG footprint. However, the development of breakthrough technologies are likely required to continue the path of low to no carbon footprint in the steel industry. Implementation of new technologies will most likely require significant amounts of capital and an abundant source of low cost hydrogen and/or green power, most likely leading to an increase in the cost of future steelmaking. In addition, the cost of emission allowances is forecast to increase, along with the number of allowances decreasing in the next several years.\nOur activities are subject to complex regulatory and compliance frameworks.\nThe need to comply with complex laws and regulations that apply to our international activities, including, but not limited to, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, economic sanctions, and other import and export laws and regulations, may increase our cost of doing business and expose the Company and its employees to elevated risk. The Company's subsidiaries and joint ventures may face similar risks. Although we have implemented policies and processes designed to comply with these laws and regulations, failure by our employees, contractors, or agents to comply with these laws and regulations can result in possible administrative, civil, or criminal liability, as well as reputational harm to the Company and its employees.\nNew and changing data privacy laws and cross-border transfer requirements could have a negative impact on our business and operations.\nOur business depends on the processing and transfer of data between our affiliated entities, to and from our business partners, and with third-party service providers, which may be subject to data privacy laws and cross-border transfer restrictions. In North America and Europe, new legislation and changes to the requirements or applicability of existing laws, as well as evolving standards and judicial and regulatory interpretations of such laws, may impact U. S. Steel\u2019s ability to effectively process and transfer data across borders in support of our business operations and/or keep pace with specific requirements regarding safeguarding personal information. While U. S. Steel takes steps to comply with these legal requirements, non-compliance could lead to possible administrative, civil, or criminal liability, as well as reputational harm to the Company and its employees. For example, the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which went into effect in May 2018, created a range of new compliance obligations for subject companies and increases financial penalties for non-compliance. The costs of compliance with privacy laws such as the GDPR and the potential for fines and penalties in the event of a breach may have a negative impact on our business and operations.", "PERMNO": 76644, "SIC": 3312, "TIC": "X"}
