{"cik": "936468", "company": "LOCKHEED MARTIN CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-01-28", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties. We seek to identify, manage and mitigate risks to our business, but risk and uncertainty cannot be eliminated or necessarily predicted. The outcome of one or more of these risks could have a material effect on our operating results, financial position, or cash flows. You should carefully consider the following factors, in addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to purchase our common stock or debt securities.\nRisks Related to our Reliance on Government Contracts\nWe depend heavily on contracts with the U.S. Government, including contracts related to the program, for a substantial portion of our business. Changes in the U.S. Government\u2019s priorities and delays or reductions in spending could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe derived 74% of our total net sales from the U.S. Government in 2020, including 64% from the DoD. We expect to continue to derive most of our sales from work performed under U.S. Government contracts. Those contracts are conditioned upon the continuing availability of Congressional appropriations. Congress usually appropriates funds on a fiscal year (FY) basis even though contract performance may extend over many years. Consequently, contracts are often partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as Congress makes further appropriations. If we incur costs in excess of funds obligated on a contract, we may be at risk for reimbursement of those costs unless and until additional funds are obligated to the contract.\nThe program, which consists of multiple development, production and sustainment contracts, is our largest program. It represented 28% of our total net sales in 2020. A decision by the U.S. Government or other governments to cut spending on this program or reduce or delay planned orders would have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Given the size and complexity of the program, we anticipate that there will be continual reviews related to aircraft performance, program schedule, cost, and requirements as part of the DoD, Congressional, and international partners\u2019 oversight and budgeting processes. Current program challenges include, but are not limited to, supplier and partner performance (including COVID-19 related challenges), software development, the availability and receipt of funding for contracts on a timely basis, execution of future flight tests and findings resulting from testing and operating the aircraft, the level of cost associated with life-cycle operations and sustainment and warranties, continuing to reduce the unit production costs, and achieving cost targets.\nBudget uncertainty, the risk of future budget cuts, the potential for U.S. government shutdowns, the use of continuing resolutions, and the federal debt ceiling can adversely affect our industry and the funding for our programs. If a government\nshutdown were to occur and were to continue for an extended period of time, we could be at risk of program cancellations and other disruptions and nonpayment. If the U.S. Government operates under a continuing resolution, new contract and program starts are restricted and funding for our programs may be unavailable, reduced or delayed. Shifting funding priorities, including COVID-19 related spending, or federal budget compromises, could also result in reductions in overall defense spending which could adversely impact our business. Our business could also be adversely impacted by reductions or delays in spending by non-U.S. government customers who are facing budget pressures.\nWe believe our diverse range of products and services generally make it less likely that cuts in any specific contract or program will affect our business on a long-term basis. However, termination of multiple or large programs or contracts could adversely affect our business and future financial performance. Changes in funding priorities may afford new or additional opportunities for our businesses in terms of existing, follow-on or replacement programs, but could also reduce opportunities in existing programs and in planned programs where we intend to compete. While we would expect to compete and be well positioned as the incumbent on existing programs, we may not be successful or, even if successful, the replacement programs may be funded at lower levels.\nWe are subject to a number of procurement laws and regulations, including the U.S. Government\u2019s ability to terminate contracts for convenience. Our business and reputation could be adversely affected if we or those we do business with fail to comply with these laws.\nWe must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of U.S. Government contracts. Government contract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and impose certain risks and costs on our business. A violation of these laws and regulations by us, our employees, others working on our behalf, a supplier or a joint venture partner could harm our reputation and result in the imposition of fines and penalties, the termination of our contracts, suspension or debarment from bidding on or being awarded contracts, loss of our ability to export products or perform services and civil or criminal investigations or proceedings. In addition, costs to comply with new government regulations can increase our costs, reduce our margins and affect our competitiveness.\nIn some instances, these laws and regulations impose terms or obligations that are different than those typically found in commercial transactions. For example, the U.S. Government may terminate any of our government contracts and subcontracts not only for default based on our performance but also at its convenience. Upon termination for convenience of a fixed-price type contract, typically we are entitled to receive the purchase price for delivered items, reimbursement for allowable costs for work-in-process and an allowance for profit on the contract or adjustment for loss if completion of performance would have resulted in a loss.\nUpon termination for convenience of a cost-reimbursable contract, we normally are entitled to reimbursement of allowable costs plus a portion of the fee, and allowable costs include our cost to terminate agreements with our suppliers and subcontractors. The amount of the fee recovered, if any, is related to the portion of the work accomplished prior to termination and is determined by negotiation. We attempt to ensure that adequate funds are available by notifying the customer when its estimated costs, including those associated with a possible termination for convenience, approach levels specified as being allotted to its programs. As funds are typically appropriated on a fiscal year basis, and because the costs of a termination for convenience may exceed the costs of continuing a program in a given fiscal year, programs occasionally do not have sufficient funds appropriated to cover the termination costs if the government were to terminate them for convenience. Under such circumstances, the U.S. Government could assert that it is not required to appropriate additional funding.\nA termination arising out of our default may expose us to liability and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders. In addition, on those contracts for which we are teamed with others and are not the prime contractor, the U.S. Government could terminate a prime contract under which we are a subcontractor, notwithstanding the fact that our performance and the quality of the products or services we delivered were consistent with our contractual obligations as a subcontractor. In the case of termination for default, the U.S. Government could make claims to reduce the contract value or recover its procurement costs and could assess other special penalties. Under such circumstances we may have rights and there may be remedial actions available to us under applicable laws and the FAR.\nAdditionally, our programs for the U.S. Government often operate for periods of time under Undefinitized Contract Actions (UCAs), which means that we begin performing our obligations before the terms, specifications or price are finally agreed to between the parties. The U.S. Government has the ability to unilaterally definitize contracts, which, absent a successful appeal, obligates us to perform under terms and conditions imposed by the U.S. Government. The U.S. Government has unilaterally definitized contracts with us in the past, most notably the LRIP 9 contract in 2016 and more recently two FMS upgrade proposals in 2020, and may do so in the future. The U.S. Government\u2019s power to unilaterally definitize a contract can affect our ability to negotiate mutually agreeable contract terms and, if a contract is unilaterally imposed upon us, it may negatively affect our expected profit and cash flows on a program or impose burdensome terms.\nCertain of our U.S. Government contracts span one or more base years and include multiple option years. The U.S. Government generally has the right not to exercise option periods and may decide not to exercise an option period for various reasons. The U.S. Government also may decide to exercise option periods for contracts under which it is expected that our costs may exceed the contract price or ceiling, which could result in losses or unreimbursed costs.\nEvolving U.S. Government procurement policies and increased emphasis on cost over performance and rapid acquisition could adversely affect our business.\nThe U.S. Government could implement procurement policies that negatively impact our profitability or the ability to win new business. Changes in procurement policy favoring more incentive-based fee arrangements, different award fee criteria or government contract negotiation offers based upon the customer\u2019s view of what our costs should be (as compared to our actual costs) may affect the predictability of our profit rates or make it more difficult to compete on certain types of programs. Our customers also may pursue non-traditional contract provisions or contract types in negotiation of contracts. The U.S. Government\u2019s preference for fixed-price contracting has resulted in what we believe to be the inappropriate application of fixed-priced contracting methods to development programs. By their nature, the technical challenges, costs and timing of development programs are difficult to estimate and the use of fixed-price instead of cost-reimbursable contracts for such programs increases the financial risk to the contractor. This increased risk may lead to losses on fixed price development programs or may cause us not to bid on future fixed-price development programs, which could adversely affect our future growth prospects and financial performance. In addition, given the customer\u2019s emphasis on cost, even if we effectively manage program life-cycle and sustainment costs and meet customer affordability targets, the customer may elect to recompete programs at the end of existing contracts, which may result in a lost business opportunity. From time to time, the U.S. Government also has proposed contract terms or taken positions that represent fundamental changes from historical practices or that we believe are inconsistent with the FAR or other laws and regulations and which could adversely affect our business.\nThe DoD also is increasingly pursuing rapid development and acquisition of new technologies through rapid acquisition pathways and procedures, including through other transaction authority agreements (OTAs). While OTAs do not currently represent a significant portion of our overall contracts (less than 2% of total backlog), in recent years the DoD has increased the frequency of use and size of OTAs and we expect this trend to continue in the future. OTAs are exempt from many traditional procurement laws, including the FAR, and may be used, subject to certain conditions, for research, prototype development and follow on production for a successful prototype. The conditions to award OTAs include, in certain instances, that a significant portion of the work under the OTA is performed by a non-traditional defense contractor or that a portion of the cost of the protype project is funded by non-governmental sources. If we cannot successfully adapt to the DoD\u2019s rapid acquisition processes or if the DoD significantly increases the use of OTAs with non-traditional defense contractors or increasingly mandates cost sharing, then we may lose strategic new business opportunities in high-growth areas and our future performance and results could be adversely affected. Shorter life-cycle technologies rather than large platforms could also make our existing portfolio less competitive in the future.\nAs recommended by a June 2019 U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) Report on contract financing, the DoD has stated that it will conduct a comprehensive assessment of the effect that DoD contract financing and profit policies have on the defense industry. We have no assurance regarding the full scope and recurrence of any study and what changes will be proposed, if any, and their impact on our working capital, cash flow, profit or results of operation. Earlier changes proposed by the DoD in 2018 and later withdrawn would have had a negative effect on the timing of our cash flows.\nWe are routinely subject to audit by our customers on government contracts and the results of those audits could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations.\nU.S. Government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency, the Defense Contract Management Agency and various agency Inspectors General, routinely audit and investigate government contractors. These agencies review a contractor\u2019s performance under its contracts, its cost structure, its business systems and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. The U.S. Government has the ability to decrease or withhold certain payments when it deems systems subject to its review to be inadequate. Additionally, any costs found to be misclassified may be subject to repayment and from time to time we have had substantial disagreements with government auditors regarding the allowability of costs incurred by us under government contracts, which further delays payments even if we are correct in our positions. We have unaudited or unsettled incurred cost claims related to past years, which limits our ability to issue final billings on contracts for which authorized and appropriated funds may be expiring or can result in substantial delays in final billings and our ability to close out a contract.\nIf an audit or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including reductions of the value of contracts, contract modifications or terminations, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, penalties, fines, suspension, or prohibition from doing business with the U.S. Government. In\naddition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us. Similar government oversight exists in most other countries where we conduct business.\nOur profitability and cash flow may vary based on the mix of our contracts and programs, our performance, and our ability to control costs.\nOur profitability and cash flow may vary materially depending on the types of government contracts undertaken, the nature of products produced or services performed under those contracts, the costs incurred in performing the work, the achievement of other performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees is determined, particularly under award and incentive-fee contracts. Failure to perform to customer expectations and contract requirements may result in reduced fees or losses and may adversely affect our financial performance. Our backlog includes a variety of contract types and represents the sales we expect to recognize for our products and services in the future.\nContract types primarily include fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts. Under each type of contract, if we are unable to control costs, our operating results could be adversely affected, particularly if we are unable to justify an increase in contract value to our customers. Cost overruns or the failure to perform on existing programs also may adversely affect our ability to retain existing programs and win future contract awards.\nUnder fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform specified work for a pre-determined price. To the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, we will generate more or less profit or could incur a loss. Some fixed-price contracts have a performance-based component under which we may earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based on our performance.\nCost-reimbursable contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a fee up to a ceiling based on the amount that has been funded. Typically, we enter into three types of cost-reimbursable contracts: cost-plus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, and cost-plus-fixed-fee. Cost-plus-award-fee contracts provide for an award fee that varies within specified limits based on the customer\u2019s assessment of our performance against a predetermined set of criteria, such as targets based on cost, quality, technical and schedule criteria. Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fee that is adjusted by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs (i.e., incentive based on cost) or reimbursement of costs plus an incentive to exceed stated performance targets (i.e., incentive based on performance). The fixed-fee in a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract is negotiated at the inception of the contract and that fixed-fee does not vary with actual costs.\nContracts for development programs with complex design and technical challenges are often cost-reimbursable. In these cases, the associated financial risks primarily relate to a reduction in fees and the program could be canceled if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Other contracts included in our backlog are for the transition from development to production (e.g., LRIP contracts), which includes the challenge of starting and stabilizing a manufacturing production and test line while the final design is being validated and managing change in requirements or capabilities. These contracts frequently are cost-reimbursable or fixed-price incentive-fee contracts. Generally, if our costs exceed the contract target cost or are not allowable under the applicable regulations, we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for all costs and may have our fees reduced or eliminated. There are also contracts for production, as well as operations and maintenance of the delivered products, that have the challenge of achieving a stable production and delivery rate, while maintaining operability of the product after delivery. These contracts are primarily fixed-price. In addition, certain contracts associated with our Space business segment contain provisions that require us to forfeit fees, pay penalties, or provide replacement systems in the event of performance failure, which could negatively affect our earnings and cash flows.\nIncreased competition and bid protests in a budget-constrained environment may make it more difficult to maintain our financial performance and customer relationships.\nA substantial portion of our business is awarded through competitive bidding. The U.S. Government increasingly has relied on competitive contract award types, including indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity and other multi-award contracts, which have the potential to create pricing pressure and to increase our costs by requiring us to submit multiple bids and proposals. Multi-award contracts require us to make sustained efforts to obtain task orders under the contract. Additionally, competitive bids that do not contain cost-realism evaluation criteria can lead to competitors taking aggressive pricing positions. The competitive bidding process entails substantial costs and managerial time to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us or may be split among competitors. The U.S. Government also may not award us large competitive contracts that we otherwise might have won in an effort to maintain a broader industrial base.\nEven if we are successful in obtaining an award, we may encounter bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards. Unsuccessful bidders may protest in the hope of being awarded a subcontract for a portion of the work in return for\nwithdrawing the protest. Bid protests could result in significant expenses to us, contract modifications or even loss of the contract award. Even where a bid protest does not result in the loss of a contract award, the resolution can extend the time until contract activity can begin and, as a result, delay the recognition of sales. We also may not be successful in our efforts to protest or challenge any bids for contracts that were not awarded to us and we could incur significant time and expense in such efforts.\nWe are experiencing increased competition, including from emerging non-traditional competitors, while, at the same time, many of our customers are facing significant budget pressures, trying to do more with less by cutting costs, using fixed price contracts, deferring large procurements, identifying more affordable solutions, performing certain work internally rather than hiring contractors, and reducing product development cycles. If emerging competitors can offer faster or lower cost services and products at equivalent or even reduced capabilities, then we may lose new business opportunities or contract recompetes, which could adversely affect our future results. Our success in competing and remaining cost-competitive may depend on our ability to adopt and integrate new digital manufacturing and operating technologies and tools into our product lifecycles and processes. Furthermore, acquisitions in our industry, particularly vertical integration by tier-1 prime contractors, could also result in increased competition or limit our access to certain suppliers. To remain competitive, we must maintain consistently strong customer relationships, seek to understand customer priorities and provide superior performance, advanced technology solutions and services at an affordable cost with the agility that our customers require to satisfy their mission objectives in an increasingly price competitive environment.\nOther Risks Related to our Operations\nThe effects of COVID-19 and other potential future public health crises, epidemics, pandemics or similar events on our business, operating results and cash flows are uncertain.\nThe global outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has negatively affected the U.S. and global economies, disrupted global supply chains, resulted in significant travel and transport restrictions, including mandated closures and orders to \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d and quarantine restrictions. The pandemic has presented unprecedented business challenges, and we have experienced impacts in each of our business areas related to COVID-19, primarily in increased coronavirus-related costs, delays in supplier deliveries, impacts of travel restrictions, site access and quarantine requirements, and the impacts of remote work and adjusted work schedules. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance, including our ability to execute our programs in the expected timeframe, remains uncertain and will depend on future pandemic related developments, including the duration of the pandemic, any potential subsequent waves of COVID-19 infection, the effectiveness, distribution and acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines, and related government actions to prevent and manage disease spread, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. The long-term impacts of COVID-19 on government budgets and other funding priorities, including international priorities, that impact demand for our products and services and our business are also difficult to predict.\nIn accordance with the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s identification of the Defense Industrial Base as a critical infrastructure sector in March 2020, our U.S. production facilities have continued to operate during the pandemic, however, our operations have been adjusted in response to the pandemic, including, most significantly, a reduction in the production rate primarily due to supplier delays. Staffing levels at our facilities, our customer facilities, and our supplier facilities have and could continue to fluctuate as a result of COVID-19, which could negatively impact our business. In addition, countries other than the U.S. have different responses to the pandemic that can affect our international operations and the operations of our suppliers and customers. Base closures, travel restrictions, and quarantine requirements both within and outside the U.S. have affected our normal operations and resulted in some schedule delays and future or prolonged occurrences of these could adversely affect our ability to achieve future contract milestones and our results of operations.\nAs described in the risk factor below, we rely on other companies and the U.S. Government to provide materials, major components and products, and to perform a portion of the services that are provided to our customers under the terms of most of our contracts. Many of these suppliers also supply parts for commercial aviation businesses which have been more significantly impacted by the pandemic due to the impacts on these markets. Global supply chain disruption caused by the response to COVID-19 has impacted some of our programs and could impact our ability to perform on our contracts, in particular in instances where there is not a qualified second source of supply. We have identified a number of suppliers that have experienced delivery impacts due to COVID-19 and have been working to manage those impacts. However, if alternatives or other mitigations are not effective, deliveries and other milestones on affected programs could be adversely impacted.\nDelays in inspection, acceptance and payment by our customers, many of whom are teleworking, could also affect our sales and cash flows. This is particularly an issue with respect to classified work that is unable to be done remotely. Limitations on government operations can also impact regulatory approvals such as export licenses that are needed for international sales and deliveries. In addition, we could experience delays in new program starts or awards of future work as well as the uncertain\nimpact of contract modifications to respond to the pandemic. Limitations on travel to customers could impact international orders. We have been granted some travel exemptions to allow us to continue certain activities but we have no assurance that they will continue or additional restrictions will not be imposed. If significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, absenteeism, government actions, facility closures, travel restrictions or other restrictions due to COVID-19, our operations will be impacted and this could create risks to the effectiveness of our internal controls. Additionally, we have not previously experienced such a significant portion of our workforce working remotely for a prolonged period, so its effects on our long-term operations are unknown. The impact of COVID-19 could worsen depending on the duration and spread of the COVID-19 pandemic or potential subsequent waves of COVID-19 infection in affected regions after they have begun to experience improvement.\nCoronavirus-related costs for us and our suppliers are significant and we are seeking reimbursement of coronavirus-related costs under our U.S. Government contracts through a combination of equitable adjustments to the contract price and reimbursement of the costs under Section 3610 of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), which allows federal agencies to reimburse contractors for certain COVID-19 related costs from March 27, 2020 through March 31, 2021. These cost increases, including costs for employees whose jobs cannot be performed remotely and for certain costs incurred prior to March 27, 2020, may not be fully recoverable under our contracts, particularly fixed-price contracts, or adequately covered by insurance. We also have no assurance that Congress will appropriate funds to cover the reimbursement of defense contractors authorized by the CARES Act, which could reduce funds available for other U.S. Government defense priorities.\nThe continued spread of COVID-19 has also led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which depending on future developments could impact our capital resources and liquidity in the future and the investment returns on our pension assets. We are also monitoring the impacts of COVID-19 on the fair value of our assets. While we do not currently anticipate any material impairments on our assets as a result of COVID-19, future changes in expectations for sales, earnings and cash flows related to intangible assets and goodwill below our current projections could cause these assets to be impaired.\nFor more information on the effect of COVID-19 on our operations and our response to COVID-19, see Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nWe are the prime contractor on most of our contracts and if our subcontractors, suppliers or teaming agreement or joint venture partners fail to perform their obligations, our performance and our ability to win future business could be harmed.\nWe rely on other companies to provide materials, major components and products, and to perform a portion of the services that are provided to our customers under the terms of most of our contracts. These arrangements may involve subcontracts, teaming arrangements, joint ventures or supply agreements with other companies upon which we rely (contracting parties). There is a risk that the contracting party does not perform at all or to our expectations or meet affordability targets and we may have disputes with our contracting parties, including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed, the workshare provided to that party, customer concerns about the other party\u2019s performance, our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders, or our hiring the personnel of a subcontractor, teammate or joint venture partner or vice versa. We could also be adversely affected by actions by or issues experienced by our contracting parties that are outside of our control, such as misconduct and reputational issues involving our contracting parties, which could subject us to liability or adversely affect our ability to compete for contract awards.\nChanges in the economic environment, including the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical events, defense budgets, trade sanctions and constraints on available financing, and the highly competitive and budget constrained environment in which we operate, may adversely affect the financial stability and viability of our contracting parties or their ability to meet their performance requirements or to provide needed supplies or services on a timely basis. Some scarce raw materials required for our products are largely controlled by a single country, including rare earth minerals that are largely controlled by China, and therefore can be adversely impacted by potential trade actions involving that country. Additionally, our efforts to increase the efficiency of our operations and improve the affordability of our products and services could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain suppliers. We must comply with specific procurement requirements which can limit the available suppliers and we do not have secondary suppliers for some supplies and the qualification of new or additional suppliers can under some circumstances take an extended period of time.\nA failure, for whatever reason, by one or more of our contracting parties to provide the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed-upon services on a timely basis, according to specifications, or at all, may affect our ability to perform our obligations and require that we transition the work to other companies. Contracting party performance deficiencies may result in additional costs or delays in product deliveries and affect our operating results and could result in a customer terminating our contract for default or convenience. A default termination could expose us to liability and affect our ability to compete for\nfuture contracts and orders. A failure by our contracting parties to meet affordability targets could negatively affect our profitability, result in contract losses and affect our ability to win new business.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to develop new technologies, products and services and efficiently produce and deliver existing products.\nMany of the products and services we provide are highly engineered and involve sophisticated technologies with related complex manufacturing and system integration processes. Our customers\u2019 requirements change and evolve regularly. Accordingly, our future performance depends, in part, on our ability to adapt to changing customer needs rapidly, identify emerging technological trends, develop and manufacture innovative products and services efficiently and bring those offerings to market quickly at cost-effective prices. This includes efforts to implement emerging digital and network technologies and capabilities. To advance our innovation, we may seek to collaborate with commercial entities that are not accustomed to government contracting and these entities may be unwilling to agree to the government\u2019s customary terms, including those governing intellectual property. Due to the complex and often experimental nature of the products and services we offer, we may experience technical difficulties during the development of new products or technologies. These technical difficulties could result in delays and higher costs, which may negatively impact our financial results, and could divert resources from other projects, until such products or technologies are fully developed. See \u201cNote 1 - Significant Accounting Policies\u201d included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details about losses incurred on certain development programs. Additionally, there can be no assurance that our development projects will be successful or meet the needs of our customers.\nOur competitors may also develop new technology, or offerings, or more efficient ways to produce existing products that could cause our existing offerings to become obsolete or that could gain market acceptance before our own competitive offerings. If we fail in our development projects or if our new products or technologies fail to achieve customer acceptance, we may be unsuccessful in procuring new contracts or winning all or a portion of next generation programs, and this could adversely affect our future performance and financial results. We also may not be successful in our efforts to grow in key areas such as hypersonics and mission systems, which could adversely affect our future performance.\nInternational sales may pose different political, economic, regulatory, competition and other risks.\nIn 2020, 25% of our total net sales were from international customers. We have a strategy to continue to grow international sales, inclusive of sales of aircraft to our international partner countries and other countries. International sales are subject to numerous political and economic factors, budget uncertainty, regulatory requirements, significant competition, taxation, and other risks associated with doing business in foreign countries.\nIn international sales, we face substantial competition from both U.S. manufacturers and international manufacturers whose governments sometimes provide research and development assistance, marketing subsidies and other assistance for their products and services. Additionally, many of our competitors are also focusing on increasing their international sales.\nOur international business is conducted through foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. Government to international customers through which the U.S. Government purchases products or services from us on behalf of the foreign customer and by direct commercial sales (DCS) to such customers. In 2020, approximately 67% of our sales to international customers were FMS and about 33% were DCS. FMS contracts with the U.S. Government are subject to the FAR and the DFARS. In contrast, DCS transactions represent sales by us directly to international customers and are not subject to the FAR or the DFARS.\nAll sales to international customers are subject to U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including import-export control, technology transfer restrictions, investments, taxation, repatriation of earnings, exchange controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations, and the anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. Export Control Reform Act of 2018. While we have extensive policies in place to comply with such laws and regulations, failure by us, our employees or others working on our behalf to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil, or criminal liabilities, including suspension, debarment from bidding for or performing government contracts, or suspension of our export privileges, which could have a material adverse effect on us. We frequently team with international subcontractors and suppliers who also are exposed to similar risks.\nInternational sales present risks that are different and potentially greater than those encountered in our U.S. business; and we believe DCS presents the greatest potential risks. DCS transactions involve direct commercial relationships with parties with whom we have less familiarity and where there may be significant cultural differences. Additionally, international procurement and local country rules and regulations, contract laws, and judicial systems differ from those in the U.S. and, in some cases, may be less developed than in the U.S., which could impair our ability to enforce contracts and increase the risk of adverse or\nunpredictable outcomes, including the possibility that certain matters that would be considered civil matters in the U.S. are treated as criminal matters.\nIn conjunction with defense procurements, some international customers require contractors to comply with industrial cooperation regulations, including entering into industrial participation or industrial development agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, as a condition to obtaining orders for our products and services. Industrial development agreements generally extend over several years and obligate the contractor to perform certain commitments, which may include in-country purchases, technology transfers, local manufacturing support, consulting support to in-country projects, investments in joint ventures and financial support projects. Expectations as to offset commitments can be substantial, including high-value content, and may exceed existing local technical capability. Failure to meet these commitments, which can be subjective and outside of our control, may result in significant penalties, and could lead to a reduction in sales to a country. Furthermore, certain of our existing industrial development agreements are dependent upon the successful operation of joint ventures that we do not control and involve products and services that are outside of our core business, which may increase the risk that we fail to meet our industrial cooperation agreements, expose us to compliance risks of the joint venture and impair our ability to recover our investment. For more information on our industrial development obligations, including the notional value of our remaining industrial development obligations and potential penalties for non-compliance, see \u201cContractual Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\u201d in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nPolitical issues and considerations, both in the U.S. and internationally, could have a significant effect on our business.\nOur international business is highly sensitive to changes in regulations (including tariffs, sanctions, embargoes, export and import controls and other trade restrictions), political environments or security risks that may affect our ability to conduct business outside of the U.S., including those regarding investment, procurement, taxation and repatriation of earnings.\nOn July 14, 2020 and again on October 26, 2020, the People\u2019s Republic of China (China) announced it may impose sanctions against Lockheed Martin in response to Congressional Notifications of potential Foreign Military Sales to Taiwan. Foreign Military Sales are government-to-government transactions, and we work closely with the U.S. Government on any military sales to international customers. We will continue to follow official U.S. Government guidance as it relates to sales to Taiwan and do not see a material impact on our sales at this time. China has not specified the nature of any such sanctions, but could seek to restrict our commercial sales or supply chain, including our supply of rare earth or other raw materials, and could also impose sanctions on our suppliers, teammates or partners. The nature, timing and potential impact of any sanctions that may be imposed by China or any other related actions that may be taken are uncertain.\nWe continue to monitor the effect of the United Kingdom\u2019s (UK) departure from the European Union (EU) (commonly referred to as Brexit) on our business operations and financial results. We anticipate that the most probable near-term effects are likely to reflect the pressure Brexit has placed on the UK government, which may influence the government\u2019s ability to make decisions on large complex programs of the type we perform. The post-Brexit border controls between the UK and EU also may have adverse implications on the movement of products or sustainment activities between the UK and EU or may increase costs. Additionally, longer term effects of Brexit may impact the value of the pound sterling. If the pound sterling were to remain depressed against the U.S. dollar, this could negatively impact the ability of the UK government to afford our products and services. While we have operations in the UK and these operations have activity between the UK and the EU (e.g., sales, supply chain, or reliance on personnel), we currently do not anticipate that Brexit will have a material impact on our operations or our financial results. Additionally, our practice is to substantially hedge our transactional currency exposure and therefore, we do not have material currency transaction exposure to the pound sterling or the euro.\nInternational sales also may be adversely affected by actions taken by the U.S. Government in the exercise of foreign policy, Congressional oversight or the financing of particular programs, including the prevention or imposition of conditions upon the sale and delivery of our products, the imposition of sanctions, or Congressional action to block sales of our products. For example, the U.S. Government has imposed certain sanctions on Turkish entities and persons as described in the risk factor below, and could act in the future to prevent or restrict sales to other customers, including the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. U.S. Government officials have indicated that the Biden administration is temporarily pausing the implementation of some pending U.S. defense transfers and sales to various countries to allow incoming leadership an opportunity to review. The officials also state that the review is typical with any new administration, but the duration and results of the review are unknown, and if current sales are delayed or canceled or future sales prohibited or restricted, our results from operations, backlog and future performance could be adversely affected. Our international business also may be impacted by changes in foreign national priorities, foreign government budgets, global economic conditions, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Sales of military products and any associated industrial cooperation agreements are also affected by defense budgets and U.S. foreign policy, including trade restrictions and disputes, and there could be significant delays or other issues in reaching definitive agreements for announced programs and international customer priorities could change.\nAdditionally, the timing of orders from our international customers can be less predictable than for our U.S. customers and may lead to fluctuations in the amount reported each year for our international sales.\nU.S. Government sanctions on Turkey and Turkey\u2019s removal from the program could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nAs a result of Turkey accepting delivery of the Russian S-400 air and missile defense system, the U.S. Government removed Turkey from the program in 2019 and in December 2020 imposed sanctions on Turkey\u2019s defense procurement agency (SSB) and certain of the agency\u2019s officers under the Countering America\u2019s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA). The primary sanction imposed was a restriction on all new U.S. export licenses and authorizations for any goods or technology transferred to the SSB, but does not apply to current, valid export licenses and authorizations. Lockheed Martin expects the U.S. Government to continue to engage Turkey on these issues, but we have no indication that the sanctions will be removed, that additional sanctions will not be imposed or that Turkey will not issue reciprocal sanctions. While we do not expect the current sanctions to have a material effect on our current programs, additional sanctions, reciprocal sanctions or other actions, could be material to our operations, operating results, financial position or cash flows.\nIn addition to having committed to purchase up to 100 aircraft, six of which had completed production at the time of removal, Turkish suppliers continue to produce component parts for the program, some of which are single-sourced. To minimize the risks of disruption of our supply chain and ensure continuity of production, we have been working closely with the DoD and supporting activities to identify and engage alternate suppliers for the component parts produced by Turkish suppliers. We have made significant progress transitioning to non-Turkish suppliers, but due to the procedure to qualify new parts and suppliers, this collaborative process between DoD and Lockheed Martin is ongoing. During 2020, the DoD publicly confirmed that Turkish suppliers would be permitted to provide certain components for the through 2022. While the transition timeline is an important first step, it is equally important that our replacement capacity is re-established so that production is not impacted. Efforts to date have significantly reduced our risk, but final resolution on a limited number of remaining components could affect deliveries, and any accelerated work stoppage would impact cost. We will continue to follow official U.S. Government guidance as it relates to completed Turkish aircraft and the export and import of component parts from the Turkish supply chain.\nThe effects on the program of the U.S. Government sanctions on the SSB and Turkey\u2019s removal from the program do not appear to be significant at this time. However, unforeseen actions could impact the timing of orders, disrupt the production of aircraft, delay delivery of aircraft, disrupt delivery of sustainment components produced in Turkey and impact funding on the program to include the result of any reprogramming of funds that may be necessary to mitigate the impact of alternate sources for component parts made in Turkey. While, in the case of the program, we expect that these costs ultimately would be recovered from the U.S. Government, the availability or timing of any recovery could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.\nWe currently have programs directly with SSB that include delivery and support of helicopters for Turkish end users. We also have contracts with Turkish industry for the Turkish Utility Helicopter Program (TUHP), which is overseen by SSB, in support of Turkish industry\u2019s production of helicopters for Turkish end users. Each program has current, valid export licenses that should not be subject to the current sanctions. We expect pending and future export licensing applications and any required modifications, extensions or changes in scope to the existing licenses, where SSB is a party to the transaction, would be denied, adversely affecting our ability to perform the program contracts. In addition, we have other programs where we work with Turkish industry, including for domestic U.S. Black Hawk helicopter production, that rely on components from Turkish suppliers. While these commercial relationships are not affected by the current sanctions, they could be adversely affected by the imposition of additional sanctions.\nAlthough the current sanctions are not expected to have a material effect on our current programs, they may result in the loss of future sales, and any future sanctions or reciprocal actions by Turkey could result in further restrictions on exports or imports, losses of future sales, reductions in backlog, return of advance payments, costs to develop alternate supply sources, restrictions on payments, force majeure events or contract terminations. Such activity also could result in claims from our suppliers, which may include both the amount established in any settlement agreements, the costs of evaluating supplier settlement proposals and the costs of negotiating settlement agreements. These effects could have a material impact on our operating results, financial position and cash flows.\nWe may be unable to benefit fully from or adequately protect our intellectual property rights or use third-party intellectual property, which could negatively affect our business.\nWe routinely apply for and own a substantial number of U.S. and foreign patents and trademarks related to the products and services we provide. In addition to owning a large portfolio of patents and trademarks, we develop and own other intellectual property, including copyrights, trade secrets and research, development and engineering know-how, which contribute significantly to our business. We also license intellectual property to and from third parties. The FAR and DFARS provide that the U.S. government obtains certain rights in intellectual property, including patents, developed by us and our subcontractors and suppliers in performance of government contracts or with government funding. The U.S. government may use or authorize others, including competitors, to use such intellectual property. Non-U.S. governments may also have certain rights in patents and other intellectual property developed in performance of our contracts with these entities. The U.S. government is pursuing aggressive positions regarding the types of intellectual property to which government use rights apply and when it is appropriate for the government to insist on broad use rights. The DoD is also implementing an overarching intellectual property acquisition policy that will require a greater focus and planning as to intellectual property rights for its programs, and we have no assurance as to the potential impacts of this policy or any associated regulatory changes on future acquisitions. The DoD\u2019s efforts could affect our ability to protect and exploit our intellectual property and to leverage supplier intellectual property, for example, if we are unable to obtain necessary licenses from our suppliers to meet government requirements. Additionally, while we take measures to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights and to respect the intellectual property rights of others, our intellectual property and intellectual property licensed or obtained from third parties is subject to challenges (such as infringement and misappropriation claims) by third parties, which could adversely affect our ability to compete and perform on contracts.\nOur business and financial performance depends, in part, on our ability to identify, attract and retain a highly skilled workforce.\nDue to the specialized nature of our business, our performance is dependent upon our ability to identify, attract and retain a workforce with the requisite skills in multiple areas including: engineering, science, manufacturing, information technology, cybersecurity, business development and strategy and management. Our operating performance is also dependent upon personnel who hold security clearances and receive substantial training in order to work on certain programs or tasks. Additionally, as we expand our operations internationally, it is increasingly important to hire and retain personnel with relevant experience in local laws, regulations, customs, traditions and business practices.\nWe face a number of challenges that may affect personnel retention such as our endeavors to increase the efficiency of our operations and improve the affordability of our products and services such as workforce reductions and consolidating and relocating certain operations. Additionally, a substantial portion of our workforce (including personnel in leadership positions) are retirement-eligible or nearing retirement.\nTo the extent that we lose experienced personnel, it is critical that we develop other employees, hire new qualified personnel, and successfully manage the short and long-term transfer of critical knowledge and skills. Competition for personnel is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining personnel with the requisite skills or clearances. We increasingly compete with commercial technology companies outside of the aerospace and defense industry for qualified technical, cyber and scientific positions as the number of qualified domestic engineers is decreasing and the number of cyber professionals is not keeping up with demand. To the extent that these companies grow at a faster rate or face fewer cost and product pricing constraints, they may be able to offer more attractive compensation and other benefits to candidates or our existing employees. If the demand for skilled personnel exceeds supply, we could experience higher labor, recruiting or training costs in order to attract and retain such employees. We could experience difficulty in performing our contracts and executing on new or growing programs if we have a shortage of skilled employees or if our recruiting is delayed. We also must manage leadership development and succession planning throughout our business. While we have processes in place for management transition and the transfer of knowledge and skills, the loss of key personnel, coupled with an inability to adequately train other personnel, hire new personnel or transfer knowledge and skills, could significantly impact our ability to perform under our contracts and execute on new or growing programs.\nApproximately 20% of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various unions. If we encounter difficulties with renegotiations or renewals of collective bargaining arrangements or are unsuccessful in those efforts, we could incur additional costs and experience work stoppages. Union actions at suppliers can also affect us. Any delays or work stoppages could adversely affect our ability to perform under our contracts, which could negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nOur efforts to minimize the likelihood and impact of adverse cybersecurity incidents and to protect data and intellectual property may not be successful and our business could be negatively affected by cyber or other security threats or other disruptions.\nWe routinely experience various cybersecurity threats, threats to our information technology infrastructure, unauthorized attempts to gain access to our company, employee- and customer-sensitive information, insider threats and denial-of-service attacks as do our customers, suppliers, subcontractors and joint venture partners. We experience similar security threats at customer sites that we operate and manage.\nThe threats we face vary from attacks common to most industries, to more advanced and persistent, highly organized adversaries, including nation states. These nation state actors target us and other defense contractors for several reasons, including because we protect national security information and develop advanced technology systems. If we are unable to protect sensitive information, including complying with evolving information security and data protection/privacy regulations, our customers or governmental authorities could question the adequacy of our threat mitigation and detection processes and procedures. Moreover, depending on the severity of an incident, our customers\u2019 data, our employees\u2019 data, our intellectual property (including trade secrets and research, development and engineering know-how), and other third-party data (such as teammates, joint venture partners, subcontractors, suppliers and vendors) could be compromised. Products and services we provide to customers also carry cybersecurity risks, including risks that they could be breached or fail to detect, prevent or combat attacks, which could result in losses to our customers and claims against us, and could harm our relationships with our customers.\nWe take a variety of precautions to protect our systems and data, including a Computer Incident Response Team (CIRT) to defend against cyber attacks and regular periodic training of our employees on protection of sensitive information, including training intended to prevent the success of \u201cphishing\u201d attacks. However, as a consequence of the persistence, sophistication and volume of cyber attacks, we may not be successful in defending against all such attacks. We also have a corporate-wide counterintelligence and insider threat detection program to proactively identify external and internal threats, and mitigate those threats in a timely manner. Nevertheless, due to the evolving nature of these security threats and the national security aspects of much of the data we protect, the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted.\nIn addition to cyber threats, we experience threats to the security of our facilities and employees and threats from terrorist acts. We also typically work cooperatively with our customers, suppliers, subcontractors, joint venture partners and entities we acquire, whom are subject to similar threats, to seek to minimize the impact of cyber threats, other security threats or business disruptions. However, we must rely on the safeguards put in place by these entities, and other entities, none of which we control, who have access to our information, and thus may affect the security of our information or the information we are obligated to protect. These entities have varying levels of cybersecurity expertise and safeguards, and their relationships with government contractors, including us, may increase the likelihood that they are targeted by the same cyber threats we face. We have thousands of direct suppliers and even more indirect suppliers with a wide variety of systems and cybersecurity capabilities and adversaries actively seek to exploit security and cybersecurity weaknesses in our supply chain. A breach in our multi-tiered supply chain could impact our data or customer deliverables. We also must rely on this supply chain for detecting and reporting cyber incidents, which could affect our ability to report or respond to cybersecurity incidents effectively or in a timely manner.\nThe costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means. Additionally, some cyber technologies we develop under contract for our customers, particularly those related to homeland security, may raise potential liabilities related to intellectual property and civil liberties, including privacy concerns, which may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means or involve reputational risk. Our enterprise risk management program includes threat detection and cybersecurity mitigation plans, and our disclosure controls and procedures address cybersecurity and include elements intended to ensure that there is an analysis of potential disclosure obligations arising from security breaches. We also maintain compliance programs to address the potential applicability of restrictions on trading while in possession of material, nonpublic information generally and in connection with a cybersecurity breach.\nIf we fail to manage acquisitions, divestitures, equity investments and other transactions, including our proposed acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne, successfully or if acquired entities or equity investments fail to perform as expected, our financial results, business and future prospects could be harmed.\nIn pursuing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate companies, and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions, joint ventures, other investments and divestitures. We seek to identify acquisition or investment opportunities that will expand or complement our existing products and services or customer base, at attractive valuations. We often compete with other companies for the same opportunities. To be successful, we must conduct due diligence to identify valuation issues and potential loss contingencies; negotiate transaction terms; complete and close complex transactions;\nintegrate acquired companies and employees; and realize anticipated operating synergies efficiently and effectively. Acquisition, divestiture, joint venture and investment transactions often require substantial management resources and have the potential to divert our attention from our existing business. Unidentified or identified but un-indemnified pre-closing liabilities could affect our future financial results, particularly through successor liability under procurement laws and regulations such as the False Claims Act or Truth in Negotiations Act, anti-corruption, environmental, tax, import-export and technology transfer laws, which provide for civil and criminal penalties and the potential for debarment. We also may incur unanticipated costs or expenses, including post-closing asset impairment charges, expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities, employee retention, transaction-related or other litigation, and other liabilities. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOn December 20, 2020, we entered into an agreement to acquire Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc. (Aerojet Rocketdyne). The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2021 and is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and approval by Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s stockholders. We may be unable to achieve the expected benefits of this transaction as a result of, among other things, the failure to obtain, delays in obtaining, or adverse conditions contained in any required regulatory or other approvals for consummation of the acquisition; the possibility that Aerojet Rocketdyne stockholders may not approve the proposed acquisition; the failure to consummate or a delay in consummating the proposed acquisition for other reasons; the failure by us to obtain any necessary financing on favorable terms or at all; Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s or our business being disrupted due to transaction-related uncertainty; the failure to successfully and timely integrate Aerojet Rocketdyne and realize the expected synergies, cost savings and other benefits of the acquisition; the risk of litigation relating to the proposed acquisition; competitive responses to the proposed acquisition; unexpected liabilities, costs, charges or expenses resulting from the acquisition; and potential adverse reactions or changes to business relationships from the announcement or completion of the acquisition. The expected cash cost of the acquisition of approximately $4.4 billion also assumes the assumption of net cash on the balance sheet of Aerojet Rocketdyne at closing after payment of outstanding debt, which is subject to uncertainty related to Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s earnings and costs through the date of closing. The total equity value of approximately $4.6 billion to be paid by Lockheed Martin for Aerojet Rocketdyne, including Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s convertible notes on an as-converted basis, assumes the payment by Aerojet Rocketdyne of its announced special cash dividend, which is revocable through the payment date at the election of the Aerojet Rocketdyne board of directors.\nJoint ventures and other noncontrolling investments operate under shared control with other parties. These investments typically face many of the same risks and uncertainties as we do, but in addition may expose us to additional risks not present if we retained full control. A joint venture partner may have economic or other business interests that are inconsistent with ours and we may be unable to prevent strategic decisions that may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We also could be adversely affected by, or liable for, actions taken by these joint ventures that we do not control, including violations of anti-corruption, import and export, taxation and anti-boycott laws.\nDepending on our rights and percentage of ownership, we may consolidate the financial results of such entities or account for our interests under the equity method. Under the equity method of accounting for nonconsolidated ventures and investments, we recognize our share of the operating profit or loss of these joint ventures in our results of operations. Our operating results are affected by the conduct and performance of businesses over which we do not exercise control and, as a result, we may not be successful in achieving the growth or other intended benefits of strategic investments. Of our business segments, our equity investments had the greatest impact on our Space business segment where approximately 12% of its 2020 operating profit was derived from its share of earnings from equity method investees, primarily that in United Launch Alliance (ULA). We also have our 51% ownership interest in AWE Management Limited (AWE), which operates the United Kingdom\u2019s nuclear deterrent program. This venture generated sales of about $1.4 billion and net earnings of about $29 million in 2020. On November 2, 2020, the UK Ministry of Defense announced its intention to re-nationalize the program on June 30, 2021, which is expected to result in the loss of future sales and operating profit attributable to AWE.\nThrough our Lockheed Martin Ventures Fund, we make investments in companies (both within the U.S. and in other countries) that we believe are developing disruptive technologies applicable to our core businesses and new initiatives important to Lockheed Martin. These investments may be in the forms of common or preferred stock, convertible debt securities or investments in funds. Typically, we hold a non-controlling interest and, therefore, are unable to influence strategic decisions by these companies and may have limited visibility into their activities, which may result in our not realizing the intended benefits of the investments. We have also begun investing in funds that invest in other companies. We have less influence and visibility as a non-controlling investor in a fund.\nRisks Related to Significant Contingencies, Uncertainties and Estimates, including Pension, Environmental and Litigation Costs\nPension funding and costs are dependent on several economic assumptions which if changed may cause our future earnings and cash flow to fluctuate significantly as well as affect the affordability of our products and services.\nMany of our employees and retirees participate in defined benefit pension plans, retiree medical and life insurance plans, and other postemployment plans (collectively, postretirement benefit plans). The impact of these plans on our earnings may be volatile in that the amount of expense we record for our postretirement benefit plans may materially change from year to year because the calculations are sensitive to changes in several key economic assumptions including interest rates and rates of return on plan assets, other actuarial assumptions including participant longevity (also known as mortality) and employee turnover, as well as the timing of cash funding. Changes in these factors, including actual returns on plan assets, may also affect our plan funding, cash flow and stockholders\u2019 equity. In addition, the funding of our plans and recovery of costs on our contracts, as described below, may also be subject to changes caused by legislative or regulatory actions.\nWith regard to cash flow, we make substantial cash contributions to our plans as required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA). We generally are able to recover these contributions related to our plans as allowable costs on our U.S. Government contracts, including FMS. However, there is a lag between the time when we contribute cash to our plans under pension funding rules and when we recover pension costs under U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS). We also may not be successful in our efforts to reduce the volatility of our outstanding pension obligations and to accelerate CAS recovery and recover associated costs from the U.S. Government.\nFor more information on how these factors could impact earnings, financial position, cash flow and stockholders\u2019 equity, see \u201cCritical Accounting Policies - Postretirement Benefit Plans\u201d in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and \u201cNote 12 - Postretirement Benefit Plans\u201d included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur estimates and projections may prove to be inaccurate and certain of our assets may be at risk of future impairment.\nThe accounting for some of our most significant activities is based on judgments and estimates, which are complex and subject to many variables. For example, accounting for sales using the percentage-of-completion method requires that we assess risks and make assumptions regarding schedule, cost, technical and performance issues for thousands of contracts, many of which are long-term in nature. Additionally, we initially allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses based on a preliminary assessment of the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. For significant acquisitions we may use a one-year measurement period to analyze and assess a number of factors used in establishing the asset and liability fair values as of the acquisition date which could result in adjustments to asset and liability balances.\nWe have $10.8 billion of goodwill assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 from previous acquisitions, which represents approximately 21% of our total assets. These goodwill assets are subject to annual impairment testing and more frequent testing upon the occurrence of certain events or significant changes in circumstances that indicate goodwill may be impaired. If we experience changes or factors arise that negatively affect the expected cash flows of a reporting unit, we may be required to write off all or a portion of the reporting unit\u2019s related goodwill assets. The carrying value and fair value of our Sikorsky reporting unit are closely aligned. Therefore, any business deterioration, contract cancellations or terminations, or market pressures could cause our sales, earnings and cash flows to decline below current projections and could cause goodwill and intangible assets to be impaired. Additionally, Sikorsky may not perform as expected, or demand for its products may be adversely affected by global economic conditions, including oil and gas trends that are outside of our control.\nChanges in U.S. (federal or state) or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including those with retroactive effect, including the amortization for research or experimental expenditures, could result in increases in our tax expense and affect profitability and cash flows. Beginning in 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminates the option to deduct research and development expenditures currently and requires taxpayers to amortize them over five years. While it is possible that Congress may modify or repeal this provision before it takes effect and we continue to have ongoing discussions with members of Congress, both on our own and with other industries through coalitions, we have no assurance that these provisions will be modified or repealed. Furthermore, we are continuing to work with our advisors to refine our legal interpretation of this provision prior to implementation in 2022. If these provisions are not repealed and based on current interpretations of the law, initially this would materially decrease our cash from operations based on current assumptions beginning in 2022 by approximately $2.0 billion; and increase our net deferred tax assets by a similar amount. The largest impact would be on 2022 cash from operations, which would depend on the amount of research and development expenses paid or incurred in 2022 and other factors. The impact, however, would continue over the five year amortization period but would\ndecrease over the period and be immaterial in year six. The amount of net deferred tax assets will change periodically based on several factors, including the measurement of our postretirement benefit plan obligations, actual cash contributions to our postretirement benefit plans, and future changes in tax laws. In addition, we are regularly under audit or examination by tax authorities, including foreign tax authorities. The final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could similarly result in unanticipated increases in our tax expense and affect profitability and cash flows.\nOur business involves significant risks and uncertainties that may not be covered by indemnity or insurance.\nA significant portion of our business relates to designing, developing and manufacturing advanced defense and technology products and systems. New technologies may be untested or unproven. Failure of some of these products and services could result in extensive loss of life or property damage. Accordingly, we may incur liabilities that are unique to our products and services. In some but not all circumstances, we may be entitled to certain legal protections or indemnifications from our customers, either through U.S. Government indemnifications under Public Law 85-804 or the Price-Anderson Act, qualification of our products and services by the Department of Homeland Security under the SAFETY Act provisions of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, contractual provisions or otherwise. We endeavor to obtain insurance coverage from established insurance carriers to cover these risks and liabilities. The amount of insurance coverage that we maintain may not be adequate to cover all claims or liabilities. Existing coverage may be canceled while we remain exposed to the risk and it is not possible to obtain insurance to protect against all operational risks, natural hazards and liabilities. For example, we are limited in the amount of insurance we can obtain to cover certain natural hazards such as earthquakes, fires or extreme weather conditions. We have significant operations in geographic areas prone to these risks, such as in California, Florida and Texas. Even if insurance coverage is available, we may not be able to obtain it in an amount, at a price or on terms acceptable to us. Some insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to provide us insurance given the nature of our business or products. Additionally, disputes with insurance carriers over coverage terms or the insolvency of one or more of our insurance carriers may significantly affect the amount or timing of our cash flows.\nSubstantial costs resulting from an accident; failure of or defect in our products or services; natural catastrophe or other incident; or liability arising from our products and services in excess of any legal protection, indemnity, and our insurance coverage (or for which indemnity or insurance is not available or not obtained) could adversely impact our financial condition, cash flows, and operating results. Any accident, failure of, or defect in our products or services, even if fully indemnified or insured, could negatively affect our reputation among our customers and the public and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively. It also could affect the cost and availability of adequate insurance in the future.\nEnvironmental costs could adversely affect our future earnings as well as the affordability of our products and services.\nOur operations are subject to and affected by a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental protection laws and regulations. We are involved in environmental remediation at some of our current and former facilities and at third-party-owned sites where we have been designated a potentially responsible party as a result of our prior activities and those of our predecessor companies. In addition, we could be affected by future regulations imposed or claims asserted in response to concerns over climate change, other aspects of the environment or natural resources. We have an ongoing, comprehensive sustainability program to reduce the effects of our operations on the environment.\nWe manage and have managed various U.S. Government-owned facilities on behalf of the U.S. Government. At such facilities, environmental compliance and remediation costs historically have been the responsibility of the U.S. Government. We have relied, and continue to rely with respect to past practices, on U.S. Government funding to pay such costs, notwithstanding efforts by some U.S. Government representatives to limit this responsibility. Although the U.S. Government remains responsible for capital and operating costs associated with environmental compliance, responsibility for fines and penalties associated with environmental noncompliance typically is borne by either the U.S. Government or the contractor, depending on the contract and the relevant facts. Some environmental laws include criminal provisions. A conviction under environmental law could affect our ability to be awarded future or perform under existing U.S. Government contracts.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur liabilities under various federal, state, local and foreign statutes for environmental protection and remediation. The extent of our financial exposure cannot in all cases be reasonably estimated at this time. Among the variables management must assess in evaluating costs associated with these cases and remediation sites generally are the status of site assessment, extent of the contamination, impacts on natural resources, changing cost estimates, evolution of technologies used to remediate the site, continually evolving environmental standards and cost allowability issues, including varying efforts by the U.S. Government to limit allowability of our costs in resolving liability at third-party-owned sites. For information regarding these matters, including current estimates of the amounts that we believe are required for environmental remediation to the extent probable and estimable, see \u201cCritical Accounting Policies - Environmental Matters\u201d in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and \u201cNote 15 - Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies\u201d included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe are involved in a number of legal proceedings. We cannot predict the outcome of litigation and other contingencies with certainty.\nOur business may be adversely affected by the outcome of legal proceedings and other contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty. As required by U.S. GAAP, we estimate loss contingencies and establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable in light of the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time. Subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a liability or as a reserve against assets in our financial statements. For a description of our current legal proceedings, see Item 3 - Legal Proceedings along with \u201cNote 15 - Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies\u201d included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to increase our dividend or to repurchase shares of our common stock at current levels.\nCash dividend payments and share repurchases are subject to limitations under applicable laws and the discretion of our Board of Directors and are determined after considering then-existing conditions, including earnings, other operating results and capital requirements and cash deployment alternatives. Our payment of dividends and share repurchases could vary from historical practices or our stated expectations. Decreases in asset values or increases in liabilities, including liabilities associated with benefit plans and assets and liabilities associated with taxes, can reduce net earnings and stockholders\u2019 equity. A deficit in stockholders\u2019 equity could limit our ability to pay dividends and make share repurchases under Maryland state law in the future. In addition, the timing and amount of share repurchases under board approved share repurchase plans is within the discretion of management and will depend on many factors, including results of operations, capital requirements and applicable law.\nActual financial results could differ from our judgments and estimates. See \u201cCritical Accounting Policies\u201d in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and \u201cNote 1 - Significant Accounting Policies\u201d included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies and use of estimates.", "PERMNO": 21178, "SIC": 3760, "TIC": "LMT"}
