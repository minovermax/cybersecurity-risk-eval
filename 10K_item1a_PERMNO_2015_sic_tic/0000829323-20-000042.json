{"cik": "829323", "company": "Inuvo, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-05-12", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nAn investment in our common stock involves a significant degree of risk. Many of the risk factors are, and will continue to be, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and any worsening of the economic environment. You should not invest in our common stock unless you can afford to lose your entire investment. You should consider carefully the following risk factors and other information in this report before deciding to invest in our common stock. If any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected and you could lose your entire investment in our company.\nWe have a history of losses, and our revenues declined in 2019 from 2018. We cannot anticipate with any degree of certainty what our revenues will be in future periods. While our gross profit margin increased from 59.2% in 2018 to 63.1% in 2019, our revenues declined approximately 16% in 2019 as compared to 2018. We reported an operating loss of approximately $7.7 million in 2019 as compared to an operating loss of approximately $5.5 million in 2018. The lower revenue in 2019 as compared to 2018 was due primarily to the ValidClick operations where monetization from advertising inventory sold to our largest demand partners was lower in 2019 in part due to a focus shift associated with the Mergers (as described below) which were terminated in June 2019. In addition, the previously announced strategy to reduce focus on the non-strategic publisher side technologies resulted in lower revenue in 2019 this year compared to 2018. The higher gross margin in 2019 is primarily due to the change of revenue mix within the ValidClick business. As described elsewhere in this report, our industry is currently in a consolidation phase and our strategic decisions in 2018 to discontinue certain non-strategic technologies in response to our changing industry involved the short-term loss of revenue and margin in anticipation of future growth and margins starting in 2019. Since our credit facility is dependent upon receivables, and we do not know when, if ever, that our revenues will return to historic levels or if we will be able to replace those lost revenues with revenues from other sources, the combination of lower credit availability and recent negative cash flows generated from operating activities introduces potential risk of operation without interruption.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus disease (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) was first reported in Wuhan, China. Less than four months later, on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic-the first pandemic caused by a coronavirus. The outbreak has reached more than 160 countries, resulting in the implementation of significant governmental measures, including lockdowns, closures, quarantines and travel bans, intended to control the spread of the virus. The COVID-19 outbreak has already caused severe global disruptions. Beginning in late April 2020, we experienced a significant reduction in demand (marketing budgets) within the ValidClick business and a modest decline in demand within the IntentKey business, the combination of which has resulted in a significant reduction in our revenue run rate, the combination of which has resulted in a significant reduction in our revenue run rate. Generally, marketing budgets tend to decline in times of a recession. We have started to curtail expenses, including compensation and travel and we have issued a work from home policy to protect our employees and their families from virus transmission associated with co-workers. We are beginning to experience interruptions in our daily operations, including our 10-K reporting process, as a result of these policies. We expect the revenue impact on our industry could vary dramatically by vertical. For example, we would expect to see less advertising demand from the travel, leisure and hospitality verticals. We also maintain long-standing relationships with Yahoo!, Google and Microsoft Online that provide access to hundreds of thousands of advertisers from which most of our ValidClick and digital publishing revenue originates. Any adverse impact on the operations of those companies would have a correspondingly adverse impact on our revenues in future periods. We will continue to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our company, however, at this time we are unable to predict all possible impacts on our company, operations and revenues. Should revenues continue to turn downwards or fail to return to historical levels, we may not be able to offset expenses quickly enough which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and adversely impact the trading price of our common stock.\nOur auditors have raised substantial doubts as to our ability to continue as a going concern. Our consolidated financial statements appearing later in this report have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern. We have sustained recurring losses from operations and have a net capital deficiency. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nOur working capital deficit has increased substantially at December 31, 2019 as compared to December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2019, we had a cash balance of approximately $373,000 and a working capital deficit of approximately $7.5 million as compared to a cash balance of approximately $229,000 and a working capital deficit of approximately $6.9 million at December 31, 2018. We used approximately $5.3 million in net cash in our operations in 2019 as compared to approximately $2.1 million of net cash used in operations in 2018. Our principal sources of liquidity are our borrowings under our credit facility, which was represented in 2019 by, the Amended and Restated Financing Agreement with Western Alliance Bank which is described in Note 6 to our 2019 audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report, the sale of our common stock and borrowings from non-bank lenders. In March 2020 and April 2020, we raised approximately $1.5 million from the sale of our securities to provide additional working capital for our company. In addition, in April 2020 we\nobtained an unsecured $1.1 million loan through Relyance Bank N.A. under the Paycheck Protection Program (the \u201cPPP Loan\u201d) pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d). In accordance with the requirements of the CARES Act, we are using the proceeds from the PPP Loan primarily for payroll costs. Though we believe current operating cash flows, the additional working capital, the PPP Loan and the credit facility will be sufficient to sustain operations for the next six months, if our plan to grow the IntentKey business is unsuccessful, we may need to fund operations through private or public sales of securities, debt financings or partnering/licensing transactions. There is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining funding to continue operations, particularly in light of the current impact of the coronavirus on the U.S. capital markets.\nWe rely on two customers for a significant portion of our revenues. We are reliant upon Yahoo! and Google for most of our revenue. During 2019 they accounted for 64.4%, and 14.1% of our revenues, respectively. In 2018, Yahoo! and Google accounted for 71.7% and 10.0% of our revenues, respectively. The amount of revenue we receive from these customers is dependent on a number of factors outside of our control, including the amount they charge for advertisements, the depth of advertisements available from them, and their ability to display relevant ads in response to end-user queries. We would likely experience a significant decline in revenue and our business operations could be significantly harmed if these customers do not approve our new websites and applications, or if we violate their guidelines or they change their guidelines. In addition, if any of these preceding circumstances were to occur, we may not be able to find a suitable alternate paid search results provider or otherwise replace the lost revenues. The loss of any of these customers or a material change in the revenue or gross profit they generate would have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition in future periods.\nAbility to maintain our credit facility could impact our ability to access capital as needed. We historically maintained a credit facility with Western Alliance Bank, the parent company of Bridge Bank, N.A. On March 12, 2020 we closed a Loan and Security Agreement with Hitachi Capital America Corp. (\"Hitachi\") the terms of which are described later in this report which replaced our credit facility with Western Alliance Bank. Under the terms of the Loan and Security Agreement, Hitachi has provided us with a $5,000,000 line of credit commitment which permits us to borrow against eligible accounts receivable and unbilled receivables. The Hitachi Loan and Security Agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants to which we are subject. There are no assurances that we will be able to comply with all the covenants. In the event we violate a covenant, Hitachi may limit or demand all amounts due under the credit facility at any time, including upon an event of default outstanding, if any, to be due and payable. If this occurs and we have outstanding obligations and are not able to repay, Hitachi could require us to apply all of our available cash to repay the debt amounts and could then proceed against the underlying collateral. Should this occur, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay our debt in full, we would be able to borrow sufficient funds to refinance the debt. In such an event, our ability to conduct our business as it is currently conducted would be in jeopardy.\nWe are dependent upon relationships with and the success of our supply partners. Our supply partners are very important to our success. We must recruit and maintain partners who are able to drive traffic successfully to their websites and mobile applications, resulting in clicks on advertisements we have delivered. These partners may experience difficulty in attracting and maintaining users for a number of reasons, including competition, rapidly changing markets and technology, industry consolidation and changing consumer preferences. We have experienced a decrease in the number of supply partners and quantity of Internet traffic from supply partners within ValidClick beginning in late April 2020. Additionally, we are experiencing turnover in our supply partner network and there can be no assurance traffic levels will increase to prior levels or that we will be able to replace supply partners that have left our network. Further, we may not be able to further develop and maintain relationships with distribution partners. They may be able to make their own deals directly with advertisers, may view us as competitors or may find our competitors offerings more desirable. Any of these potential events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nThe success of our owned sites is dependent on our ability to acquire traffic in a profitable manner. Our ALOT-branded websites are dependent on our ability to attract traffic in a profitable manner. We use a predictive model to calculate the rate of return for marketing campaigns, which includes estimates and assumptions. If these estimates and assumptions are not accurate, we may not be able to effectively manage our marketing decisions and could acquire traffic in an unprofitable manner. In addition, we may not be able to maintain and grow our traffic for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to, acceptance of our websites by consumers, the availability of advertising to promote our websites, competition, and sufficiency of capital to purchase advertising. We advertise on search engine websites to drive traffic to our owned and operated websites. Our keyword advertising is done primarily with Google and Facebook, but also with Yahoo! and Bing. If we are unable to maintain and grow traffic to our sites in a profitable manner, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business must keep pace with rapid technological change to remain competitive. Our business operates in a market characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, frequent new product and service announcements, enhancements, and changing customer demands. We must adapt to rapidly changing technologies and industry standards and continually improve the speed, performance, features, ease of use and reliability of our services. This includes making our products and services compatible and maintaining compatibility with multiple operating systems, desktop and mobile devices, and evolving network infrastructure. If we fail to do this, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected.\nOur services may be interrupted if we experience problems with our network infrastructure. The performance of our network infrastructure is critical to our business and reputation. Because our services are delivered solely through the Internet, our network infrastructure could be disrupted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022unexpected increases in usage of our services;\n\u2022computer viruses and other security issues;\n\u2022interruption or other loss of connectivity provided by third-party Internet service providers;\n\u2022natural disasters or other catastrophic events; and\n\u2022server failures or other hardware problems.\nWhile we have data centers in multiple, geographically dispersed locations and active back-up and disaster recovery plans, we cannot assure you that serious interruptions will not occur in the future. If our services were to be interrupted, it could cause loss of users, customers and business partners, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nRegulatory and legal uncertainties could harm our business. While there are currently relatively few laws or regulations directly applicable to Internet-based commerce or commercial search activity, there is increasing awareness of such activity and interest from state and federal lawmakers in regulating these services. New regulation of activities in which we are involved or the extension of existing laws and regulations to Internet-based services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.\nFailure to comply with federal, state and international privacy and data security laws and regulations, or the expansion of current or the enactment of new privacy and data security laws or regulations, could adversely affect our business. A variety of federal, state and international laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of consumer data. In addition, various federal, state and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies may expand current or enact new laws regarding privacy matters. For example, recently there have been Congressional hearings and increased attention to the capture and use of location-based information relating to users of smartphones and other mobile devices, and internationally the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) went into effect in May 2018. We have posted privacy policies and practices concerning the collection, use and disclosure of subscriber data on our websites and applications. The existing and soon to be enacted privacy and data security related laws and regulations are evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations. Several Internet companies have incurred penalties for failing to abide by the representations made in their privacy policies and practices. In addition, several states have adopted legislation that requires businesses to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices to protect sensitive personal information and to provide notice to consumers in the event of a security breach. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any data-related consent orders, Federal Trade Commission requirements or orders or other federal, state or international privacy or consumer protection-related laws, including the GDPR, regulations or industry self-regulatory principles could result in claims, proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others or other liabilities, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe may face third party intellectual property infringement claims that could be costly to defend and result in the loss of significant rights. From time to time third parties have asserted infringement claims against us including copyright, trademark and patent infringement, among other things. While we believe that we have defenses to these types of claims under appropriate\ntrademark laws, we may not prevail in our defenses to any intellectual property infringement claims. In addition, we may not be adequately insured for any judgments awarded in connection with any litigation. Any such claims and resulting litigation could subject us to significant liability for damages or result in the invalidation of our proprietary rights, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Even if we were to prevail, these claims could be time-consuming, expensive to defend, and could result in the diversion of management's time and attention.\nWe are subject to risks from publishers who could fabricate clicks either manually or technologically. Our business involves the establishment of relationships with website owners and publishers. In exchange for their consumer traffic, we provide an advertising placement service and share a portion of the revenue we collect with that website publisher. Although we have click fraud detection software in place, we cannot guarantee that we will identify all fraudulent clicks or be able to recover funds distributed for fabricated clicks. This risk could materially impact our ability to borrow, our cash flow and the stability of our business.\nOur business is seasonal and our financial results may vary significantly from period to period. Our future results of operations may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year because of numerous factors, including seasonality. Historically, in the later part of the fourth quarter and the earlier part of the first quarter we experience lower Revenue Per Click (\u201cRPC\u201d) due to a decline in demand for inventory on website and app space and the recalibrating of advertiser\u2019s marketing budgets after the holiday selling season. If we are not able to appropriately adjust to seasonal or other factors, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nFailure to comply with the covenants and restrictions in our grant agreement with the State of Arkansas could result in the repayment of a portion of the grant, which we may not be able to repay or finance on favorable terms. In January 2013, we entered into an agreement with the State of Arkansas whereby we were granted $1,750,000 for the relocation of the Company to Arkansas and for the purchase of equipment. The grant was contingent upon us having at least 50 full-time equivalent permanent positions within four years, maintaining at least 50 full-time equivalent permanent positions for the following six years and paying those positions an average total compensation of $90,000 per year. As of December 31, 2019, we had 33 full-time employees located in Arkansas. Failure to meet the requirements of the grant after the initial four-year period, may require us to repay a portion of the grant, up to but not to exceed the full amount of the grant. At December 31, 2019, we accrued a contingent liability of $85,000 for the lower than required employment. Should the lower than required employment continue, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay our grant in full, we would be able to borrow sufficient funds to refinance the grant, or that we would be able to obtain a waiver to cure any such default. In such an event, our ability to conduct our business as it is currently conducted would be in jeopardy.\nWe are subject to the continued listing standards of the NYSE American and our failure to satisfy these criteria may result in delisting of our common stock. Our common stock is listed on the NYSE American. In order to maintain this listing, we must maintain a certain share price, financial and share distribution targets, including maintaining a minimum amount of shareholders\u2019 equity and a minimum number of public shareholders. In addition to these objective standards, the NYSE American may delist the securities of any issuer (i) if, in its opinion, the issuer\u2019s financial condition and/or operating results appear unsatisfactory; (ii) if it appears that the extent of public distribution or the aggregate market value of the security has become so reduced as to make continued listing on the NYSE American inadvisable; (iii) if the issuer sells or disposes of principal operating assets or ceases to be an operating company; (iv) if an issuer fails to comply with the NYSE American\u2019s listing requirements; (v) if an issuer\u2019s securities sell at what the NYSE American considers a \u201clow selling price\u201d which the exchange generally considers $0.20 per share and the issuer fails to correct this via a reverse split of shares after notification by the NYSE American; or (vi) if any other event occurs or any condition exists which makes continued listing on the NYSE American, in its opinion, inadvisable. There are no assurances how the market price of our common stock will be impacted in future periods as a result of the general uncertainties in the capital markets and any specific impact on our company as a result of the coronavirus. If the NYSE American delists our common stock, investors may face material adverse consequences, including, but not limited to, a lack of trading market for our common stock, reduced liquidity, decreased analyst coverage of our common stock, and an inability for us to obtain any additional financing to fund our operations that we may need.\nOur quarterly operating results can be difficult to predict and can fluctuate substantially, which could result in volatility in the price of our common stock. Our quarterly revenues and other operating results have varied in the past and are likely to continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter. Our agreements with distribution partners and key customers do not require minimum levels of usage or payments, and our revenues therefore fluctuate based on the actual usage of our service each quarter by existing and new distribution partners. In addition to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our revenues, quarterly fluctuations in our operating results also might be due to numerous other factors, including:\n\u2022our ability to attract new distribution partners, including the length of our sales cycles, or to sell increased usage of our service to existing distribution partners;\n\u2022technical difficulties or interruptions in our services;\n\u2022changes in privacy protection and other governmental regulations applicable to our industry;\n\u2022changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors;\n\u2022the financial condition and business success of our distribution partners;\n\u2022purchasing and budgeting cycles of our distribution partners;\n\u2022acquisitions of businesses and products by us or our competitors;\n\u2022competition, including entry into the market by new competitors or new offerings by existing competitors;\n\u2022discounts offered to advertisers by upstream advertising networks;\n\u2022our history of litigation;\n\u2022our ability to hire, train and retain sufficient sales, client management and other personnel;\n\u2022timing of development, introduction and market acceptance of new services or service enhancements by us or our competitors;\n\u2022concentration of marketing expenses for activities such as trade shows and advertising campaigns;\n\u2022expenses related to any new or expanded data centers; and\n\u2022general economic and financial market conditions.\nSignificant dilution will occur if outstanding convertible securities options are exercised or restricted stock unit grants vest. As of December 31, 2019, we had stock options outstanding to purchase a total of 18,248 shares with exercise prices ranging from $0.56 to $3.70 per share, with a weighted average exercise price of $1.74, 2,568,951 outstanding restricted stock units and a convertible promissory note which is convertible into an aggregate of 657,143 shares of our common stock, subject to adjustment under the terms of the notes. We also had 2,568,951 restricted stock units outstanding. If outstanding stock options are exercised, the note is converted or the restricted stock units vest, dilution will occur to our stockholders, which may be significant.", "PERMNO": 90608, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "INUV"}
