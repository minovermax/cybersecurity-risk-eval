{"cik": "715446", "company": "ITUS Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-12-07", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors. Our business involves a high degree of risk and uncertainty, including the following risks and uncertainties:\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition and Operations\nWe have a history of losses and may incur additional losses in the future.\nOn a cumulative basis we have sustained substantial losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception. As of October 31, 2016, our accumulated deficit was approximately $151,165,000. As of October 31, 2016, we had approximately $3,238,000 in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, and working capital of approximately $2,932,000. We incurred losses of approximately $5,016,000 in fiscal year 2016. We expect to incur material research and development expenses and to continue incurring significant legal and general and administrative expenses in connection with our operations. As a result, we anticipate that we will incur losses in the future.\nAs a result of our current lack of financial liquidity, our independent registered public accounting firm (\u201cauditors\u201d) has expressed substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a \u201cgoing concern.\u201d\nAs a result of our limited working capital, historical losses and our current burn rate, our auditors\u2019 report for our financial statements for the year ended October 31, 2016, which is included as part of this Annual Report, contains a statement expressing substantial doubt concerning our ability to continue as a \u201cgoing concern\u201d. Potential sources of capital include income from operations, debt, and the sale of the company\u2019s equity securities. Many factors impact our ability to generate capital including the results of our ongoing clinical trials, the price of our stock, the liquidity of our stock, factors that influence the capital markets, and the overall health of the U.S. and world economies.\nBecause Cchek\u00d4 is at early stages of development, it is not likely that we will generate revenue from operations for the foreseeable future. In the event that we are unable to raise additional capital, the ongoing development of Cchek\u00d4 would be materially and adversely impacted as would the continuing viability of the Company.\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. In order for us to have sufficient capital to execute our business plan, fund our operations and meet our debt obligations over the next 12 months, we will need to raise additional capital. Although we have been successful in the past in raising capital, we cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in doing so in the future to the extent necessary to be able to fund our operating activities and debt obligations over the next 12 months, which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nWe will need additional funding in the future which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and, if available, may result in dilution to our stockholders.\nBased on currently available information as of December 7, 2016, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and expected cash flows from operations will not be sufficient to fund our activities and debt obligations for the next 12 months. To date, we have relied primarily upon cash from the public and private sale of equity and debt securities, as well as net proceeds from the December 2014 AUO settlement, to generate the working capital needed to finance our operations. If current cash on hand, cash equivalents, short term investments and cash that may be generated from our business operations are insufficient to continue to operate our business, we will be required to obtain more working capital. We may seek to obtain working capital through sales of our equity securities or through bank credit facilities or public or private debt from various financial institutions where possible which would be junior to our existing Redemtion Debenture (as defined below). We cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If we do identify sources for additional funding, the sale of additional equity securities or convertible debt could result in dilution to our stockholders. Additionally, the sale of equity securities or issuance of debt securities may be subject to certain security holder approvals or may result in the downward adjustment of the exercise or conversion price of our outstanding securities. We can give no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flows in the future to satisfy our liquidity requirements or sustain future operations, or that other sources of funding, such as sales of equity or debt, would be available or would be approved by our security holders, if needed, on favorable terms or at all. If we fail to obtain additional working capital as and when needed, such failure could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, such lack of funds may inhibit our ability to respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated capital needs, or may force us to reduce operating expenses, which would significantly harm the business and development of operations.\nFailure to pay our secured debt holder may result in a foreclosure.\nOn September 9, 2014, we issued 140 shares of Series A Preferred Stock having an aggregate value of $3,500,000 (the \"Series A Preferred\") and a warrant to purchase 370,000 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock (the \u201cSeptember 2014 Warrant\u201d). The September 2014 Warrant expired on November 11, 2016. Holders of our Series A Preferred had a one-time right to require the Company to redeem the Series A Preferred shares, which right was set to expire on November 11, 2016 (the \"Redemption Date\"). Under its terms, the Series A Preferred could only be redeemed from the proceeds of the sale of the Company\u2019s equity securities. On November 11, 2016 the holder of all of our outstanding Series A Preferred exercised its right of redemption. On December 6, 2016, we entered into an agreement with the holder of the Series A Preferred setting forth the terms under which such redemption would take place (the \u201cRedemption Agreement\u201d) in lieu of paying the redemption from proceeds of the sale of equity securities. Pursuant to the Redemption Agreement, at closing the holder of the Series A Preferred will receive (i) $500,000 in cash, (ii) a 12% secured debenture evidencing the remaining $3,000,000 amount to be redeemed, $1,000,000 of which is due on or before June 1, 2017 and the remainder of which is due November 11, 2017 (the \u201cRedemption Debenture\u201d), and (iii) a 5 year warrant to purchase 500,000 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock with substantially the same terms as the expired September 2014 Warrant at an exercise price equal to 10% below the thirty (30) day volume weighted average closing price of our common stock at closing. The Redemption Debenture is secured by a lien on the Company\u2019s assets and prohibits the Company from incurring any senior indebtedness other than equipment financing in connection with the Company\u2019s business.\nIf we default under the Redemption Debenture, the creditor may seek to obtain a judgment against the Company for the remaining balance of the Redemption Debenture and attempt to foreclose on assets of the Company sufficient to repay the remaining balance of the Redemption Debenture. In the event of a default, if the Company is unable to re-negotiate the terms of the Redemption Debenture or raise sufficient capital to repay the remaining balance of the Redemption Debenture, such default could have a material adverse impact on the ongoing operations of the Company.\nThe terms set forth in the Redemption Debenture may make it difficult for us to borrow additional funds in the future.\nOther than trade debt, he terms of the Redemption Debenture prohibit us from incurring indebtedness that is senior to the Redemption Debenture. This restriction may make it difficult for us to borrow additional funds from third parties. Additionally, the Redemption Debenture is secured by a lien on the assets of the Company which may prevent us from incurring additional secured debt. If we are unable to raise additional capital through the issuance of debt such failure could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure to effectively manage our potential growth could place strains on our managerial, operational and financial resources and could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur business strategy and potential growth may place a strain on managerial, operational and financial resources and systems. Although we may not grow as we expect, if we fail to manage our growth effectively or to develop and expand our managerial, operational and financial resources and systems, our business and financial results will be materially harmed.\nRisks Related to Cchek\u00d4\nOur cancer diagnostic business is pre-revenue, and subject to the risks of an early stage biotechnology company.\nSince the Company\u2019s primary focus for the foreseeable future will likely be our cancer diagnostics business, shareholders should understand that we are primarily an early stage biotechnology company with no history of revenue-generating operations, and our only assets consist of our proprietary technologies and the know-how of our officers. Therefore we are subject to all the risks and uncertainties inherent in a new business, in particular new businesses engaged in the early detection of certain cancers. Cchek\u00d4 is in its early stages of development, and we still must establish and implement many important functions necessary to commercialize the technology.\nAccordingly, you should consider the Company\u2019s prospects in light of the costs, uncertainties, delays and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their pre-revenue generating stages, particularly those in the biotechnology field. Shareholders should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties that a business with no operating history will face. In particular, shareholders should consider that there is a significant risk that we will not be able to:\n\u00b7 demonstrate the effectiveness of Cchek\u00d4;\n\u00b7 implement or execute our current business plan, or that our current business plan is sound;\n\u00b7 raise sufficient funds in the capital markets or otherwise to fully effectuate our business plan;\n\u00b7 maintain our management team, including the members of our scientific advisory board;\n\u00b7 determine that the processes and technologies that we have developed or will develop are commercially viable; and/or\n\u00b7 attract, enter into or maintain contracts with potential commercial partners such as licensors of technology and suppliers.\nAny of the foregoing risks may adversely affect the Company and result in the failure of our business. In addition, we expect to encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known and unknown factors. At some point, we will need to transition from a company with a research and development focus to a company capable of supporting commercial activities. We may not be able to reach such achievements, which would have a material adverse effect on our Company.\nWe may have difficulty in raising capital for our cancer diagnostic business and may consume resources faster than expected.\nWe currently do not generate any revenue from Cchek\u00d4 or otherwise and as of October 31, 2016, the Company only had $3,238,000 in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Therefore, we have a limited source of cash to meet our future capital requirements, which will include the repayment of the Redemption Debentures and may include the expensive process of obtaining FDA approval for Cchek\u00d4 for each type of cancer for which we desire to launch a diagnostic test. We do not expect to generate revenues for the foreseeable future, and we may not be able to raise funds in the future, which would leave us without resources to continue our operations and force us to resort to the Company raising additional capital in the form of equity or debt financings, which may not be available to us. We may have difficulty raising needed capital in the near or longer term as a result of, among other factors, the very early stage of our diagnostic business and our lack of revenues as well as the inherent business risks associated with an early stage, biotechnology company and present and future market conditions. Also, we may consume available resources more rapidly than currently anticipated, resulting in the need for additional funding sooner than anticipated. Our inability to raise funds could lead to decreases in the price of our common stock and the failure of our cancer diagnostic business which would have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nWhile our Cchek\u00d4 diagnostic technology has shown favorable results from initial testing, we cannot guarantee that these results will be replicated in future testing nor can we guarantee the success of the technology at all.\nWe have initially used Cchek\u00d4 to test the blood of small groups of individuals consisting of cancer patients and healthy patients and have reported sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 92%. While these preliminary results far exceed existing diagnostic testing, there is no guarantee that these results will be replicable when we test a larger group of patients or at all. If we are unable to consistently attain results that are necessary for commercialization of Cchek\u00d4 , our diagnostic technology will not have any monetary value and we will be unable to generate any revenue from this technology.\nEven if we are able to attain results necessary for the commercialization of Cchek\u00d4 , our ability to commercialize the technology in the future will depend on our ability to provide evidence of clinical utility.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize Cchek\u00d4 will depend on numerous factors, including whether health care providers believe that Cchek\u00d4 provides sufficient incremental clinical utility; whether the medical community accepts that Cchek\u00d4 has sufficient sensitivity (there are no or very few false positives), specificity (detects the cancer the test is supposed to detect) and predictive value to be meaningful in patient care and treatment decisions; whether the cost of the test is reasonably priced and commercially viable; and whether health insurers, government health programs and other third-party payers will cover and pay for Cchek\u00d4 and the amount that they will reimburse for such tests. These factors may present obstacles to commercial acceptance of Cchek\u00d4 . To the extent these obstacles arise, we will need to devote substantial time and resources to overcome these obstacles, and we might not be successful. Failure to achieve widespread market acceptance of Cchek\u00d4 would materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are unable to give any assurance that we will be successful in providing sufficient evidence of clinical utility or any assurance that we will have adequate managerial, technical or financial resources to support the studies necessary to provide sufficient evidence of clinical utility of Cchek\u00d4 or to adequately differentiate our test from other diagnostic products in the manner, timeframe or cost parameters we anticipate, if at all. If we are unable to provide evidence of clinical utility and differentiate Cchek\u00d4 , we will not be able to generate the revenues and market growth that we seek. Our failure to generate revenue from the sale of our products would materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nDiagnostic test development involves a lengthy and complex process, and we may be unable to commercialize Cchek\u00d4 on a timely basis, or at all.\nWe have begun to devote considerable resources to research and development for Cchek\u00d4 , however there can be no assurance that Cchek\u00d4 will be capable of reliably predicting the occurrence or recurrence of any cancers with the sensitivity and specificity necessary to be clinically and commercially useful, or, even if such technology is clinically and commercially useful, that it will result in commercially successful products. In addition, before we can fully develop Cchek\u00d4 and commercialize any new products, we will need to:\n\u00b7 conduct substantial research and development;\n\u00b7 conduct validation studies;\n\u00b7 expend significant funds;\n\u00b7 enter into agreements and maintain relationships with third party vendors to provide third party blood samples;\n\u00b7 obtain regulatory approval (either CLIA, FDA or both); and\n\u00b7 establish or contract with the owner of a CLIA certified laboratory to process test samples.\nAccordingly, our product development process involves a high degree of risk and may take several years, especially if the Company seeks FDA approval for each of its diagnostic tests. If Cchek\u00d4 should fail at the research or development stage, not produce sufficient clinical validation data to support the effectiveness of the product or not gain regulatory approval or if we should run out of cash to devote towards the commercialization of the technology or fail to establish agreements with necessary third party vendors, we will not make it to commercialization and we will not generate any revenue from the technology.\nIf we fail to obtain, or if there are delays in obtaining, required regulatory approvals, we will not be able to commercialize our Cchek\u00d4 technology, and our ability to generate revenue and the viability of our Company will be materially impaired.\nCommercialization of Cchek\u00d4 will require that we obtain either CLIA certification, FDA approval or both. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for Cchek\u00d4 , we will be unable to commercialize and generate revenue from the technology which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnless we obtain FDA approval for Cchek\u00d4 , we will be dependent on laboratory contractors for testing of patient samples that are essential to the development and validation of Cchek\u00d4 .\nTo pursue the development and validation of Cchek\u00d4, we will require access to test results obtained from patient blood samples. We have currently contracted with Wistar to provide these services. Unless and until Cchek\u00d4 receives FDA approval, we may elect to seek CLIA certification for one or more of our Cchek\u00d4 tests. Failure to receive FDA approval or CLIA certification would have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop and validate Cchek\u00d4 .\nWe will be dependent on third parties for the patient samples that are essential to the development and validation of Cceck\u00d4.\nTo pursue our development and validation of Cchek\u00d4, we are likely to need access, over time, to patient blood samples and such patients will need to consent to the use of their blood. As a result, we have made arrangements with Wistar and neighboring hospitals and medical practices to give us access to patient samples for the development and validation of Cchek\u00d4. In the event that we are unable to obtain patient samples, or access to patient samples becomes more limited due to changes in privacy laws governing the use and disclosure of medical information or due to changes in the laws restricting our ability to obtain patient samples and associated information, our ability to pursue the development of Cchek\u00d4 may be slowed or halted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations\nOur business could be harmed from the loss or suspension of a license or imposition of a fine or penalties under, or future changes in, or changing interpretations of, the law or regulations of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act of 1967, the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or the FDA or other federal, state or local agencies.\nITUS will need to seek regulatory approval in order to market Cchek\u00d4. The clinical laboratory testing industry is subject to extensive federal and state regulation, and many of these statutes and regulations have not been interpreted by the courts. The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act of 1967, the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (collectively \u201cCLIA\u201d) are federal regulatory standards that apply to virtually all clinical laboratories (regardless of the location, size or type of laboratory), including those operated by physicians in their offices, by requiring that they be certified under federal law. CLIA does not pre-empt state law, which in some cases may be more stringent than federal law and require additional personnel qualifications, quality control, record maintenance and proficiency testing. The sanction for failure to comply with CLIA and state requirements may be suspension, revocation or limitation of a laboratory\u2019s CLIA certificate, which is necessary to conduct business, as well as significant fines and/or criminal penalties. Several states have similar laws and we may be subject to similar penalties. The FDA regulates diagnostic products and periodically inspects and reviews their manufacturing processes and product performance. We may choose to seek FDA approval for one or more Cchek\u00d4 tests, opposed to seeking CLIA certification. We cannot assure that applicable statutes and regulations will not be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that would adversely affect our business. Potential sanctions for violation of these statutes and regulations include significant fines and the suspension or loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements on us, which may be costly, including FDA regulation of laboratory developed tests.\nHealth insurers and other third-party payers may decide not to reimburse our Cchek\u00d4 diagnostic testing or may provide inadequate reimbursement, which could jeopardize our commercial prospects and require customers to pay for the tests out of pocket.\nIn the United States, the regulatory process that allows diagnostic tests to be marketed is independent of any coverage determinations made by third-party payers. For new diagnostic tests, private and government payers decide whether to cover the test, the reimbursement amount for a covered test and the specific conditions for reimbursement. Physicians may order diagnostic tests that are not reimbursed by third-party payers, but coverage determinations and reimbursement levels and conditions are critical to the commercial success of a diagnostic product. Each third-party payer makes its own decision about which tests it will cover and how much it will pay, although many payers will follow the lead of Medicare. As a result, the coverage determination process will be a time-consuming and costly process that requires us to provide scientific, clinical and economic support for the use of Cchek\u00d4 diagnostic testing to each payer separately, with no assurance that approval will be obtained. If third-party payers decide not to cover Cchek\u00d4 or if they offer inadequate payment amounts, our ability to generate revenue from Cchek\u00d4 could be limited since patients who want to take the diagnostic tests would have to pay for it out of pocket. Even if one or more third-party payers decide to reimburse for Cchek\u00d4 diagnostic testing, a third-party payer may stop or lower payment at any time, which could reduce revenue. We cannot predict whether third-party payers will cover Cchek\u00d4 diagnostic testing or offer adequate reimbursement. We also cannot predict the timing of such decisions. In addition, physicians or patients may decide not to order Cchek\u00d4 tests if third-party payments are inadequate, especially if ordering the test could result in financial liability for the patient.\nWhether or not health insurers and other third-party payers decide to reimburse Cchek\u00d4 , the technology may cost patients more than we anticipate.\nWe believe that our Cchek\u00d4 diagnostic testing will significantly reduce the cost to patients of screening and confirmatory testing for certain types of cancer. If, however, the cost to utilize Cchek\u00d4 is more expensive than we anticipate, many patients and third-party payers may elect not to utilize the technology which would significantly impact our ability to generate revenue on the technology.\nWe operate in a competitive market and expect to face intense competition, often from companies with greater resources and experience than us.\nThe clinical diagnostics industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid change. We are aware of many different types of diagnostic tests available to detect cancer that are currently in use or being developed and many more types of diagnostic tests may be developed in the future. If we are able to successfully commercialize Cchek\u00d4 , all of these tests will compete with our product. If Cchek\u00d4 is more expensive than and/or does not have sufficient specificity, sensitivity or predictive value to compete with tests that are currently on the market, or if any other diagnostic tests that are under development, once successfully developed and commercialized, have greater specificity, sensitivity or predictive value and/or are cheaper than our technology, we may be unable to compete successfully with such products which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, as the industry continues to expand and evolve, an increasing number of competitors and potential competitors may enter the market. Many of these competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technological, managerial and research and development resources and experience than we do. Some of these competitors and potential competitors have more experience than we do in the development of diagnostic products, including validation procedures and regulatory matters. In addition, Cchek\u00d4 will compete with product offerings from large and well established companies that have greater marketing and sales experience and capabilities than we do. If we are unable to compete successfully, we may be unable to sustain and grow our revenue.\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection, our competitive position will be harmed.\nOur ability to compete and to achieve sustained profitability will be impacted by our ability to protect our Cchek\u00d4 cancer diagnostic technologies and other proprietary discoveries and technologies. We expect to rely on a combination of patent protection, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, and regulatory approvals to protect Cchek\u00d4 and any of our other technologies. Our intellectual property strategy is intended to help develop and maintain our competitive position. However, there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain patent protection for Cchek\u00d4 and any other technologies, nor can we be certain that the steps we will have taken will prevent the misappropriation and unauthorized use of our technologies. If we are not able to obtain and maintain patent protection our competitive position may be harmed.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell our Cchek\u00d4 cancer diagnostic technologies and other proprietary discoveries and technologies without infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating the proprietary rights or intellectual property of third parties. We may become party to, or be threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our Cchek\u00d4 cancer diagnostic technologies and other proprietary discoveries and technologies. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future. If we are found to infringe a third-party's intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third-party to continue developing our Cchek\u00d4 cancer diagnostic technologies and other proprietary discoveries and technologies. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease developing the infringing technology or product. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties can have a similar negative impact on our business.\nWe are dependent upon a few key personnel and the loss of their services could adversely affect us.\nOur future success of developing Cchek\u00d4 will depend on the efforts of ITUS\u2019s Executive Chairman of the Board Dr. Amit Kumar. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance on Dr. Kumar. The loss of the services of Dr. Kumar could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nRisks Related to Legacy Patent Licensing Activities\nIn connection with our legacy patent licensing activities, we may not be able to license our patent portfolios which may have an adverse impact on our future operations.\nWe may generate revenues and related cash flows from the licensing and enforcement of patents that we currently own, from technologies that we develop and from the rights to license and enforce additional patents we have obtained, and may obtain in the future, from third parties. However, we can give no assurances that we will be able to identify opportunities to exploit such patents or that such opportunities, even if identified, will generate sufficient revenues to sustain future operations.\nWe, in certain circumstances, rely on representations, warranties and opinions made by third parties that, if determined to be false or inaccurate, may expose us to certain material liabilities.\nFrom time to time, we may rely upon the opinions of purported experts. In certain instances, we may not have the opportunity to independently investigate and verify the facts upon which such opinions are made. By relying on these opinions, we may be exposed to liabilities in connection with the licensing and enforcement of certain patents and patent rights which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nIn connection with patent licensing activities conducted by certain of our subsidiaries, a court that has ruled unfavorably against us may also impose sanctions or award attorney\u2019s fees, exposing us and our operating subsidiaries to certain material liabilities.\nIn connection with any of our patent licensing activities, it is possible that a court that has ruled against us may also impose sanctions or award attorney\u2019s fees to defendants, exposing us or our operating subsidiaries to material liabilities, which could materially harm our operating results and our financial condition.\nOur patented technologies have an uncertain market value.\nMany of our patents and technologies are in the early stages of adoption in the commercial and consumer markets. Demand for some of these technologies is untested and is subject to fluctuation based upon the rate at which our licensees will adopt our patents and technologies in their products and services.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe availability of shares for sale in the future could reduce the market price of our common stock.\nIn the future, we may issue securities to raise cash for operations, to pay down existing or then existing indebtedness, to pay for the development of our Cchek\u00d4 platform and for acquisitions of companies. We have and in the future may issue securities convertible into our common stock. Any of these events may dilute stockholders' ownership interests in our company and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.\nIn addition, sales of a substantial amount of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales may occur, could reduce the market price of our common stock. This could also impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of our securities.\nAny actual or anticipated sales of shares by our stockholders may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. The sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by our stockholders, or anticipation of such sales, could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise wish to effect sales.\nDelaware law and our charter documents contain provisions that could discourage or prevent a potential takeover of our company that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price of their shares.\nProvisions of Delaware General Corporation Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d) and our certificate of incorporation, as amended (the \u201cCertificate of Incorporation\u201d) and by-laws (\u201cBy-Laws\u201d) could make the acquisition of our company by means of a tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise, and the removal of incumbent officers and directors, more difficult. These provisions include:\n\u00b7 Section 203 of the DGCL, which prohibits a merger with a 15%-or-greater stockholder, such as a party that has completed a successful tender offer, until three years after that party became a 15%-or-greater stockholder;\n\u00b7 The authorization in our Certificate of Incorporation of undesignated preferred stock, which could be issued without stockholder approval in a manner designed to prevent or discourage a takeover; and\n\u00b7 Provisions in our By-Laws regarding stockholders' rights to call a special meeting of stockholders limit such rights to stockholders holding together at least a majority of shares of the Company entitled to vote at the meeting, which could make it more difficult for stockholders to wage a proxy contest for control of our Board of Directors or to vote to repeal any of the anti-takeover provisions contained in our Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws.\nTogether, these provisions may make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that could otherwise involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nWe may fail to meet market expectations because of fluctuations in quarterly operating results, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nOur reported revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the future, specifically as we continue to devote more of our resources towards our Cchek\u00d4 diagnostic technology. It is possible that in future periods, we will have no revenue or, in any event, revenues could fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. The following are among the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly from period to period:\n\u00b7 clinical trial results relating to our diagnostic technology;\n\u00b7 progress with regulatory authorities towards the certification/approval of our diagnostic technology;\n\u00b7 commercialization of our diagnostic technology; and\n\u00b7 costs related to acquisitions, alliances and licenses.\nBiotechnology company stock prices are especially volatile, and this volatility may depress the price of our common stock.\nThe stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations, and the market prices of biotechnology companies have been highly volatile. We believe that various factors may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including, among others, the following:\n\u00b7 announcements of developments in the cancer diagnostic testing industry;\n\u00b7 developments in relationships with third party vendors and laboratories;\n\u00b7 announcements of developments in our remaining patent enforcement actions;\n\u00b7 developments or disputes concerning our patents and other intellectual property;\n\u00b7 our or our competitors' technological innovations;\n\u00b7 variations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u00b7 our failure to meet or exceed securities analysts' expectations of our financial results;\n\u00b7 a change in financial estimates or securities analysts' recommendations;\n\u00b7 changes in management's or securities analysts' estimates of our financial performance;\n\u00b7 announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, capital commitments, new technologies, or patents; and\n\u00b7 the timing of or our failure to complete significant transactions.\nIn addition, we believe that fluctuations in our stock price during applicable periods can also be impacted by changes in governmental regulations in the diagnostic testing industry and/or court rulings and/or other developments in our remaining patent licensing and enforcement actions. For example, if government regulators no longer allow for the use of diagnostic technology that has not been granted FDA approval (e.g. denying products that have only received CLIA certification), the time and cost to bring our technology to market will increase which will likely have an adverse impact on our stock price.\nIn the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the objects of securities class action litigation. If our common stock was the object of securities class action litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources, which could materially harm our business and financial results.\nOur common stock is currently listed on NASDAQ Capital Market, however if our common stock is delisted for any reason, it will become subject to the SEC\u2019s penny stock rules which may make our shares more difficult to sell.\nIf our common stock is delisted from NASDAQ Capital Market, our common stock will then fit the definition of a penny stock and therefore would be subject to the rules adopted by the SEC regulating broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. The SEC rules may have the effect of reducing trading activity in our common stock making it more difficult for investors to sell their shares. The SEC\u2019s rules require a broker or dealer proposing to effect a transaction in a penny stock to deliver the customer a risk disclosure document that provides certain information prescribed by the SEC, including, but not limited to, the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker or dealer must also disclose the aggregate amount of any compensation received or receivable by him in connection with such transaction prior to consummating the transaction. In addition, the SEC\u2019s rules also require a broker or dealer to make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction before completion of the transaction. The existence of the SEC\u2019s rules may result in a lower trading volume of our common stock and lower trading prices.\nWe do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends on our common stock which may adversely impact the market price of our stock.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not plan to pay any cash dividends in the near future. Our current policy is to retain all funds and any earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business. If we do not pay dividends, our stock may be less valuable to you because a return on your investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates.", "PERMNO": 27167, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "ANIX"}
