{"cik": "1101680", "company": "DASAN ZHONE SOLUTIONS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-12", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nSet forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other documents we file with the SEC are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur level of indebtedness could adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition, and liquidity\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2018, the aggregate principal amount of our outstanding indebtedness was $45.9 million, consisting of $31.8 million in principal amount of outstanding borrowings under our short-term debt obligations and $14.1 million in long-term related party borrowings. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including additional borrowings under our credit facilities with PNC Bank, National Association, and Citibank, N.A. as lenders, and PNC Bank as agent for the lenders, which we entered into on February 27, 2019 (the \u201cPNC Facility\u201d) or other future credit facilities with other financial institutions.\nEven if we are able to obtain new financing upon a default under the secured loan agreement, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us. The level of indebtedness could have important consequences and could materially and adversely affect us in a number of ways, including:\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business or market conditions;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to use a significant portion of any future cash flow from operations to repay or service the debt, thereby reducing the amount of cash available for other purposes;\n\u2022\nmaking us more highly leveraged than some of our competitors, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage; and\n\u2022\nmaking us more vulnerable to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions and increases in interest rates.\nThe PNC Facility and the instruments governing our other indebtedness contain certain covenants, limitations, and conditions with respect to the Company that could restrict our ability to operate our business. The covenants include a maximum leverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, and a minimum liquidity covenant, as well as financial reporting obligations, and usual and customary events of default. If an event of default occurs under the PNC Facility, the agent and the lenders will be entitled to take various actions, including requiring the immediate repayment of all outstanding amounts, terminating commitments to make additional advances and selling our assets to satisfy the obligations under the outstanding indebtedness.\nIn the past, we have violated the covenants in our credit facilities and received waivers for these violations. As of December 31, 2017, we were in technical violation of covenants under the Wells Fargo Facility to pledge the stock of certain foreign subsidiaries and transfer certain funds to Wells Fargo bank accounts. On March 19, 2018, we executed an agreement with Wells Fargo, which cured the breach.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with our financial or other covenants in the future, or that any covenant violations will be waived in the future. Any acceleration of amounts due could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to generate cash flow in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our debt or to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to borrow sufficient funds to service our debt, due to borrowing base restrictions or otherwise, we may be required to sell assets, reduce capital expenditures, purchase credit insurance or obtain additional financing. We cannot assure you that we will be able to engage in any of these actions on reasonable terms, if at all.\nOur ability to obtain additional capital could require us to reduce our operations and product development and result in harm to our financial condition, our operations, our prospects and our ability to grow and compete effectively\nWe need sufficient capital to fund our ongoing operations. Our ability to meet our obligations will depend on our ability to access funds. We cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need them, our business, operations, financial condition, and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $27.7 million in cash and cash equivalents and $45.9 million in aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness, as described in the preceding Risk Factor. Our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2018 included $7.1 million in cash balances held by our international subsidiaries. Our current lack of liquidity could harm us by:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic conditions in our industry or the economy in general;\n\u2022\nrequiring substantial amounts of cash to be used for debt servicing, rather than other purposes, including operations and new product innovation;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry; and\n\u2022\ninfluencing investor and customer perceptions about our financial stability and limiting our ability to obtain financing or acquire customers.\nOur current lack of liquidity could be further harmed, and we may incur significant losses or expend significant amounts of capital if:\n\u2022\nthe market for our products develops more slowly than anticipated;\n\u2022\nwe fail to establish market share or generate revenue at anticipated levels;\n\u2022\nour capital expenditure forecasts change or prove inaccurate; or\n\u2022\nwe fail to respond to unforeseen challenges or take advantage of unanticipated opportunities.\nTo meet our liquidity needs and to finance our capital expenditures and working capital needs for our business, we may be required to raise substantial additional capital or reduce our operations. Raising additional capital could require selling assets, issuing debt or equity securities, purchasing credit insurance, borrowing additional capital or other methods. Additional capital, if required, may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all.\nIf we elect to raise additional capital through the issuance of debt securities or other debt financing, if we are able to incur additional debt at all, the terms of such debt may include unfavorable covenants, restrictions and financial ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business.\nIf we elect to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity securities, such issuance may be dilutive to existing stockholders and could reduce the trading price of our common stock. Volatility in our stock price may make it difficult and costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of common stock, preferred stock or other equity securities. Moreover, in connection with any registration statement for the sale of shares of our common stock or other securities, we may be required to include audited annual and unaudited interim historical financial statements of Legacy Zhone and/or Keymile, which may make raising additional capital through a public offering of securities more costly and time consuming.\nOur ability to grow our business requires a significant commitment of capital, and we currently lack liquid funds. If we are unable to meet our liquidity needs through obtaining additional capital on acceptable terms or reducing costs, we may become unable to maintain our existing operations, pay ordinary expenses, fund our business expansion or product innovation, pursue future business opportunities, respond to unanticipated capital requirements, or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, and liquidity. In addition, we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and sales and marketing efforts beyond the reductions that we have previously taken, and reduce operations in low margin regions, including reductions in headcount, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nDNI, the majority owner of our outstanding common stock, controls our ability to obtain financing and other matters requiring stockholder approval, and DNI\u2019s interests may conflict with our interests and the interests of other stockholders\nAs of December 31, 2018, DNI owned approximately 57.2% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Accordingly, as long as DNI and its affiliates hold shares representing a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of our outstanding common stock at a stockholder meeting, (a) DNI generally will have the ability to control the outcome of any matter submitted for the vote of our stockholders, except in certain circumstances set forth in our certificate of incorporation or bylaws, and (b) DNI will be able to freely nominate and elect all the members of our board of directors, subject only to a requirement that a certain number of directors qualify as \u201cindependent directors\u201d under Nasdaq listing rules and applicable laws.\nWe have elected to be treated as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under Nasdaq Marketplace Rules because more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting power for the election of directors is held by DNI. As a \u201ccontrolled company,\u201d we may rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements under Nasdaq Marketplace Rules, including the requirement that we have a majority of independent directors on the Board of Directors and requirements with respect to compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees.\nThe directors elected by DNI have the authority to make decisions affecting our capital structure, including the issuance of additional capital stock or options, the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the implementation of stock repurchase programs, and the declaration of dividends. The interests of DNI may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders or with holders of our indebtedness. As a result of DNI\u2019s controlling vote over matters submitted to our stockholders for approval (subject to any applicable limitations in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws), we may take actions that our stockholders or holders of our indebtedness do not view as beneficial. In addition, the existence of a controlling stockholder may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or discourage a third party from seeking to acquire us. A potential third party acquirer would be required to negotiate any such transaction with DNI, and the interests of DNI with respect to such transaction may be different from the interests of our other stockholders or with holders of our indebtedness. In addition, provisions of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and applicable laws, including Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to certain stockholders.\nWe have experienced significant losses and we may incur losses in the future. If we fail to generate sufficient revenue to sustain our profitability, our stock price could decline\nWe had net income of $2.8 million and $1.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. However, we incurred significant losses in prior years. We have an accumulated deficit of $15.8 million as of December 31, 2018. We have significant fixed expenses and expect that we will continue to incur substantial manufacturing, research and product development, sales and marketing, customer support, administrative and other expenses in connection with the ongoing development of our business. In addition, we may be required to spend more on research and product development than originally budgeted to\nrespond to industry trends. We may also incur significant new costs related to acquisitions and the integration of new technologies and other acquisitions that may occur in the future. We may not be able to adequately manage costs and expenses or achieve or maintain adequate operating margins. As a result, our ability to sustain profitability in future periods will depend on our ability to generate and sustain higher revenue while maintaining reasonable costs and expense levels. If we fail to generate sufficient revenue to sustain profitability in future periods, we may incur operating losses, which could be substantial, and our stock price could decline.\nIn connection with the Keymile Acquisition, we assumed certain of Keymile\u2019s liabilities, which could harm our business, operations, financial condition, and liquidity\nPursuant to the definitive agreement for the Keymile Acquisition, we assumed certain of Keymile\u2019s liabilities, including tax and pension liabilities, and any liabilities that may arise related to representations and warranties of Keymile in connection with a prior sale of assets with representations and warranties that survive through 2022. Although the definitive agreement for the Keymile Acquisition entitles us to indemnification for losses incurred related to any such claims or liabilities, our right to indemnification may be limited to the purchase price of Keymile, or EUR 10,250,000 and our and third party provided warranty and indemnity liability insurance coverage of up to EUR 35,285,000. If such claims or losses exceed such amount, or if they are not indemnifiable under the Keymile Acquisition definitive agreement, any such losses could negatively impact our financial situation. In addition, our closing of the Keymile Acquisition could give rise to substantial tax liabilities under German law, which could negatively impact our financial condition and liquidity.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of the Keymile Acquisition if the integration of Keymile is not implemented successfully or cost-effectively\nOur ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Keymile Acquisition will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to successfully integrate Keymile with our businesses. Integrating and coordinating certain aspects of the operations and personnel of Keymile involves complex operational, technological and personnel-related challenges. Such integration may require a significant amount of management\u2019s time and attention. The potential difficulties, and resulting costs and delays, relating to the integration of Keymile include, among others:\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from day-to-day operations;\n\u2022\nthe management of an additional subsidiary and business unit;\n\u2022\nthe assimilation of Keymile employees and the integration of the two business cultures;\n\u2022\nchallenges in attracting and retaining key personnel;\n\u2022\nthe need to integrate information, accounting, finance, sales, billing, payroll and regulatory compliance systems;\n\u2022\nchallenges in keeping existing customers and obtaining new customers; and\n\u2022\nchallenges in combining product offerings and sales and marketing activities.\nIf we are unable to implement and maintain an effective system of internal controls, the existence of one or more internal control deficiencies could result in errors in our financial statements, and substantial costs and resources may be required to rectify internal control deficiencies. If we cannot produce reliable financial reports, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, the market price of our stock could decline significantly, we may be unable to obtain additional financing to operate and expand our business, and our business, operations, financial condition, and liquidity could be materially harmed. In addition, the integration process may cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of our business. If our management is not able to effectively manage the integration process, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, our business could suffer and its results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity may be harmed.\nEven if Keymile is successfully integrated into our businesses, we may not realize the full benefits of the Keymile Acquisition, including anticipated cost synergies, growth opportunities and other financial and operating benefits, within the expected timeframe or at all. In addition, we expect to incur significant integration and restructuring expenses to realize these synergies. However, many of the expenses that will be incurred are, by their nature, difficult to estimate accurately. These expenses could, particularly in the near term, exceed the savings that we expect to achieve from elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings. Although we expect that the realization of efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses may offset incremental transaction, Keymile Acquisition-related and restructuring costs over time, we cannot give any assurance that this net benefit will be achieved in the near term, or at all. Any of these matters could adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nAny strategic acquisitions or investments we make could disrupt our operations and harm our business, operations, financial condition, and liquidity\nIntegrating acquired organizations and their products and services, including the integration of completed acquisitions, may be expensive, time-consuming and a strain on our resources and our relationships with employees, customers, distributors and\nsuppliers, and ultimately may not be successful. The benefits or synergies we may expect from the acquisition of complementary or supplementary businesses may not be realized to the extent or in the time frame we initially anticipated. Mergers and acquisitions of high-technology companies are inherently risky and subject to many factors outside of our control, and we cannot be certain that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Any failure to successfully acquire and integrate acquired organizations and their products and services could seriously harm our business, operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nSome of the risks that could affect our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses, including Keymile\u2019s telecommunication systems business, include those associated with:\n\u2022\nfailure to successfully further develop the acquired products or technology;\n\u2022\ninsufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with acquisitions and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions;\n\u2022\nconforming the acquired company\u2019s standards, policies, processes, procedures and controls with our operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, products and personnel of the acquired companies;\n\u2022\ncoordinating new product and process development, especially with respect to highly complex technologies;\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees, customers, distributors, vendors and other business partners of the companies we acquire following and continuing after the announcement of acquisition plans or transactions;\n\u2022\nhiring additional management and other critical personnel;\n\u2022\nin the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries;\n\u2022\nincreasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s time and attention away from normal daily operations of the business and the challenges of managing larger and more widespread operations resulting from acquisitions;\n\u2022\nconsolidation of facilities, integration of the acquired company\u2019s accounting, human resource and other administrative functions and coordination of product, engineering and sales and marketing functions;\n\u2022\nthe geographic distance between the companies;\n\u2022\nfailure to comply with covenants related to the acquired business;\n\u2022\nunknown, underestimated, and/or undisclosed liabilities for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark infringement claims, violations of laws, employment claims, pension liabilities, commercial disputes, tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities; and\n\u2022\nlitigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims for terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties.\nIn addition, if we do complete future acquisitions, we could:\n\u2022\nissue stock that could dilute our current stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership;\n\u2022\nconsume a substantial portion of our cash resources;\n\u2022\nincur substantial debt;\n\u2022\nassume liabilities;\n\u2022\nincrease our ongoing operating expenses and level of fixed costs;\n\u2022\nrecord goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing and potential periodic impairment charges;\n\u2022\nincur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets;\n\u2022\nincur large and immediate write-offs; and\n\u2022\nbecome subject to litigation.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, and we cannot provide assurances that these weaknesses will be effectively remediated or that additional material weaknesses will not occur in the future. If our internal control over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, prevent fraud or file our periodic reports in a timely manner, which may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and which may lead to a decline in our stock price\nWe are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, the end of our fiscal year. In making this assessment, management used the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our assessment, we have concluded that, as of December 31, 2018, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective because of the unremediated material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described below.\nOn February 20, 2017, our Audit Committee concluded, in consultation with management, and after informing our independent registered public accounting firm, that, due to incorrect application of generally accepted accounting principles that resulted in material misstatements and a restatement of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, our previously issued interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 should no longer be relied upon.\nOn March 21, 2017, our Audit Committee concluded, in consultation with management and after informing our former independent registered public accounting firm, that Legacy Zhone's unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 should also no longer be relied upon due to material errors associated with the sale and subsequent return of certain products sold in December 2014.\nIn connection with such findings, our Audit Committee commenced an independent investigation to determine whether any Legacy Zhone financial statements prior to the quarter ended June 30, 2016 contained material errors. In July 2017, our Audit Committee concluded, in consultation with management and after informing our former independent registered public accounting firm, that Legacy Zhone's unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained in its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2015, June 30, 2015, September 30, 2015 and March 31, 2016, and Legacy Zhone's audited consolidated financial statements and assessments of internal control over financial reporting for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 contained in its Annual Reports on Form 10-K should no longer be relied upon. See \u201cBusiness - Audit Committee Investigation\u201d above for additional information. Furthermore, as discussed in \u201cPart II, Item 9A. Controls and Procedures,\u201d our management has identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which were unremediated as of December 31, 2018. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the registrant\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nBased on our investigations and our discovery that incorrect applications of generally accepted accounting principles had resulted in material misstatements and a restatement of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, which continue to exist at December 31, 2018. One such weakness was that we lacked personnel with the appropriate accounting knowledge, experience and competence to control our financial close process, which resulted in an incorrect application of generally accepted accounting principles. In addition, we did not design and maintain effective controls to determine the completeness and accuracy of the accounting for complex transactions, specifically related to the Merger that occurred on September 9, 2016, which resulted in an incorrect application of generally accepted accounting principles and a restatement of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months period ended September 30, 2016 to correct material misstatements. These material weaknesses could result in a material misstatement in the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.\nOur future operating results are difficult to predict and our stock price may continue to be volatile\nAs a result of a variety of factors discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our revenues for a particular quarter are difficult to predict. Our revenue and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. The primary factors that could affect our results of operations include the following:\n\u2022\ncommercial acceptance of our products and services;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in demand for network access products;\n\u2022\nfluctuation in gross margin;\n\u2022\nour ability to attract and retain qualified and key personnel;\n\u2022\nthe timing and size of orders from customers;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our customers to finance their purchase of our products as well as their own operations;\n\u2022\nnew product introductions, enhancements or announcements by our competitors;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop, introduce and ship new products and product enhancements that meet customer requirements in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nchanges in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our company and our contract manufacturers to attain and maintain production volumes and quality levels for our products;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain sufficient supplies of sole or limited source components;\n\u2022\nincreases in the prices of the components we purchase, or quality problems associated with these components;\n\u2022\nunanticipated changes in regulatory requirements which may require us to redesign portions of our products;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting rules;\n\u2022\nintegrating and operating any acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nour ability to achieve targeted cost reductions;\n\u2022\nhow well we execute on our strategy and operating plans; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions as well as those specific to the communications, internet and related industries.\nAny of the foregoing factors, or any other factors discussed elsewhere herein, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity that could adversely affect our stock price. We anticipate that our stock price and trading volume may continue to be volatile in the future, whether due to the factors described above, volatility in public stock markets generally (particularly in the technology sector) or otherwise.\nBetween December 2016 and February 2017, the bid price for our common stock traded below the $1.00 minimum per share bid price required for continued inclusion on the Nasdaq Capital Market under Marketplace Rule 5550(a)(2). We have received letters from Nasdaq requiring us to regain compliance within a specified period. A failure to regain compliance could result in our stock being delisted, subject to a right of appeal. On February 28, 2017, we effected a one-for-five reverse stock split of our outstanding shares of common stock. As a result of this, in March 2017, we received written notification from Nasdaq advising us that we had regained compliance with the minimum bid price rule as the closing bid price of our common stock had been $1.00 per share or greater for ten consecutive business days. There can be no assurance that our stock price will remain above the minimum bid price or that we will be able to regain compliance if our stock price falls below the minimum bid price again in the future. In addition, if our average market capitalization falls below the carrying value of our assets for an extended period of time as it has done during recent years, this may indicate that the fair value of our net assets is below their carrying value, and may result in recording impairment charges.\nThe long and variable sales cycles for our products could cause revenue and operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter\nThe target customers for our products have substantial and complex networks that they traditionally expand in large increments on a periodic basis. Accordingly, our marketing efforts are focused primarily on prospective customers that may purchase our products as part of a large-scale network deployment. Our target customers typically require a lengthy evaluation, testing and product qualification process. Throughout this process, we are often required to spend considerable time and incur significant expenses educating and providing information to prospective customers about the uses and features of our products. Even after a company makes the final decision to purchase our products, it could deploy our products over extended periods of time. The timing of deployment of our products varies widely, and depends on a number of factors, including our customers\u2019 skill sets, geographic density of potential subscribers, the degree of configuration and integration required to deploy our products, and our customers\u2019 ability to finance their purchase of our products as well as their operations. As a result of any of these factors, our revenue and operating results could vary significantly from quarter to quarter.\nThe market we serve is highly competitive and we could not be able to compete successfully\nCompetition in communications equipment markets is intense. These markets are characterized by rapid change, converging technologies and a migration to networking solutions that offer superior advantages. We are aware of many companies in related markets that address particular aspects of the features and functions that our products provide. Currently, our primary competitors in our core business include ADTRAN, Calix, Huawei, Nokia and ZTE, among others. In our FiberLAN business, our competitors include Cisco, Nokia and Tellabs. In our Ethernet switching business, our competitors include Arris, Cisco, and Juniper. We also may face competition from other communications equipment companies or other companies that may enter our markets in the future. In addition, a number of companies have introduced products that address the same network needs that our products and solutions address, both domestically and internationally. Many of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases and greater financial, technical, sales and marketing resources than we do and may be able to undertake more extensive marketing efforts, adopt more aggressive pricing policies and provide more customer financing than we can. In particular, we are encountering price-focused competitors from Asia, especially China, which places pressure on us to reduce our prices. If we are forced to reduce prices in order to secure customers, we may be unable to sustain gross margins at desired levels or achieve profitability. Competitive pressures could result in increased pricing pressure, reduced profit margins, increased sales and marketing expenses and failure to increase, or the loss of, market share, any of which could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our financial results. Moreover, our competitors may foresee the course of market developments more accurately than we do and could develop new technologies that render our products less valuable or obsolete.\nIn our markets, principal competitive factors include:\n\u2022\nproduct performance;\n\u2022\ninteroperability with existing products;\n\u2022\nscalability and upgradeability;\n\u2022\nconformance to standards;\n\u2022\nbreadth of services;\n\u2022\nreliability;\n\u2022\nease of installation and use;\n\u2022\ngeographic footprints for products;\n\u2022\nability to provide customer financing;\n\u2022\npricing;\n\u2022\ntechnical support and customer service; and\n\u2022\nbrand recognition.\nIf we are unable to compete successfully against our current and future competitors, we may have difficulty obtaining or retaining customers, and we could experience price reductions, order cancellations, increased expenses and reduced gross margins, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nIf demand for our products and solutions does not develop as we anticipate, then our business operations, financial condition, and liquidity will be adversely affected\nOur future revenue depends significantly on our ability to successfully develop, enhance and market our products and solutions to our target markets. Most network service providers have made substantial investments in their current infrastructure, and they may elect to remain with their current architectures or to adopt new architectures in limited stages or over extended periods of time. A decision by a customer to purchase our products will involve a significant capital investment. We must convince our service provider customers that they will achieve substantial benefits by deploying our products for future upgrades or expansions. We may experience difficulties with product reliability, partnering, and sales and marketing efforts that could adversely affect our business and divert management attention and resources from our core business. We do not know whether a viable market for our products and solutions will develop or be sustainable in our businesses. If these markets do not develop or develop more slowly than we expect, our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity will be materially harmed.\nWe depend upon the development of new products and enhancements to existing products, and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers\u2019 changing needs, our operating results and market share may suffer\nThe markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, changes in end-user requirements, frequent new product introductions and changes in communications offerings from network service provider customers. Our future success depends on our ability to anticipate or adapt to such changes and to offer, on a timely and cost-effective basis, products that meet changing customer demands and industry standards. We may not have sufficient resources to successfully and accurately anticipate customers\u2019 changing needs and technological trends, manage long development cycles or develop, introduce and market new products and enhancements. The process of developing new technology is complex and uncertain, and if we fail to develop new products or enhancements to existing products on a timely and cost-effective basis, or if our new products or enhancements fail to achieve market acceptance, our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity would be materially adversely affected.\nBecause our products are complex and are deployed in complex environments, our products may have defects that we discover only after full deployment by our customers, which could seriously harm our business\nWe produce highly complex products that incorporate leading-edge technology, including both hardware and software. Software typically contains defects or programming flaws that can unexpectedly interfere with expected operations. In addition, our products are complex and are designed to be deployed in large quantities across complex networks. Because of the nature of these products, they can only be fully tested when completely deployed in large networks with high amounts of traffic, and there is no assurance that our pre-shipment testing programs will be adequate to detect all defects. As a result, our customers may discover errors or defects in our hardware or software, or our products may not operate as expected. If we are unable to cure a product defect, we could experience damage to our reputation, reduced customer satisfaction, loss of existing customers and failure to attract new customers, failure to achieve market acceptance, reduced sales opportunities, loss of revenue and market share, increased service and warranty costs, diversion of development resources, legal actions by our customers, and increased insurance costs. Defects, integration issues or other performance problems in our products could also result in financial or other damages to our customers. Our customers could seek damages for related losses from us, which could seriously harm our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity. A product liability claim brought against us, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time consuming and costly. The occurrence of any of these problems would seriously harm our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe rely on contract manufacturers for a portion of our manufacturing requirements\nWe rely on contract manufacturers to perform a portion of the manufacturing operations for our products. These contract manufacturers build products for other companies, including our competitors. In addition, we do not have contracts in place with some of these providers and may not be able to effectively manage those relationships. We cannot be certain that our contract manufacturers will be able to fill our orders in a timely manner. We face a number of risks associated with this dependence on contract manufacturers including reduced control over delivery schedules, the potential lack of adequate capacity during periods of excess demand, poor manufacturing yields and high costs, quality assurance, increases in prices, and the potential misappropriation of our intellectual property. We have experienced in the past, and may experience in the future, problems with our contract manufacturers, such as inferior quality, insufficient quantities and late delivery of products.\nA shortage of adequate component supply or manufacturing capacity could increase our costs or cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders, and our failure to estimate customer demand properly could result in excess or obsolete component inventories that could adversely affect our gross margins\nOccasionally, we may experience a supply shortage, or a delay in receiving, certain component parts as a result of strong demand for the component parts and/or capacity constraints or other problems experienced by suppliers. If shortages or delays persist, the price of these components may increase, or the components may not be available at all, and we may also encounter shortages if we do not accurately anticipate our needs. Conversely, we may not be able to secure enough components at\nreasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build new products in a timely manner in the quantities or configurations needed. Accordingly, our revenue and gross margins could suffer until other sources can be developed. Our operating results would also be adversely affected if, anticipating greater demand than actually develops, we commit to the purchase of more components than we need. Furthermore, as a result of binding price or purchase commitments with suppliers, we may be obligated to purchase components at prices that are higher than those available in the current market. In the event that we become committed to purchase components at prices in excess of the current market price, our gross margins could decrease. In the past we experienced component shortages that adversely affected our financial results and in the future may continue to experience component shortages.\nWe depend on a limited source of suppliers for several key components. If we are unable to obtain these components on a timely basis, we will be unable to meet our customers\u2019 product delivery requirements, which would harm our business\nWe currently purchase several key components from a limited number of suppliers. If any of our limited source of suppliers become insolvent, cease business or experience capacity constraints, work stoppages or any other reduction or disruption in output, they may be unable to meet our delivery schedules. Our suppliers may enter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors, be acquired by our competitors, stop selling their products or components to us at commercially reasonable prices, refuse to sell their products or components to us at any price or be unable to obtain or have difficulty obtaining components for their products from their suppliers. If we do not receive critical components from our limited source of suppliers in a timely manner, we will be unable to meet our customers\u2019 product delivery requirements. Any failure to meet a customer\u2019s delivery requirements could materially adversely affect our business, operations, and financial condition and liquidity and could materially damage customer relationships.\nSales to communications service providers are especially volatile, and weakness in sales orders from this industry could harm our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity\nSales activity in the service provider industry depends upon the stage of completion of expanding network infrastructures, the availability of funding, and the extent to which service providers are affected by regulatory, economic and business conditions in the country of operations. Although some service providers may be increasing capital expenditures over the depressed levels that have prevailed over the last few years, weakness in orders from this industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity. Slowdowns in the general economy, overcapacity, changes in the service provider market, regulatory developments and constraints on capital availability have had a material adverse effect on many of our service provider customers, with many of these customers going out of business or substantially reducing their expansion plans. These conditions have materially harmed our business and operating results, and we expect that some or all of these conditions may continue for the foreseeable future. Finally, service provider customers typically have longer implementation cycles; require a broader range of services including design services; demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks; often require acceptance provisions, which can lead to a delay in revenue recognition; and expect financing from vendors. All these factors can add further risk to business conducted with service providers.\nWe rely on the availability of third party licenses\nMany of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various elements of the technology used to develop these products. We cannot assure you that our existing or future third-party licenses will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Our inability to maintain or obtain any third-party license required to sell or develop our products and product enhancements could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards, or at greater cost.\nOur intellectual property rights could prove difficult to protect and enforce\nWe generally rely on a combination of copyrights, patents, trademarks and trade secret laws and commercial agreements containing restrictions on disclosure and other appropriate terms to protect our intellectual property rights. We enter into confidentiality, employee, contractor and commercial agreements with our employees, consultants and corporate partners, and control access to and distribution of our proprietary information and use of our intellectual property and technology. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products, technology or intellectual property. Monitoring unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology, particularly in foreign countries or jurisdictions where laws may not protect our proprietary rights as extensively as in the United States. We cannot assure you that our pending, or any future, patent applications will be granted, that any existing or future patents will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, or that any existing or future patents will be enforceable or that infringement by third parties will even be detected. While we are not dependent on any individual patents, if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights, we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense, time and effort required to create the innovative products.\nClaims that our current or future products or components contained in our products infringe the intellectual property rights of others may be costly and time consuming to defend and could adversely affect our ability to sell our products\nThe communications equipment industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights, that may relate to technologies and related standards that are relevant to us. From time to time, we receive correspondence from companies claiming that our products are using technology covered by or related to the intellectual property rights of these companies and inviting us to discuss or demanding licensing or royalty arrangements for the use of the technology or seeking payment for damages, injunctive relief and other available legal remedies through litigation. These companies also include third-party non-practicing entities (also known as patent trolls) that focus on extracting royalties and settlements by enforcing patent rights through litigation or the threat of litigation. These companies typically have little or no product revenues and therefore our patents could provide little or no deterrence against such companies filing patent infringement lawsuits against us. In addition, third parties have initiated and could continue to initiate litigation against our manufacturers, suppliers, distributors or even our customers alleging infringement or misappropriation of their proprietary rights with respect to existing or future products, or components of our products. For example, various proceedings have been commenced against Broadcom Corporation and other parties alleging patent infringement in various jurisdictions, and in some cases the courts have issued rulings adverse to Broadcom enjoining Broadcom from offering, distributing, using or importing products that include the challenged intellectual property. Although we are not party to these proceedings, adverse rulings or injunctive relief awarded against Broadcom or other key suppliers of components for our products could result in delays or stoppages in the shipment of affected components, or require us to recall, modify or redesign our products containing such components. Regardless of the merit of claims against us or our manufacturers, suppliers, distributors or customers, intellectual property litigation can be time consuming and costly, and result in the diversion of the attention of technical and management personnel. Any such litigation could force us to stop manufacturing, selling, distributing, exporting, incorporating or using products or components that include the challenged intellectual property, or to recall, modify or redesign such products. In addition, if a party accuses us of infringing upon its proprietary rights, we may have to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, which may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are unsuccessful in any such litigation, we could be subject to significant liability for damages and loss of our proprietary rights. Any of these events or results could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nAdverse resolution of litigation may harm our business, operations, financial condition, and liquidity\nWe are a party to various lawsuits and claims in the normal course of our business. Litigation can be expensive, lengthy, and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict. An unfavorable resolution of a particular lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nDecreased effectiveness of share-based compensation could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain employees\nWe have historically used restricted stock and stock options as a key component of our employee compensation program in order to align the interests of our employees with the interests of our stockholders, encourage employee retention and provide competitive compensation and benefit packages. If the trading price of our common stock declines, this would reduce the value of our share-based compensation to our present employees and could adversely affect our ability to retain existing or attract prospective employees. Difficulties relating to obtaining stockholder approval of equity compensation plans could also make it harder or more expensive for us to grant share-based payments to employees in the future.\nOur success largely depends on our ability to retain and recruit key personnel, and any failure to do so could harm our ability to meet key objectives\nOur future success depends upon the continued services of our Chief Executive Officer and other key employees, and our ability to identify, attract and retain highly skilled technical, managerial, sales and marketing personnel who have critical industry experience and relationships that we rely on to build and operate our business. The loss of the services of any of our key employees, including our Chief Executive Officer, could delay the development and production of our products and negatively impact our ability to maintain customer relationships, which could harm our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity. Moreover, our inability to attract and retain sufficient qualified accounting personnel with expertise in generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d) following the Merger could adversely affect our ability to maintain an effective system of internal controls or our ability to produce reliable financial reports, which could materially and adversely affect our business.\nFuture sales of our common stock could lower our stock price and dilute existing stockholders\nWe issued a total of approximately 9.5 million shares (post reverse stock split) of our common stock to DNI in connection with the Merger, and could issue additional shares of common stock to finance future acquisitions through the use of equity. DNI has the right to require us to register with the SEC resales of the shares issued in connection with the Merger from time to time. In the event that DNI exercises its registration rights with respect to such shares, such shares would become eligible for resale upon registration. Additionally, shares of our common stock are available for future sale pursuant to awards granted under our equity incentive plans. Our stock price could suffer a significant decline as a result of any sudden increase in the number of shares sold in the public market or market perception that the increased number of shares available for sale will exceed the demand for our common stock.\nThe limitation of liability and indemnification provisions could harm our stockholders\u2019 investments and discourage them from suing our directors for breach of their fiduciary duties\nThe limitation of liability and indemnification provisions in our certificate of incorporation, as restated, may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their fiduciary duties. They may also reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and officers, even though an action, if successful, might benefit us and our stockholders. A stockholder\u2019s investment may be harmed to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against directors and officers pursuant to these indemnification provisions. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers or persons controlling us pursuant to the foregoing provisions, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable. There is no pending litigation or proceeding naming any of our directors or officers as to which indemnification is being sought, nor are we aware of any pending or threatened litigation that may result in claims for indemnification by any director or officer.\nThere is a limited public market of our common stock\nThere is a limited public market for our common stock. The average daily trading volume in our common stock during the 12 months ended December 31, 2018 was approximately 23,063 shares (post reverse stock split) per day. We cannot provide assurances that a more active trading market will develop or be sustained. As a result of low trading volume in our common stock, the purchase or sale of a relatively small number of shares of our common stock could result in significant price fluctuations and it may be difficult for holders to sell their shares without depressing the market price of our common stock.\nChanges in government regulations could harm our business, operations, financial condition, and liquidity\nOur operations are subject to various laws and regulations, including those regulations promulgated by the Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d). The FCC has jurisdiction over the entire communications industry in the United States and, as a result, our existing and future products and our customers\u2019 products are subject to FCC rules and regulations. Changes to current FCC rules and regulations and future FCC rules and regulations could negatively affect our business. Non-compliance with the FCC\u2019s rules and regulations would expose us to potential enforcement actions, including monetary forfeitures, and could damage our reputation among potential customers. The uncertainty associated with future FCC decisions may cause network service providers to delay decisions regarding their capital expenditures for equipment for broadband services. In addition, international regulatory bodies establish standards that may govern our products in foreign markets. The SEC has adopted disclosure rules regarding the use of \u201cconflict minerals\u201d mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries and procedures regarding a manufacturer\u2019s efforts to prevent the sourcing of such conflict minerals. These rules may have the effect of reducing the pool of suppliers who can supply \u201cconflict free\u201d components and parts, and we may not be able to obtain \u201cconflict free\u201d products or supplies in sufficient quantities for our operations. Also, we may face reputational challenges with our customers, stockholders and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for the conflict minerals used in our products. In addition, governments and regulators in many jurisdictions have implemented or are evaluating regulations relating to cyber security, privacy and data protection, which can affect the markets and requirements for networking and communications equipment. We are unable to predict the scope, pace or financial impact of government regulations and other policy changes that could be adopted in the future, any of which could negatively impact our operations and costs of doing business. Because of our smaller size, legislation or governmental regulations can significantly increase our costs and affect our competitive position. Changes to or future domestic and international regulatory requirements could result in postponements or cancellations of customer orders for our products and services, which could harm our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity. Further, we cannot be certain that we will be successful in obtaining or maintaining regulatory approvals that could, in the future, be required to operate our business.\nCompliance or the failure to comply with current and future environmental regulations could cause us significant expense\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental regulations. If we fail to comply with any present or future regulations, we could be subject to liabilities, the suspension of production or prohibitions on the sale of our products. In addition, such regulations could require us to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations, including expenses associated with the redesign of any non-compliant product. From time to time new regulations are enacted, and it is difficult to anticipate how such regulations will be implemented and enforced and the impact that they could have on our operations or results. For example, in 2003 the European Union enacted the Restriction on the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive, for implementation in European Union member states. We are aware of similar legislation that is currently in force or has been considered in the U, S., as well as other countries, such as Japan and China. Our failure to comply with any such regulatory requirements or contractual obligations could result in us being liable for costs, fines, penalties or third-party claims, and could jeopardize our ability to conduct business in countries or jurisdictions where such regulations apply.\nOur business and future operating results are subject to global economic and market conditions\nMarket turbulence and weak economic conditions, as well as concerns about energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, business and consumer confidence, and unemployment could impact our business in a number of ways, including:\nPotential deferment of purchases and orders by customers: Uncertainty about global economic conditions could cause consumers, businesses and governments to defer purchases in response to flat revenue budgets, tighter credit, decreased cash availability and weak consumer confidence. Accordingly, future demand for our products could differ materially from our current expectations.\nCustomers\u2019 inability to obtain financing to make purchases and/or maintain their business: Some of our customers require substantial financing in order to finance their business operations, including capital expenditures on new equipment and equipment upgrades, and make purchases from us. The potential inability of these customers to access the capital needed to finance purchases of our products and meet their payment obligations to us could adversely impact our business, operations, financial condition, and liquidity. While we monitor these situations carefully and attempt to take appropriate measures to protect ourselves, including factoring credit arrangements to financial institutions, it is possible that we may have to defer revenue until cash is collected or write-down or write-off uncollectible accounts. Such write-downs or write-offs, if large, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, and liquidity. If our customers become insolvent due to market and economic conditions or otherwise, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nNegative impact from increased financial pressures on third-party dealers, distributors and retailers: We make sales in certain regions through third-party dealers, distributors and retailers. These third parties may be impacted, among other things, by a significant decrease in available credit. If credit pressures or other financial difficulties result in insolvency for these third parties and we are unable to successfully transition end customers to purchase our products from other third parties, or from us directly, it could adversely impact our business, operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nNegative impact from increased financial pressures on key suppliers: Our ability to meet customers\u2019 demands depends, in part, on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of quality materials, parts and components from our suppliers. Certain of our components are available only from a single source or limited sources. If certain key suppliers were to become capacity constrained or insolvent, it could result in a reduction or interruption in supplies or a significant increase in the price of supplies and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, credit constraints of key suppliers could result in accelerated payment of accounts payable by us, impacting our cash flow.\nWe may experience material adverse impacts on our business, operations, financial condition, and liquidity as a result of weak or recessionary economic or market conditions in the United States, Korea, Germany, or the rest of the world.\nDue to the international nature of our business, political or economic changes or other factors in a specific country or region could harm our future revenue, costs and expenses and financial condition\nWe currently have significant operations in India, Korea, and Vietnam, as well sales and technical support teams in various locations around the world. Many of our international sales may be denominated in foreign currencies. Because we do not currently engage in material foreign currency hedging transactions related to international sales, a decrease in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could result in losses from transactions denominated in foreign currencies. We expect to continue expanding our international operations in the future. The successful management and expansion of our international operations requires significant human effort and the commitment of substantial financial resources. Further, our international operations may be subject to certain risks, disruptions and challenges that could materially harm our business, operations, financial condition, and liquidity, including:\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in laws, policies and regulatory requirements, including but not limited to regulations related to import-export control;\n\u2022\ntrade protection measures, tariffs, embargoes and other regulatory requirements which could affect our ability to import or export our products into or from various countries;\n\u2022\npolitical unrest or instability, acts of terrorism or war in countries where we or our suppliers or customers have operations, including heightened security concerns stemming from North Korea in relation to our operations in Korea;\n\u2022\npolitical considerations that affect service provider and government spending patterns;\n\u2022\ndiffering technology standards or customer requirements;\n\u2022\ndeveloping and customizing our products for foreign countries;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates, foreign exchange controls and restrictions on cash repatriation;\n\u2022\nlonger accounts receivable collection cycles and financial instability of customers;\n\u2022\nrequirements for additional liquidity to fund our international operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and excessive costs for staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\nineffective legal protection of our intellectual property rights in certain countries;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences; and\n\u2022\nchanges in a country\u2019s or region\u2019s political and economic conditions.\nIn addition, some of our customer purchase agreements are governed by foreign laws and regulations, which may differ significantly from the laws and regulations of the United States. We may be limited in our ability to enforce our rights under these agreements and to collect damages, if awarded. Any of these factors could harm our existing international operations and business or impair our ability to continue expanding into international markets.\nWe face exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations\nWe conduct significant business in Korea, Japan, India, Vietnam, and Latin America, all of which subject us to foreign currency exchange rate risk.\nWe currently operate a limited hedging program to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. Moreover, the use of hedging instruments may introduce additional risks if we are unable to structure effective hedges with such instruments, which could adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nAs such, our results of operations and our cash flows could be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nIndustry consolidation may lead to increased competition and could harm our operating results\nThere has been a trend toward industry consolidation in the communications equipment market for several years. We expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations. We believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as sole-source vendors for customers. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Furthermore, rapid consolidation could result in a decrease in the number of customers we serve. The loss of a major customer could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nThe market we serve is highly competitive and we could not be able to compete successfully\nCompetition in communications equipment markets is intense. These markets are characterized by rapid change, converging technologies and a migration to networking solutions that offer superior advantages. We are aware of many companies in related markets that address particular aspects of the features and functions that our products provide. Currently, our primary competitors in our core business include ADTRAN, Calix, Huawei, Nokia, and ZTE, among others. In our FiberLANTM business, our competitors include Cisco, Nokia and Tellabs. In our Ethernet switching business, our competitors include Arris, Cisco, and Juniper. We also may face competition from other communications equipment companies or other companies that may enter our markets in the future. In addition, a number of companies have introduced products that address the same network needs that our products and solutions address, both domestically and internationally. Many of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases and greater financial, technical, sales and marketing resources than we do and may be able to undertake more extensive marketing efforts, adopt more aggressive pricing policies and provide more customer financing than we can. In particular, we are encountering price-focused competitors from Asia, especially China, which places pressure on us to reduce our prices. If we are forced to reduce prices in order to secure customers, we may be unable to sustain gross margins at desired levels or achieve profitability. Competitive pressures could result in increased pricing pressure, reduced profit margins, increased sales and marketing expenses and failure to increase, or the loss of, market share, any of which could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our financial results. Moreover, our competitors may foresee the course of market developments more accurately than we do and could develop new technologies that render our products less valuable or obsolete.\nIf we are unable to compete successfully against our current and future competitors, we may have difficulty obtaining or retaining customers, and we could experience price reductions, order cancellations, increased expenses and reduced gross margins, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nIf we experience a significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems, our business could be adversely affected\nWe rely on several centralized information technology systems to provide products and services, maintain financial records, process orders, manage inventory, process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions. If we experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, our information technology systems could be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events. Furthermore, security breaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to the company or our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, which could result in significant financial, legal or reputational damage to the company.\nThreats from cybersecurity attacks, computer viruses or acts of terrorism could disrupt our operations and harm our business, operations, financial condition, and liquidity\nDespite our implementation of network security measures, our network could be vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks, computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptions. Cybersecurity attacks, in particular, are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity\nOur daily business operations require us to retain sensitive data such as intellectual property, proprietary business information and data related to customers, suppliers and business partners within our networking infrastructure. The ongoing maintenance and security of this information is pertinent to the success of our business operations and our strategic goals.\nOur networking infrastructure and related assets could be subject to unauthorized access by hackers, employee errors, or other unforeseen activities. Such issues could result in the disruption of business processes, network degradation and system downtime, along with the potential exploitation by third parties of our critical assets such as intellectual property, proprietary business information and data related to our customers, suppliers and business partners. To the extent that such disruptions occur, they may cause delays in the manufacture or shipment of our products and the cancellation of customer orders and, as a result, our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected resulting in a possible loss of business or brand reputation.\nIn addition, the effects of war or acts of terrorism could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity. Continued threats from acts of terrorism and the heightened security and military action in response to such threats threat, or future acts of terrorism, could cause further disruption to the economy and create further uncertainties in the economy. Energy shortages, such as shortages of gas or electricity, could have similar negative impacts. To the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of customer orders or the manufacture or shipment of our products, our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business and operations are especially subject to the risks of earthquakes, hurricanes and other natural catastrophic events\nOur corporate headquarters, including a significant portion of our research and development operations, are located in Northern California, a region known for seismic activity. Additionally, some of our facilities, including our manufacturing facility in Florida, are located near geographic areas that have experienced hurricanes in the past. For example, Hurricane Irma caused substantial damage and devastation in South Florida in September 2017, including in Seminole, the location of our manufacturing facility. Natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods or other catastrophic events, could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations, and consequently, our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 89925, "SIC": 3661, "TIC": "DZSI"}
