{"cik": "1772016", "company": "BELLRING BRANDS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-11-20", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the information discussed elsewhere in this report, the following risks and uncertainties, some of which have occurred and any of which may occur in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The enumerated risks have been or may be heightened, or in some cases manifested, by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted and is expected to continue to negatively impact the global economy and capital markets. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has and we expect it to continue to impact our financial and operational performance.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has and is likely to continue to negatively impact the global economy and capital markets, which could result in a prolonged economic downturn or a global economic recession. These impacts could limit our ability to satisfy our debt obligations or the cost or availability of additional capital transactions. As of September 30, 2020, we had $703.7 million in aggregate principal amount debt and $48.7 million in cash and cash equivalents.\nIn addition, the regional or global impact of the outbreak, including official or unofficial quarantines and governmental restrictions on activities taken in response to such event, could limit our ability and the ability of our third party manufacturers to manufacture and deliver our products, which would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could include voluntary or mandatory closures of our facilities, interruptions in our supply chain, which could impact the cost or availability of materials, restrictions on our ability to deliver our products, closures of our customers and labor shortages. We believe the COVID-19 pandemic has reduced consumer demand for our products due to, among other things, changing consumer behaviors, quarantines and governmental restrictions on activities and that the closure of certain specialty stores where our products are sold has decreased the sale of our products. Additional voluntary or mandatory closure of clubs, FDM, eCommerce and other retailers where our products are sold could result in a decrease in the sale of our products. We may incur additional expenses to comply with new requirements imposed by governmental authorities, including purchases of equipment or supplies that are in high demand, as well as engaging third party resources.\nThese and other impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have heightened, or in some cases manifested, many of the other risks disclosed herein, any of which could have a material effect on us. This situation is changing rapidly and additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of as of the date hereof. The extent and potential short and long term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, which could be material, will depend on future developments, including the duration, severity and spread of the pandemic, actions that have and may be taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic, changing consumer behaviors and the impact on our supply chain, operations, workforce and the financial markets, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nA substantial amount of our net sales comes from our RTD protein shakes, and a decrease in sales of our RTD protein shakes would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA substantial amount of our net sales is derived from our RTD protein shakes. Sales of our RTD protein shakes represented approximately 80.7% of our net sales in our year ended September 30, 2020. We believe that sales of our RTD protein shakes will continue to constitute a substantial amount of our net sales for the foreseeable future. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows would be harmed by a decline in the market for our RTD protein shakes, increased competition in the market for those products, disruptions in our ability to produce those products, whether due to manufacturer inability, supply chain failures or otherwise, or our failure or inability to provide sufficient investment to support and market those products as needed to maintain or grow their competitive position or to achieve more widespread market acceptance.\nWe operate in a category with strong competition.\nThe convenient nutrition category is highly competitive. We compete with other brands in the convenient nutrition category and with many nutritional food and beverage players, as well as manufacturers of private label and store brand products. Many of our competitors offer products similar to our products, or a wider range of products than we offer, and may offer their products at more competitive prices than we do. Competition in our industry is based on, among other things, product quality, taste, functional benefits, nutritional value and ingredients, convenience, brand loyalty and positioning, product variety, product packaging, shelf space, price, promotional activities and the ability to identify and satisfy dynamic, emerging consumer preferences. Some of our principal competitors have substantially more financial, marketing and other resources than we have. Our category also includes a number of smaller competitors, many of whom offer products similar to ours and may have unique ties to retailers. A strong competitive response from one or more of our competitors to our marketplace efforts, or a\nshift in consumer preferences to competitors\u2019 products, could result in us reducing pricing, increasing marketing or other expenditures or losing market share. Competitive pressures also may restrict our ability to increase our prices, including in response to cost increases. Our profits could decrease if a reduction in prices or increased costs are not counterbalanced with increased sales volume. In addition, our competitors are increasingly using social media networks to advertise products. If we are unable to use social media effectively to advertise our products, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are currently dependent on a limited number of third party contract manufacturers for the manufacturing of most of our products, including one manufacturer for the substantial majority of our RTD protein shakes. Our business could suffer as a result of a third party contract manufacturer\u2019s inability to produce our products for us in the quantities required, on time or to our specifications.\nAll of our RTD protein shakes and most of our other products are manufactured by a limited number of independent third party contract manufacturers. For our year ended September 30, 2020, approximately 71.3% of our Premier Protein RTD shake supply came from a single manufacturer and approximately 39.3% from a single facility of that manufacturer. Although we have added additional contract manufacturers of our Premier Protein RTD shakes to our third party contract manufacturing network, our number of third party contract manufacturers is still limited and if one or more of our third party contract manufacturers is unable to meet our supply requirements, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We are currently in litigation with a former third party contract manufacturer, which we had expected to produce less than 10% of our RTD protein shakes for our year ended September 30, 2019, that resulted in our termination of our agreement with it. Also, if we experience significant increases in demand for our products, we and these third party contract manufacturers may not be able to obtain in a timely manner the equipment or packaging materials required to manufacture our products (including, in particular, the RTD protein shakes in the 11 ounce size) and allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements, fill our orders in a timely manner or meet our quality standards. Further, we may experience operational difficulties with any of these third party contract manufacturers, such as limitations on production capacity, failure to meet our quantity requirements, including as a result of pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) or other outbreaks of contagious diseases, increases in manufacturing costs, errors in complying with product specifications, insufficient quality control and failure to meet production deadlines. In addition, we rely in part on our independent third party contract manufacturers to maintain the quality of our products. The failure or inability of our independent third party contract manufacturers to comply with the specifications and requirements of our products could result in product withdrawal or recall, which could materially and adversely affect our reputation and subject us to significant liability should the consumption of any of our products cause or be claimed to cause illness or physical harm. The inability of third party contract manufacturers to ship orders in a timely manner, in desirable quantities or to meet our safety, quality and social compliance standards or regulatory requirements could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, our business could be adversely affected if any of these third parties fail to comply with governmental regulations applicable to the manufacturing of our products or if any of these third parties cease doing business with us or go out of business.\nCertain of our relationships with these third parties are subject to minimum volume commitments, whereby the third party contract manufacturer has committed to produce, and we have committed to purchase, a minimum quantity of product, and we or the contract manufacturer may alternatively pay the other a mostly fixed amount rather than produce or purchase the minimum quantities. Despite the minimum volume commitments, we may nonetheless experience situations where such manufacturers are unable to fulfill their minimum volume obligations under our agreements or cannot produce sufficient amount of product to meet consumer demand. For example, due to better than expected volume growth for our Premier Protein RTD shakes and delays in planned incremental production capacity by our third party contract manufacturer network, our customer demand exceeded our available capacity and resulted in inventory below acceptable levels at September 30, 2018. If we need to replace an existing third party contract manufacturer, our products may not be available when required on acceptable terms, or at all. Also, if demand for our products is significantly below our expectations, we may be obligated to pay penalties to our third party manufacturers for failing to purchase contracted minimum purchase quantities,\nOur reliance on a limited number of suppliers for certain ingredients and packaging materials, the price and availability of ingredients and packaging materials, higher freight costs and higher energy costs could negatively impact profits.\nWe rely on a limited number of third party suppliers to provide certain ingredients used in our business. The primary ingredients used in our business include milk-based, whey-based and soy-based proteins, protein blends, sweeteners and vitamin and mineral blends, and one supplier provides the majority of our milk-based protein. The supply and price of these ingredients are subject to market conditions and are influenced by many factors beyond our control, including pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) or other outbreaks of contagious diseases, animal feed costs, weather patterns affecting ingredient production, governmental programs and regulations, insects, plant diseases and inflation. Our primary packaging materials include aseptic foil and plastic lined cardboard cartons, flexible and rigid plastic film and containers, beverage packaging and corrugate. We utilize a sole supplier for the aseptic packaging for, and our third party contract manufacturers use equipment\nfrom the same sole supplier to manufacture, our Premier Protein RTD shakes in the 11 ounce size. Although we maintain relationships with suppliers with the objective of ensuring that we have adequate sources for the supply of such ingredients and packaging materials, increases in demand for such items, both within our industry and in general, can result in shortages and higher costs. Our suppliers may not be able to meet our delivery schedules, we may lose a significant or sole supplier, a supplier may not be able to meet performance and quality specifications and we may not be able to purchase such items at a competitive cost. Further, the cost of ingredients and packaging materials may fluctuate widely, and we may experience shortages in certain items as a result of limited availability, increased demand, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) or other outbreaks of contagious diseases, weather conditions and natural disasters, as well as other factors outside of our control. Our freight costs may increase due to factors such as limited carrier availability, increased fuel costs, increased compliance costs associated with new or changing government regulations, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) or other outbreaks of contagious diseases and inflation. Higher prices for natural gas, propane, electricity and fuel also may increase our ingredient, production and delivery costs. The prices charged for our products may not reflect changes in our ingredient, packaging material, freight, tariff and energy costs at the time they occur, or at all.\nThe loss of key supply sources, for any reason, our inability to obtain necessary quantities of ingredients and packaging materials or changes in freight or energy costs may limit our ability to maintain existing margins and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If we fail, or are unable, to hedge and prices subsequently increase, or if we institute a hedge and prices subsequently decrease, our costs may be greater than anticipated or greater than our competitors\u2019 costs, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nWe must identify changing consumer and customer preferences and behaviors and develop and offer products to meet these preferences.\nConsumer and customer preferences and behaviors evolve over time due to a variety of factors. The success of our business depends on our ability to identify these changing preferences and behaviors and to continue to develop and offer products that appeal to consumers and customers through the sales channels that they prefer. Consumer preference and behavior changes include dietary trends, attention to different nutritional aspects of foods and beverages, consumer in-home and on-the-go consumption patterns, preferences for certain sales channels, such as eCommerce, concerns regarding the health effects of certain foods and beverages, sourcing practices relating to ingredients and environmental concerns regarding packaging. Several of our customers have announced goals to transition to recyclable, compostable or reusable packaging. These changing preferences and requirements could require us to use specially sourced ingredients and packaging types that may be more difficult to source or entail a higher cost or incremental capital investment which we may not be able to pass on to customers.\nFor instance, during the third quarter and, to a lesser extent the fourth quarter, of fiscal 2020, sales of our products were negatively impacted by lower demand resulting from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on various channels. If these trends continue into the future and we are unable to adapt our business in response to these consumer behaviors, or if we fail to quickly respond if and as they moderate or reverse, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted. Consumers are increasingly shopping through eCommerce websites and mobile commerce applications, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, and this trend is significantly altering the retail landscape in our category. If we are unable to effectively compete in the expanding eCommerce market or develop the data analytics capabilities needed to generate actionable commercial insights, our business performance may be impacted, which may negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nEmerging science and theories regarding health are constantly evolving, and products or methods of eating once considered healthy may over time become disfavored by consumers or no longer be perceived as healthy. Approaches regarding healthy lifestyles also are the subject of numerous studies and publications, often with differing views and opinions, some of which may be adverse to us. In order to respond to new and evolving consumer and customer demands, achieve market acceptance and keep pace with new nutritional, technological and other developments, we must constantly introduce new and innovative products into the market. We may not be successful in developing, introducing on a timely basis or marketing any new or enhanced products, and specifically, the initial sales volumes for new or enhanced products may not reach anticipated levels, we may be required to engage in extensive marketing efforts to promote such products, the costs of developing and promoting such products may exceed our expectations and such products may not perform as expected. Further, certain ingredients used in our products may become negatively perceived by consumers, resulting in decreased demand for our products or reformulation of existing products to remove such ingredients, which may negatively affect taste or other qualities. Prolonged negative perceptions concerning the health implications of certain food and beverage products could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs.\nAlthough we strive to respond to consumer preferences and social expectations, we may not be successful in these efforts. Any significant changes in consumer or customer preferences or our inability to anticipate or react, or effectively introduce new\nproducts in response, to such changes could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur results may be adversely impacted if consumers do not maintain favorable perceptions of our brands.\nMaintaining and continually enhancing the value of our brands is critical to the success of our business. Brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions. Success in promoting and enhancing brand value depends, to a significant extent, on our ability to provide high-quality products. Brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including our products becoming unavailable to consumers, our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, adverse publicity about our products, packaging or ingredients, concerns about food safety, real or perceived health concerns regarding our products or consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner. Consumer demand for our products also may be impacted by changes in the level of advertising or promotional support. We may need to increase our marketing and advertising spending in order to maintain and increase customer and consumer awareness, protect and grow our existing market share or to promote new products, which could impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. However, an increase in our marketing and advertising efforts may not maintain our current reputation or lead to an increase in brand awareness. The growing use of social and digital media by consumers, us and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about us, our brands, products or packaging or the food and beverage industry generally on social or digital media (whether factual or not) or security breaches related to use of our social media could seriously damage our brands and reputation. If we do not maintain favorable perceptions of our products and our brands, including if we are unable to respond effectively to negative posts or comments or erroneous statements about our products on social or digital media, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, our success in maintaining and enhancing our brand image depends on our ability to anticipate change and adapt to a rapidly changing marketing and media environment, including our increasing reliance on social media and online, digital and mobile dissemination of marketing and advertising campaigns and the increasing accessibility and speed of dissemination of information. Furthermore, third parties may sell counterfeit or imitation versions of our products that are inferior or pose safety risks. If consumers confuse these counterfeit products for our products or have a bad experience with the counterfeit brand, they might refrain from purchasing our brands in the future, which could harm our brand image and sales. If we do not successfully maintain and enhance our reputation and brand health, then our brands, product sales, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nDisruption of our supply chain, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and changes in weather conditions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur ability to make, move and sell products in coordination with our suppliers, business partners and third party contract manufacturers is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our collective supply, manufacturing or distribution capabilities resulting from weather, freight carrier availability, any potential effects of climate change, natural disaster, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) or other outbreaks of contagious diseases, fire, explosion, cyber-attacks, terrorism, strikes, repairs or enhancements at facilities manufacturing or delivering our products or other reasons could impair our ability to manufacture, sell or timely deliver our products.\nChanges in weather conditions and natural disasters, such as fires, floods, droughts, frosts, hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, insect infestations and plant disease, also may affect the cost and supply of commodities used as raw materials, including milk-based, whey-based and soy-based proteins, protein blends, sweeteners and vitamin and mineral blends. Further, as we rely on a limited number of third party suppliers to provide certain ingredients and packaging materials, and one supplier for the majority of our milk-based protein, adverse events affecting such suppliers may limit our ability to obtain such raw materials, or alternatives for these raw materials, at competitive prices, or at all. For example, for our year ended September 30, 2020, approximately 71.3% of our Premier Protein RTD shake supply came from our largest contract manufacturer, with approximately 39.3% of our Premier Protein RTD shake supply manufactured at its Joplin, Missouri facility. In 2011, a major tornado struck Joplin, Missouri, but our supply of product from the Joplin, Missouri facility was not impacted. In addition, production of the RTD protein shakes in the 11 ounce size by our third party contract manufacturers requires packaging that we currently are sourcing from only one supplier, and equipment that our third party contract manufacturers are currently sourcing from the same supplier. Our supply of packaging for our 11 ounce RTD protein shakes from this supplier comes primarily from three of its locations. Competitors can be affected differently by weather conditions and natural disasters depending on the location of their suppliers and operations.\nFailure to take adequate steps to reduce the likelihood or mitigate the potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, particularly when an ingredient or packaging material is sourced from a single location or supplier, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and/or require additional resources to restore our supply chain. During fiscal 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted, and we expect will continue to impact, our operations. We continue to actively monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our supply chain.\nConsolidation in our distribution channels, and competitive, economic and other pressures facing our customers, may hurt our profit margins.\nOver the past several years, our channels have undergone significant consolidations and mass merchandisers and non-traditional retailers are gaining market share. As this trend continues and such customers grow larger, they may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency, lower pricing, increased reliance on their own brand name products, increased emphasis on generic and other value brands and increased promotional programs. If we are unable to respond to these requirements, our profitability or volume growth could be negatively impacted. Additionally, if any of our customers are consolidated with another entity and the surviving entity of any such consolidation is not a customer or decides to discontinue purchasing our products, we may lose significant amounts of our preexisting business with the acquired customer. Further, the economic and competitive landscape for our customers is constantly changing, such as the emergence of new sales channels like eCommerce, and our customers\u2019 responses to those changes could impact our business. Consolidation in our channels also increases the risk that adverse changes to our customers\u2019 business operations or financial performance, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, would have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur sales and profit growth are dependent upon our ability to expand existing market penetration and enter into new markets.\nSuccessful growth depends on our ability to add new customers, enter into new markets, expand the number of products sold through existing customers and enhance our product portfolio. This growth would include expanding the number of our products retailers offer for sale, our product placement and our ability to secure additional shelf or retail space for our products, as well as increased access to online platforms to sell our products. The expansion of our business depends on our ability to obtain new, or expand our business with existing, customers, such as club, FDM, eCommerce, convenience and specialty customers. Our failure to successfully add new customers, enter into new markets, expand the number of products sold through existing customers and enhance our product portfolio could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf our products become contaminated or adulterated, or if they are misbranded or mislabeled, we might need to recall or withdraw those items and we may experience product liability claims.\nSelling food products, beverages and nutritional supplements involves a number of legal and other risks, including contamination, spoilage, tampering, mislabeling or other adulteration. Additionally, many of the raw materials used to make certain of our products, particularly milk-based protein and nuts, are vulnerable to spoilage and contamination by naturally occurring molds and pathogens, such as salmonella, and pests. We may need to recall or withdraw some or all of our products if they become contaminated, adulterated, mislabeled or misbranded, whether caused by us or someone in our manufacturing or supply chain. A recall or withdrawal could result in destruction of product inventory, negative publicity, temporary plant closings for us or our third party contract manufacturers, supply chain interruption, substantial costs of compliance or remediation, fines and increased scrutiny by federal, state and foreign regulatory agencies. Should consumption of any product cause injury, we may be liable for monetary damages as a result of a judgment against us. In addition, adverse publicity, including claims, whether or not valid, that our products or ingredients are unsafe or of poor quality, may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions. Any of these events, including a significant product liability claim against us, could result in a loss of consumer confidence in our products. Although we have various insurance programs in place and may have rights to indemnification in certain situations, any of these events or a loss of consumer confidence could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nViolations of laws or regulations by us or our third party contract manufacturers, as well as new laws or regulations or changes to existing laws or regulations, could adversely affect our business.\nOur business is subject to a variety of laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local government authorities in the U.S., as well as government authorities outside the U.S., including requirements related to food safety, quality, manufacturing, processing, storage, marketing, advertising, labeling, distribution and worker health and workplace safety. Our activities, both inside and outside of the U.S., are subject to extensive regulation. In the U.S., we are regulated by, and our activities are affected by, among other federal, state and local authorities and regulations, the FDA, the USDA, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and California\u2019s Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (Proposition 65). In Europe, we are regulated by, among other authorities, the U.K.\u2019s Food Standards Agency, Health and Safety Executive, Environment Agency, Environmental Health, the Information Commissioners Office and the Trading Standards Office and their equivalents in E.U. member states. We also are regulated by similar authorities elsewhere in the world where our products are distributed. Governmental regulations also affect taxes and levies, tariffs, import and export restrictions, healthcare costs, energy usage, data privacy and immigration and labor issues, any or all of which may have a direct or indirect effect on our business or the businesses of our customers or suppliers. In addition, we could be the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal, state and foreign laws and regulations.\nThe impact of current laws and regulations, changes in, or changes in interpretations of, these laws or regulations or the introduction of new laws or regulations could increase the costs of doing business for us or our customers or suppliers, causing our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows to be adversely affected. Further, if we are found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations in these areas, we could be subject to civil remedies, including fines, revocations of required licenses, detention, seizure, injunctions or recalls, as well as potential criminal sanctions, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIt also is possible that federal, state, local or foreign enforcement authorities might take regulatory or enforcement action, which could result in significant fines or penalties, revocations of required licenses or injunctions, as well as potential criminal sanctions. If we are found to be significantly out of compliance, an enforcement authority could issue a warning letter and/or institute enforcement actions that could result in additional costs, substantial delays in production or even a temporary shutdown in manufacturing and product sales. Also, we may have to recall product or otherwise remove product from the market, and temporarily cease its manufacture and distribution, which would increase our costs and reduce our revenues. Any product liability claims resulting from the failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations would be expensive to defend and could result in substantial damage awards against us or harm our reputation. Any of these events would negatively impact our revenues and costs of operations.\nWe also may be impacted by changes to administrative policies, such as business restrictions, tariffs and trade agreements, in markets in which we or our third party manufacturers manufacture, sell or distribute our products. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in quarantines, import and export restrictions, price controls, governmental and regulatory actions, mandatory business closures and other restrictions that could adversely impact our operations.\nCertain of our products are subject to a higher level of regulatory scrutiny, resulting in increased costs of operations and the potential for delays in product sales.\nCertain of our products are regulated by the FDA as dietary supplements, which are subject to FDA regulations and levels of regulatory scrutiny different from those applicable to conventional food. Internationally, the convenient nutrition category is regulated as food and dietary supplements and, in some cases, may be regulated as drug products. Such heightened regulatory scrutiny results in increased costs of operations and the potential for delays in product sales. In addition, there is some risk that product classifications could be changed by the regulators, which could result in significant fines, penalties, discontinued distribution and relabeling costs. Any of these events would negatively impact our revenues and costs of operations.\nWe may not be able to effectively manage our growth, which could materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur growth has placed, and we expect that our continued growth may place, a significant demand on our management, personnel, systems and resources. Our continued growth will require an increased investment by us in our contract manufacturing relationships, personnel, technology, facilities and financial and management systems and controls, including monitoring and assuring our compliance with applicable regulations. We will need to integrate, train and manage a growing employee base. Unless our growth results in an increase in our revenues that is proportionate to the increase in our costs associated with this growth, our operating margins and profitability will be adversely affected. If we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially harmed.\nIf we pursue acquisitions or other strategic transactions, we may not be able to successfully consummate favorable transactions or successfully integrate acquired businesses.\nFrom time to time, we may evaluate potential acquisitions or other strategic transactions. Evaluating potential transactions, including divestitures, requires additional expenditures (including legal, accounting and due diligence expenses, higher administrative costs to support the acquired entities and information technology, personnel and other integration expenses) and may divert the attention of our management from day-to-day operating matters. Companies or operations we acquire or joint ventures we enter into may not be profitable or may not achieve the anticipated profitability that justify our investments.\nWith respect to acquisitions, we may not be able to identify suitable candidates, consummate a transaction on terms that are favorable to us or achieve expected returns and other benefits as a result of integration challenges. The successful integration of acquisitions is complex and depends on our ability to manage the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses. Potential difficulties we may encounter as part of the integration process include, but are not limited to, the following: employees may voluntarily or involuntarily separate from employment with us or the acquired businesses because of the acquisitions; our management may have its attention diverted while trying to integrate the acquired businesses; we may encounter obstacles when incorporating the acquired businesses into our operations and management; we may be required to recognize impairment charges; and integration may be more costly or more time consuming and complex or less effective than anticipated. With respect to proposed divestitures of assets or businesses, we may encounter difficulty in finding acquirers or alternative exit strategies on terms that are favorable to us, which could delay the accomplishment of our strategic objectives, or our divestiture activities may require us to recognize impairment charges.\nOur corporate development activities may present financial and operational risks and may have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers. Future acquisitions also could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities and amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and increased operating expenses, all of which could, individually or collectively, adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFluctuations in our business due to changes in our promotional activities and seasonality may have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe periodically offer a variety of sales and promotional incentives to our customers and consumers. Our net sales and profitability are impacted by the introduction and discontinuance of such sales and promotion incentives. In addition, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations due to the seasonal nature of our business. Seasonality could cause our results of operations for an interim financial period to fluctuate and not be indicative of our full year results. Seasonality also impacts relative revenue and profitability of each quarter of the year, both on a quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year basis. If we fail to effectively manage our inventories, fluctuations in business as a result of promotional activities and seasonality may have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe international portion of our business subjects us to additional risks.\nIn addition to other risks related to our international business disclosed herein, we are subject to a number of risks related to doing business internationally, any of which could significantly harm our business. These risks include restrictions on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries, including potentially negative tax consequences; increased exposure to general market and economic conditions outside of the U.S.; political and economic uncertainty and volatility; the difficulty and costs of designing and implementing an effective control environment across diverse regions and employee bases; and unfavorable and/or changing foreign tax treaties and policies.\nLoss of, a significant reduction of purchases by or bankruptcy of a major customer may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA limited number of customer accounts represents a large percentage of our combined net sales. Our largest customers, Costco and Walmart and its affiliates (which includes Sam\u2019s Club), accounted for approximately 67.3% of our net sales in our year ended September 30, 2020.\nThe success of our business depends, in part, on our ability to maintain our level of sales and product distribution through the club, FDM, eCommerce, specialty and convenience channels. The competition to supply products to these high-volume stores is intense. Currently, we do not have material long-term supply agreements with our customers, and our customers frequently reevaluate the products they carry. A decision by our major customers to decrease the amount of product purchased from us, sell another brand on an exclusive or priority basis or change the manner of doing business with us could reduce our revenues and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In the event of a loss of any of our large customers, a significant reduction of purchases by any of our large customers or the bankruptcy or serious financial difficulty of any of our large customers, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nPending and future litigation and claims may impair our reputation or lead us to incur significant costs.\nWe are, or may become, party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business, which may include lawsuits or claims relating to contracts, third party contract manufacturers, intellectual property infringement, product recalls, product liability, false or deceptive advertising, employment matters, environmental matters or other aspects of our business. There has been a recent increase in lawsuits filed against food and beverage companies alleging deceptive advertising and labeling. Lawsuits and claims could be expensive and time consuming to defend and could divert management\u2019s attention and resources and negative publicity resulting from allegations made in lawsuits or claims asserted against us, whether or not valid, may adversely affect our reputation. We may be required to pay damage awards or settlements, become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, be required to modify our business processes, practices or products or be required to stop selling certain of our products. In addition, intellectual property infringement litigation or claims could cause us to cease making, licensing or using products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property, require us to redesign or rebrand our products or packaging, if feasible, or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a third party\u2019s intellectual property. Any or all of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The outcome of litigation is often difficult to predict, and the outcome of pending or future litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAlthough we have various insurance programs in place, the potential liabilities associated with lawsuits and claims could be excluded from coverage or, if covered, could exceed the coverage provided by such programs. In addition, insurance carriers\nmay seek to rescind or deny coverage with respect to pending or future claims or lawsuits. If we do not have sufficient coverage under our policies, or if coverage is denied, we may be required to make material payments to settle litigation or satisfy any judgment. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur market size and related estimates may prove to be inaccurate.\nData for the convenient nutrition category is collected for most, but not all, channels, and as a result, it is difficult to estimate the size of the market and predict the rate at which the market for our products will grow. We estimate the market size of the convenient nutrition category, including by geography, product form and consumer need state, based, in part, upon forecasts and information obtained from independent trade associations, industry publications and surveys and other independent sources, proprietary research studies and management\u2019s knowledge of the industry. While these estimates are made in good faith and are based on assumptions and estimates we believe to be reasonable, they may not be accurate.\nEconomic downturns could limit consumer and customer demand for our products.\nThe willingness of consumers to purchase our products depends in part on general or local economic conditions and consumers\u2019 discretionary spending habits. In periods of adverse or uncertain economic conditions, consumers may shift purchases to lower-priced or other perceived value offerings or may forgo certain purchases altogether. In addition, distributors and retailers may seek to reduce their inventories in response to those economic conditions. In those circumstances, we could experience a reduction in sales of our products. Further, during economic downturns, it may be more difficult to convince consumers to switch to, or continue to use, our brands or convince new users to choose our brands without expensive sampling programs and price promotions. Additionally, as a result of economic conditions or competitive actions, we may be unable to raise our prices sufficiently to protect profit margins. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nU.S. and global capital and credit market issues could negatively affect our liquidity, increase our costs of borrowing and disrupt the operations of our suppliers and customers.\nU.S. and global credit markets have, from time to time, experienced significant dislocations and liquidity disruptions which caused the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably. These circumstances materially impacted liquidity in the debt markets, making financing terms for borrowers less attractive and in certain cases resulted in the unavailability of certain types of debt financing. Events affecting the credit markets also have had an adverse effect on other financial markets in the U.S., which may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of common stock or other equity securities or refinance debt, sell our assets or borrow more money, if necessary. Our business also could be negatively impacted if our suppliers or customers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy. Any of these risks could impair our ability to fund our operations or limit our ability to expand our business or increase our interest expense, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanging currency exchange rates may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have operations and assets in the U.S. as well as foreign jurisdictions, and a portion of our contracts and revenues are denominated in foreign currencies. Our financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars. We therefore must translate our foreign assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses into U.S. dollars at applicable exchange rates. Consequently, fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect the value of these items in the financial statements. In addition, since many of our sales in foreign jurisdictions are denominated in U.S. dollars, fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may effectively increase the price of our products in the currency of the jurisdiction in which the sale took place. To the extent we fail to manage our foreign currency exposure adequately, we may suffer losses in the value of our net foreign currency investment, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected.\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands.\nWe consider our intellectual property rights, particularly our trademarks, but also our patents, trade secrets, know-how and copyrights, to be a significant and valuable asset of our business. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as third party nondisclosure, confidentiality and assignment agreements and confidentiality provisions in third party agreements and the policing of third party misuses of our intellectual property. Our failure or inability to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights, or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of intellectual property, may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business.\nWe also are subject to risks associated with protection of our trademarks and other intellectual property licensed to distributors of our products and of our trade secrets to our third party contract manufacturers. If our licensed distributors or third party contract manufacturers fail to protect our trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property, either intentionally or unintentionally, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nTechnology failures, cybersecurity incidents and corruption of our data privacy protections could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store operating and financial information, to manage and support a variety of business processes and activities and to comply with regulatory, legal and tax requirements. Our reliance on information technology networks and systems has increased as a result of remote working we have implemented for certain office employees as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our and our third party manufacturing and distribution facilities and inventory management utilize information technology to increase efficiencies and control costs. Our and our third party vendors\u2019 information technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions due to events beyond our or their control, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, power outages, computer viruses, ransomware and malware, hardware or software failures, cybersecurity incidents, hackers and other security issues. Such interruptions could negatively impact our business.\nIf we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure and to maintain and protect the related automated and manual control processes, or if one of our third party service providers fails to provide the services we require, we could be subject to billing and collection errors, business disruptions or damage resulting from such events, particularly material security breaches and cybersecurity incidents. Cyberattacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently, are constantly evolving in nature, are becoming more sophisticated and are being made by groups and individuals (including criminal hackers, hacktivists, state-sponsored institutions, terrorist organizations and individuals or groups participating in organized crime) with a wide range of expertise and motives (including monetization of corporate, payment or other internal or personal data, theft of trade secrets and intellectual property for competitive advantage and leverage for political, social, economic and environmental reasons).\nIf any of our significant information technology systems suffers severe damage, disruption or shutdown, and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our product sales, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected, and we could experience delays in reporting our financial results. In addition, there is a risk of business interruption, litigation and reputational damage from leaks of confidential or personal information. While we have insurance programs in place related to these matters, the potential liabilities associated with such events, or those that could arise in the future, could be excluded from coverage or, if covered, could exceed the coverage provided by such programs. Although we have not detected a material security breach or cybersecurity incident to date, we have been the target of events of this nature and expect them to continue.\nWe also are subject to an evolving body of federal, state and foreign laws, regulations, guidelines and principles regarding data privacy, data protection and data security. Several foreign governments, including the E.U., have laws and regulations dealing with the collection and use of personal information obtained from their data subjects, and we could incur substantial penalties or litigation related to violations of such laws and regulations.\nImpairment in the carrying value of intangible assets could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. If our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, we will be required to record additional impairment charges, which may be significant.\nOur balance sheet includes intangible assets, including goodwill, trademarks, trade names and other acquired intangibles. Goodwill is expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows and is not amortized, but our management reviews it for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may be impaired. Impairments to intangible assets may be caused by factors outside of our control, such as increasing competitive pricing pressures, lower than expected revenue and profit growth rates, changes in industry earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d) and revenue multiples, changes in discount rates based on changes in cost of capital (interest rates, etc.) or the loss or bankruptcy of a significant customer. These factors, along with other internal and external factors, could have a significant negative impact on our fair value determination, which could then result in a material impairment charge in our results of operations. No impairments were recorded in the years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018. However, we could have impairments in the future.\nWe are subject to environmental laws and regulations that can impose significant costs and expose us to potential financial liabilities.\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and the environment, including those limiting the discharge and release of pollutants into the environment and those regulating the transport, storage, disposal and remediation of, and exposure to, solid and hazardous wastes. Certain environmental laws\nand regulations can impose joint and several liability without regard to fault on responsible parties, including past and present owners and operators of sites, related to cleaning up sites at which hazardous materials were disposed of or released.\nFailure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could result in severe fines and penalties by governments or courts of law. In addition, future laws may more stringently regulate the emission of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide and methane. We cannot predict the impact that such regulation may have, or that climate change may otherwise have, on our business. Future events, such as new or more stringent environmental laws and regulations, new environmental claims, the discovery of currently unknown environmental conditions requiring responsive action or more vigorous interpretations or enforcement of existing environmental laws and regulations, might require us to incur additional costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nClimate change, or legal or market measures to address climate change, may negatively affect our business and operations.\nThere is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. If any of these climate changes has a negative effect on agricultural productivity, we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products, such as milk-based, whey-based and soy-based proteins, protein blends, sweeteners and vitamin and mineral blends. In addition, increases in the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters may result in damage and disruptions to our manufacturing operations and distribution channels or our third party manufacturers\u2019 operations, particularly where a product is primarily sourced from a single location. Also, the impacts of these climate changes may cause unpredictable water availability or exacerbate water scarcity. Water is critical to our business, and the lack of available water of acceptable quality may lead to, among other things, adverse effects on our operations. The increasing concern over climate change and related environmental sustainability matters also may result in more federal, state, local and foreign legal requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases or conserve and replenish water. If such laws are enacted, we may experience significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery. Further, our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to effectively address increased concerns from the media, stockholders and other stakeholders on climate change and related environmental sustainability and governance matters. As a result, climate change could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nWe have significant debt and high leverage, which could have a negative impact on our financing options and liquidity position and which could adversely affect our business.\nWe have a significant amount of debt. As of September 30, 2020, we had $703.7 million in aggregate principal amount of total debt. Additionally, our secured revolving credit facility has a remaining borrowing capacity of $170.0 million as of September 30, 2020 (all of which would be secured when drawn).\nOur overall leverage and the terms of our financing arrangements could:\n\u2022limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures or acquisitions, to fund growth or for general corporate purposes, even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity;\n\u2022make it more difficult for us to satisfy the terms of our debt obligations;\n\u2022limit our ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us, or at all;\n\u2022limit our flexibility to plan for and to adjust to changing business and market conditions in the industries in which we operate and increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make interest and principal payments on our debt, thereby limiting the availability of our cash flow to fund future investments, capital expenditures, working capital, business activities and other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions; and\n\u2022subject us to higher levels of indebtedness than our competitors, which may cause a competitive disadvantage and may reduce our flexibility in responding to increased competition.\nOur ability to meet expenses and debt service obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, including potential changes in consumer preferences, the success of product and marketing innovation and pressure from competitors. If we do not generate enough cash to pay our debt service obligations, we may be required to refinance all or part of our debt, sell assets, borrow more money or raise additional equity capital.\nDespite our level of indebtedness, we may be able to incur substantially more debt, which could further exacerbate the risks described above, and we may in any event be required to maintain a minimum level of indebtedness.\nWe may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. Although the financing arrangements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness that may be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. These restrictions also may not prevent us from incurring certain obligations that may not constitute indebtedness under the documents governing our indebtedness.\nIn order to preserve its intended tax treatment in connection with the formation transactions that were undertaken as part of our IPO, we expect that, so long as Post has the ability to control us, Post will require that BellRing LLC maintain a minimum level of outstanding indebtedness equal to approximately $660.0 million, which takes into consideration the estimated amount of undistributed taxable income of BellRing LLC and its subsidiaries allocable to Post for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. See \u201cPost controls our Company and has the ability to control the direction of our business\u201d and \u201cPost\u2019s interests may conflict with our interests and the interests of our other stockholders. Conflicts of interest or disputes between Post and our Company could be resolved in a manner unfavorable to our Company and our other stockholders.\u201d\nThe agreements governing our debt contain various covenants that limit our ability to take certain actions and also require us to meet financial maintenance tests, and failure to comply with these covenants could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur financing arrangements contain restrictions, covenants and events of default that, among other things, require us to satisfy certain financial tests and maintain certain financial ratios and restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness and to refinance our existing indebtedness. Financing arrangements which we enter into in the future could contain similar restrictions and additionally could require us to comply with similar, new or additional financial tests or to maintain similar, new or additional financial ratios. The terms of our financing arrangements, financing arrangements which we enter into in the future and any future indebtedness may impose various restrictions and covenants on us that could limit our ability to respond to market conditions, provide for capital investment needs or take advantage of business opportunities by limiting the amount of additional borrowings we may incur. These restrictions include compliance with, or maintenance of, certain financial tests and ratios and may limit or prohibit our ability to, among other things: borrow money or guarantee debt; create liens; make investments and acquisitions; enter into, or permit to exist, contractual limits on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us; enter into new lines of business; enter into transactions with affiliates; and sell assets or merge with other companies.\nVarious risks, uncertainties and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants. Failure to comply with any of the restrictions and covenants in our existing or future financing arrangements could result in a default under those arrangements and under other arrangements that may contain cross-default provisions. A default would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of the debt under these arrangements and to foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt. Under these circumstances, we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations. In addition, the limitations imposed by financing agreements on our ability to incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing.\nOur credit agreement contains customary financial covenants, including a covenant requiring BellRing LLC to maintain a total net leverage ratio (as defined in our credit agreement) not to exceed 6.00:1.00, as measured as of the last day of each fiscal quarter.\nTo service indebtedness and fund other cash needs, we will require a significant amount of cash, and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.\nBellRing LLC\u2019s ability to pay principal and interest on its debt obligations and to fund any planned capital expenditures and other cash needs will depend in part upon the future financial and operating performance of BellRing LLC and its subsidiaries. Prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, will affect BellRing LLC\u2019s ability to make these payments.\nIf BellRing LLC is unable to make payments or we are unable to refinance our debt or obtain new financing under these circumstances, we may consider other options, including: sales of assets; sales of equity; reductions or delays of capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances; or negotiations with our lenders to restructure the applicable debt.\nOur business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, and future borrowings may not be available to us in an amount sufficient, to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We may not be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nIncreases in interest rates may negatively affect our earnings.\nAs of September 30, 2020, the aggregate principal amount of our debt instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was $703.7 million. As a result, higher interest rates will increase the cost of servicing our financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk and could materially reduce our profitability and cash flows. As of September 30, 2020, each one hundred basis points change in LIBOR rates would result in an approximate $4.0 million change in the annual cash interest expense, before any principal payment, on our financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk, including the impact of the $350.0 million in interest rate swap agreements and excluding the impact of any interest rate floors (as defined in our credit agreement).\nThe U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. Certain of our variable rate debt use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing interest rates. In addition, certain hedging transactions reference LIBOR as a benchmark rate in order to determine the applicable interest rate or payment amount. In the event LIBOR is discontinued, replaced or significantly changed, or ceases to be recognized as an acceptable benchmark, there may be uncertainty or differences in the calculation of the applicable interest rate or payment amount depending on the terms of the governing instrument. This could result in different financial performance for existing transactions, require different hedging strategies and require renegotiation for existing instruments. In addition, the transition from LIBOR could have a significant impact on the overall interest rate environment. While we do not expect the transition from LIBOR and the risks thereto to have a material adverse effect on us, it remains uncertain at this time.\nRisks Related to Our Relationship with Post\nPost controls our Company and has the ability to control the direction of our business.\nPost owns the share of our Class B Common Stock, which, for so long as Post or its affiliates (other than us) directly own more than 50% of the BellRing LLC units, represents 67% of the total voting power of both classes of our outstanding common stock.\nAs long as Post or its affiliates (other than us) owns more than 50% of the BellRing LLC units, it will be able to control nearly all corporate actions that require a stockholder vote, regardless of the vote of any other stockholder. As a result, Post has the ability to control significant matters involving us, including:\n\u2022the election and removal of our directors;\n\u2022determinations with respect to mergers, business combinations, dispositions of assets or other extraordinary corporate transactions;\n\u2022certain amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation;\n\u2022changes in capital structure, including the level of indebtedness;\n\u2022the number of shares of our Class A Common Stock available for issuance under our equity incentive plans for our prospective and existing employees; and\n\u2022agreements that may adversely affect us.\nAlternatively, if Post does not provide any requisite affirmative vote on matters requiring stockholder approval allowing us to take particular actions when requested, we will not be able to take such actions, and as a result, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected. Even if Post owns 50% or less of the BellRing LLC units, Post will have the ability to substantially influence these matters for as long as it owns a significant portion of the voting power.\nThe interests of Post may differ from our interests or those of our other stockholders and the concentration of control in Post will limit other stockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters. The concentration of ownership and voting power with Post also may delay, defer or prevent an acquisition by a third party or other change of control of our Company and may make some transactions more difficult or impossible without the support of Post, even if such events are in the best interests of our other stockholders. The concentration of voting power with Post may have an adverse effect on the price of our Class A Common Stock. Our Company may take actions that our other stockholders do not view as beneficial, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and may cause the value of an investment in us to decline.\nPost\u2019s interests may conflict with our interests and the interests of our other stockholders. Conflicts of interest or disputes between Post and our Company could be resolved in a manner unfavorable to our Company and our other stockholders.\nPost could have interests that differ from, or conflict with, the interests of our other stockholders and could cause us to take certain actions even if the actions are not favorable to us or our other stockholders or are opposed by our other stockholders. If\nPost is acquired or otherwise experiences a change in control, any acquirer or successor will be entitled to exercise Post\u2019s voting control with respect to us. Post, if it has redeemed BellRing LLC units for shares of our Class A Common Stock, generally has the right at any time to sell or otherwise dispose of the shares of our Class A Common Stock that it owns, including the ability to transfer a controlling interest in us to a third party, without the approval of any other stockholder and without providing for a purchase of any other stockholder\u2019s shares of Class A Common Stock. Post and its affiliates may also directly transfer their BellRing LLC units to third parties without the consent or approval of the Board of Managers of BellRing LLC or any other party, and in connection with such transfers, subject to certain exceptions, must either grant a written proxy to, or enter into a written voting agreement or other voting arrangement with, such transferee, which provides for the right of such transferee to direct Post or its applicable affiliate, as the holder of the share of our Class B Common Stock, to cast a number of votes to which such share of Class B Common Stock is entitled on all matters in which our stockholders generally are entitled to vote equal to the number of BellRing LLC units held by such third party in the event that Post or its applicable affiliate, as the holder of the share of our Class B Common Stock, holds in the aggregate 50% or less of the BellRing LLC units. In addition, Post may determine to distribute its beneficial retained interest in BellRing LLC by means of a spin-off to its shareholders.\nPotential conflicts of interest or disputes may arise between Post and us in a number of areas relating to our past or ongoing relationships, including:\n\u2022tax, employee benefits, indemnification and other matters arising from our IPO;\n\u2022employee retention and recruiting;\n\u2022the nature, quality and pricing of services Post has agreed to provide to us;\n\u2022business opportunities that may be attractive to both Post and us;\n\u2022sales or other disposals by Post of all or a portion of its ownership in BellRing LLC; and\n\u2022any new commercial arrangements between Post and us in the future.\nSee also potential conflicts described in \u201cOur organizational structure confers certain benefits upon Post and certain of its successors and assigns that may not benefit our Class A common stockholders to the same extent, and that could result in determinations harmful to the interests of such stockholders.\u201d\nThe resolution of any potential conflicts or disputes between Post and us may be less favorable to us than the resolution we might achieve if we were dealing with an unaffiliated third party.\nThe various ancillary agreements that we entered into with Post in connection with our IPO are of varying durations and may be amended upon agreement of the parties. The terms of these agreements were primarily determined by Post, and, therefore, may not be representative of the terms we could have obtained on a standalone basis or in negotiations with an unaffiliated third party. For as long as we are controlled by Post, we may not be able to negotiate renewals or amendments to these agreements, if required, on terms as favorable to us as those we would be able to negotiate with an unaffiliated third party.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation could prevent us from benefiting from corporate opportunities that might otherwise have been available to us.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation includes certain provisions regulating and defining the conduct of our affairs to the extent that they may involve Post and its directors, officers, employees, agents and affiliates (except that we are not deemed affiliates of Post or its affiliates for purposes of these provisions) and our rights, powers, duties and liabilities and those of our directors, officers, managers, employees and agents in connection with our relationship with Post. In general, and except as may be set forth in any agreement between us and Post, these provisions provide that Post and its affiliates may carry on and conduct any business of any kind, nature or description, whether or not such business is competitive with or in the same or similar lines of business as us; Post and its affiliates may do business with any of our customers, vendors and lessors; and Post and its affiliates may make investments in any kind of property in which we may make investments. In addition, these provisions provide that we renounce any interest or expectancy to participate in any business of Post or its affiliates.\nMoreover, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce any interests or expectancy in corporate opportunities which become known to (i) any of our directors, officers, managers, employees or agents who also are directors, officers, employees, agents or affiliates of Post or its affiliates (except that we and our subsidiaries are not deemed affiliates of Post or its affiliates for the purposes of the provision) or (ii) Post or its affiliates. Generally, neither Post nor our directors, officers, managers, employees or agents who also are directors, officers, employees, agents or affiliates of Post or its affiliates will be liable to us or our stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty solely by reason of the fact that any such person pursues or acquires any corporate opportunity for the account of Post or its affiliates, directs, recommends or transfers such corporate opportunity to Post or its affiliates or does not offer or communicate information regarding such corporate opportunity to us because such person has directed or intends to direct such opportunity to Post or one of its affiliates. This\nrenunciation does not extend to corporate opportunities expressly offered to one of our directors, officers, managers, employees or agents, solely in his or her capacity as a director, officer, manager, employee or agent of us.\nThese provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will cease to apply at such time as (i) we and Post and its affiliates are no longer affiliates of one another and (ii) none of the directors, officers, employees, agents or affiliates of Post serve as our directors, officers, managers, employees or agents. The corporate opportunity provision may exacerbate conflicts of interest between Post and us because the provision effectively permits one of our directors, officers, managers, employees or agents who also serves as a director, officer, employee, agent or affiliate of Post or its affiliates to choose to direct a corporate opportunity to Post or its affiliates instead of to us.\nIn order to preserve the ability of Post to distribute its beneficial retained interest in BellRing LLC on a tax-free basis, we may be prevented from pursuing opportunities to raise capital, to effectuate acquisitions or to provide equity incentives to our employees, which could hurt our ability to grow.\nUnder current laws, in order to effect certain tax-free distributions of its beneficial retained interest in BellRing LLC, Post may wish to ensure that the aggregate value of the BellRing LLC assets owned indirectly by the holders of our Class A Common Stock does not exceed the value of Post\u2019s beneficial retained interest in BellRing LLC. While Post has advised us that it does not have any definitive plans to undertake a tax-free distribution of its beneficial retained interest in BellRing LLC, Post may use its majority voting interest in us to retain its ability to engage in such a transaction in the future. This may cause Post to not support transactions we wish to pursue that involve issuing shares of our Class A Common Stock, including for capital raising purposes, as consideration for an acquisition or as equity incentives to our employees. The inability to pursue such transactions, if it occurs, may adversely affect our Company. See \u201cPost controls our Company and has the ability to control the direction of our business\u201d and \u201cPost\u2019s interests may conflict with our interests and the interests of our other stockholders. Conflicts of interest or disputes between Post and our Company could be resolved in a manner unfavorable to our Company and our other stockholders.\u201d\nOur agreements with Post require us to indemnify Post for certain tax liabilities.\nIn connection with our IPO, BellRing Inc. and BellRing LLC entered into a tax matters agreement with Post. Under the tax matters agreement, Post is responsible for all taxes for Post\u2019s historical active nutrition business which relate to pre-IPO periods, and BellRing LLC generally is responsible for (i) all taxes imposed with respect to any consolidated, combined or unitary tax return of Post or any of its subsidiaries that includes BellRing LLC or any of its subsidiaries to the extent such taxes relate to post-IPO periods and are attributable to BellRing LLC or any of its subsidiaries, as determined under the tax matters agreement, and (ii) all taxes that relate to post-IPO periods imposed with respect to any consolidated, combined, unitary or separate tax returns of BellRing LLC or any of its subsidiaries, as determined under the tax matters agreement. To the extent Post fails to pay taxes imposed with respect to any consolidated, combined or unitary tax return of Post or any of its subsidiaries that includes BellRing Inc. or any of its subsidiaries, the relevant taxing authority could seek to collect such taxes (including taxes for which Post is responsible under the tax matters agreement) from BellRing Inc. or its subsidiaries.\nThe tax receivable agreement with Post and BellRing LLC requires us to make cash payments to Post for certain tax benefits we may realize in the future, and these payments could be substantial.\nPost (or certain of its transferees or assignees) may redeem BellRing LLC units for, at the option of BellRing LLC (as determined by its Board of Managers), shares of our Class A Common Stock or cash pursuant to the amended and restated limited liability company agreement of BellRing LLC (the \u201cBellRing LLC Limited Liability Company Agreement\u201d). These redemptions, the formation transactions that were undertaken in connection with our IPO and certain actual or deemed distributions from BellRing LLC to Post (or certain of its transferees or assignees) or deemed sales by Post (or certain of its transferees or assignees) to BellRing Inc. or BellRing LLC of BellRing LLC units or assets, may result in increases in our pro rata share of the tax basis of BellRing LLC\u2019s assets that otherwise would not have been available. Such increases in tax basis are likely to increase (for tax purposes) depreciation and amortization deductions allocable to us and therefore reduce the amount of income tax attributable to BellRing LLC\u2019s operations we would otherwise be required to pay in the future and also may decrease gain (or increase loss) otherwise allocable to us from BellRing LLC on future dispositions of certain of BellRing LLC\u2019s assets to the extent the increased tax basis is allocated to those assets. Furthermore, under Section 704(c) of the Internal Revenue Code (the \u201cCode\u201d), we will be entitled to certain tax benefits generated by the pre-existing, contributed tax basis in BellRing LLC\u2019s assets in excess of our pro rata share of such basis at the time of the partnership\u2019s formation. The Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) may challenge all or part of these tax basis increases and tax benefits and no assurances can be made regarding the availability of these tax basis increases or other tax benefits.\nIn connection with our IPO, BellRing Inc. entered into the tax receivable agreement with Post and BellRing LLC. Under the tax receivable agreement, BellRing Inc. is required to make cash payments to Post (or certain of its transferees or other assignees) equal to 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal income tax, as well as state and local income tax and franchise tax (using an assumed tax rate on a base equal to the U.S. federal taxable income of BellRing Inc.), that we realize\n(or, in some circumstances, we are deemed to realize) as a result of (a) the increase in the tax basis of the assets of BellRing LLC attributable to (i) the redemption of BellRing LLC units by Post (or certain of its transferees or assignees) pursuant to the BellRing LLC Limited Liability Company Agreement, (ii) deemed sales by Post (or certain of its transferees or assignees) of BellRing LLC units or assets to BellRing Inc. or BellRing LLC, (iii) certain actual or deemed distributions from BellRing LLC to Post (or certain of its transferees or assignees) and (iv) certain formation transactions that were undertaken in connection with our IPO, (b) disproportionate allocations of tax benefits to BellRing Inc. as a result of Section 704(c) of the Code and (c) certain tax benefits (e.g., imputed interest, basis adjustments, deductions, etc.) attributable to payments under the tax receivable agreement. Any payments made by us under the tax receivable agreement will generally reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to us. To the extent that we are unable to make payments under the tax receivable agreement for any reason, such payments will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid. There can be no assurance that we will be able to fund or finance our obligations under the tax receivable agreement. Furthermore, our future obligation to make payments under the tax receivable agreement could make us a less attractive target for an acquisition, particularly in the case of an acquirer that cannot use some or all of the tax benefits that are subject of the tax receivable agreement. Actual tax benefits realized by us may differ from the tax benefits calculated pursuant to the terms of the tax receivable agreement, including as a result of the use of certain assumptions in the tax receivable agreement, including the use of an assumed state and local income tax rate on a base equal to the U.S. federal taxable income of BellRing Inc. to calculate tax benefits. Payments under the tax receivable agreement are not conditioned on Post\u2019s continued ownership of BellRing LLC units or our Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock. The payment obligation is a payment obligation of BellRing Inc. and not of BellRing LLC.\nPost (or its transferees or assignees) may determine to redeem any or all of its BellRing LLC units in its sole discretion and, in such event, the actual increase in tax basis and the amount and timing of any payments under the tax receivable agreement will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of any future redemptions, the price of shares of our Class A Common Stock at the time of the redemption, the nature of the assets owned by BellRing LLC at the time of the redemption, the extent to which such redemptions are taxable, the tax rates then applicable and the amount and timing of our income.\nWe will not be reimbursed for any payments made to Post under the tax receivable agreement in the event that any tax benefits are disallowed.\nPayments under the tax receivable agreement will be based on the tax reporting positions that we determine, and the IRS or another tax authority may challenge all or part of the tax basis increases, as well as other related tax positions we take, and a court could sustain any such challenge. Post (and its transferees and assignees) will not reimburse us for any payments that may previously have been made under the tax receivable agreement even if the IRS or another tax authority subsequently disallows the tax basis increase or any other relevant tax item. Instead, any excess cash payments made by us to Post (or its transferees or assignees) will be netted against any future cash payments that we might otherwise be required to make under the terms of the tax receivable agreement. However, we might not determine that we have effectively made an excess cash payment to Post (or its transferees or assignees) for a number of years following the initial time of such payment. As a result, in certain circumstances, we could make payments to Post under the tax receivable agreement in excess of our cash tax savings and become aware of that fact only at a time when there are no further payments against which to offset that excess amount.\nIn certain cases, future payments under the tax receivable agreement to Post may be accelerated or significantly exceed the actual benefits we realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the tax receivable agreement.\nThe tax receivable agreement provides that, upon a merger, asset sale or other form of business combination or certain other changes of control or if, at any time, we elect an early termination of the tax receivable agreement or materially breach any of our material obligations under the tax receivable agreement, our (or our successor\u2019s) future obligations under the tax receivable agreement would accelerate and become due and payable based on certain assumptions, including that we would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize all potential future tax benefits that are subject to the tax receivable agreement, and that, as of the effective date of the acceleration, any BellRing LLC units that Post (or its transferees or assignees) has not yet redeemed will be deemed to have been redeemed by Post (and its transferees and assignees) for an amount based on the closing trading price of our Class A Common Stock at the time of termination, even if we do not receive the corresponding tax benefits until a later date when the BellRing LLC units are actually redeemed. Such obligations under the tax receivable agreement, however, would not arise if Post distributes its beneficial retained interest in BellRing LLC by means of a spin-off to its shareholders. As a result of the foregoing, we would be required to make an immediate cash payment equal to the estimated present value as outlined in the tax receivable agreement of the anticipated future tax benefits that are the subject of the tax receivable agreement, which payment may be made significantly in advance of the actual realization, if any, of those future tax benefits and, therefore, we could be required to make payments under the tax receivable agreement that are greater than the specified percentage of the actual tax benefits we ultimately realize.\nOur organizational structure confers certain benefits upon Post and certain of its successors and assigns that may not benefit our Class A common stockholders to the same extent, and that could result in determinations harmful to the interests of such stockholders.\nOur organizational structure, including the fact that Post owns more than 50% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock and holds its economic interest in BellRing LLC directly, confers certain benefits upon Post that will not benefit the holders of our Class A Common Stock to the same extent as they will benefit Post. For example, the tax receivable agreement will provide for the payment by us to Post (or certain of its transferees or other assignees) of 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal income tax, as well as state and local income tax and franchise tax (using an assumed tax rate on a base equal to the U.S. federal taxable income of BellRing Inc.) that we realize (or, in some circumstances, we are deemed to realize) as a result of (a) the increase in the tax basis of assets of BellRing LLC attributable to (i) the redemption of BellRing LLC units by Post (or certain of its transferees or assignees) pursuant to the BellRing LLC Limited Liability Company Agreement, (ii) deemed sales by Post (or certain of its transferees or assignees) of BellRing LLC units or assets to BellRing Inc., (iii) certain actual or deemed distributions from BellRing LLC to Post (or certain of its transferees or assignees) and (iv) certain formation transactions that were undertaken in connection with our IPO, (b) disproportionate allocations of tax benefits to BellRing Inc. as a result of Section 704(c) of the Code and (c) certain tax benefits (e.g., basis adjustments, deductions, etc.) attributable to payments under the tax receivable agreement. Although we will retain 15% of the amount of such tax benefits, it is possible that the interests of Post may in some circumstances conflict with our interests and the interests of our other stockholders, including you.\nFurther, Post may have different tax positions from us, especially in light of the tax receivable agreement, that could influence its decisions regarding whether and when we should dispose of assets, whether and when we should incur new or refinance existing indebtedness and whether and when we should terminate the tax receivable agreement and accelerate our obligations thereunder. In addition, changes in tax laws, the determination of future tax reporting positions, the structuring of future transactions (including dispositions of Post\u2019s interests in BellRing LLC, such as through a tax-free spin-off to its shareholders) and related restrictions on us, and the handling of any future challenges by any taxing authority to our tax reporting positions, may take into consideration Post\u2019s tax plans and objectives or other considerations, which may differ from the considerations of us or our other stockholders. Such determination may adversely affect our profitability or prevent us from pursuing certain opportunities to grow.\nIn the event Post is acquired or otherwise experiences a change in control, any acquirer or successor will generally succeed to the rights and obligations of BellRing LLC (including under the tax receivable agreement), and the same considerations described above apply to any such successor parties.\nIf the BellRing LLC Board of Managers elects to make cash payments rather than issue shares of our Class A Common Stock in future redemptions of BellRing LLC units, such cash payments may reduce the amount of overall cash flow that would otherwise be available to us.\nSubject to the terms of the BellRing LLC Limited Liability Company Agreement, BellRing LLC units may be redeemed at any time for, at the option of BellRing LLC (as determined by its Board of Managers), (i) shares of our Class A Common Stock or (ii) cash (based on the market price of the shares of our Class A Common Stock). The redemption of BellRing LLC units for shares of Class A Common Stock will be at an initial redemption rate of one share of Class A Common Stock for one BellRing LLC unit, subject to customary redemption rate adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends and reclassifications. If cash payments are elected rather than the issuance of shares of our Class A Common Stock, such payments may require the payment of significant amounts of cash and may reduce the amount of overall cash flow that would otherwise be available for distribution to us from BellRing LLC, and also may negatively affect our ability to successfully execute our growth strategy.\nFuture sales or distributions of shares of our Class A Common Stock by Post could depress our Class A Common Stock price, impact our operations or result in a change in control of us.\nPost generally has the right at any time, if it has redeemed BellRing LLC units for shares of our Class A Common Stock, to sell or otherwise dispose of all or a portion of the shares of our Class A Common Stock that it owns to third parties. Post and its affiliates may also directly transfer their BellRing LLC units to third parties without the consent or approval of the Board of Managers of BellRing LLC or any other party. In connection with such transfers, subject to certain exceptions, Post must either grant a written proxy to, or enter into a written voting agreement or other voting arrangement with, such transferee, which, if Post or its affiliates holds in the aggregate 50% or less of the BellRing LLC units, will provide for the right of such transferee to direct Post or its applicable affiliate, as the holder of the share of our Class B Common Stock, to cast a number of votes to which such share of Class B Common Stock is entitled on all matters in which our stockholders generally are entitled to vote equal to the number of BellRing LLC units held by such third party. In addition, Post may determine to distribute its beneficial retained interest in BellRing LLC by means of a spin-off to its shareholders. A sale of a controlling interest in us to a third party would result in persons other than Post controlling us and could result in a change of management or changes in our business\noperations and policies. Sales by Post in the public market of substantial amounts of our Class A Common Stock or a spin-off to its shareholders also could depress the price of our Class A Common Stock.\nIn addition, Post has the right, subject to certain conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering the sale of its shares of our Class A Common Stock or to include its shares of our Class A Common Stock in other registration statements that we may file. In the event Post exercises its registration rights and sells all or a portion of its shares of our Class A Common Stock, the price of our Class A Common Stock could decline.\nThe services that Post provides to us may not be sufficient to meet our needs, which may result in increased costs and otherwise adversely affect our business.\nIn connection with our IPO, BellRing Inc., BellRing LLC and Post entered into a master services agreement (the \u201cMSA\u201d) pursuant to which Post provides certain services to us, such as legal, finance, internal audit, treasury, information technology, support, human resources, insurance and tax matters. Post is not obligated to provide these services in a manner that differs from the nature of the services it provided to us prior to our IPO, and thus we may not be able to modify these services in a manner desirable to us. Further, if we no longer receive these services from Post, we may not be able to perform these services ourselves or to find appropriate third party arrangements at a reasonable cost, and the cost may be higher than that charged by Post.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nWe have a limited operating history as a separate public company, and our historical financial information is not necessarily representative of the results we will achieve as a separate public company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results.\nThe historical financial information we have included in this report related to periods prior to our IPO in October 2019 does not reflect what our financial position, results of operations or cash flows would have been had we been a separate public company during those historical periods, or what our financial position, results of operations or cash flows will be in the future as a separate public company.\nWe have and will continue to incur additional expenses to create and maintain the corporate infrastructure to operate as a public company, and we have and will continue to experience increased ongoing costs in connection with being a public company.\nPrior to our IPO, our business had historically used some of Post\u2019s corporate infrastructure and services to support our business functions. The expenses related to establishing and maintaining this infrastructure had been spread across all of Post\u2019s businesses and charged to us on a cost-allocation basis. After our IPO, except as described below, we no longer have access to Post\u2019s infrastructure or services, and we have had to establish our own. The services historically provided to us by Post included finance, information technology, legal, human resources, quality, supply chain and purchasing functions. Following our IPO, we continue to receive some of these services pursuant to the MSA with Post. There can be no assurance that all of the functions provided to us by Post under the MSA will be successfully executed by Post or that we will not have to expend significant efforts or costs materially in excess of those estimated in the MSA. Any interruption in these services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, upon termination of the MSA, we will need to perform these functions ourselves or hire third parties to perform these functions on our behalf.\nIf we are unable to continue to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or our internal control over financial reporting is not effective, the reliability of our financial statements may be questioned, and the price of our Class A Common Stock could decline.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cSOX\u201d) requires any company subject to the reporting requirements of the U.S. securities laws to do a comprehensive evaluation of its and its consolidated subsidiaries\u2019 internal control over financial reporting. To comply with this statute, we are required to document and test our internal control procedures and our management is required to assess and issue a report concerning our internal control over financial reporting. At such time as we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act and qualify as an \u201caccelerated filer\u201d or \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as defined under SEC rules, our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. For these reasons, our auditors\u2019 report on internal controls is not contained in this report.\nThe rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards under the rules. During the course of its testing, our management may identify material weaknesses or significant deficiencies which may not be remedied in time to meet the deadlines imposed by SOX and SEC rules. If, at such time as each is required, our management cannot favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or our auditors identify material weaknesses in our internal controls, investor confidence in our financial results may weaken, the price of our Class A\nCommon Stock may suffer, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities. In addition, in the event we do not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we might fail to timely prevent or detect potential financial misstatements.\nActual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance.\nFrom time to time, we release guidance regarding our future performance. This guidance, which consists of forward-looking statements, is prepared by our management and is qualified by, and subject to, the assumptions and the other information contained or referred to in such release and the factors described under \u201cCautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in our current and periodic reports filed with the SEC. Our guidance is not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and neither our independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent expert or outside party has audited, reviewed, examined, compiled or applied agreed upon procedures with respect to the guidance and, accordingly, no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. The independent registered public accounting firm report included in this document relates to the Company's historical financial statements. It does not extend to any guidance and should not be read to do so.\nGuidance is based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, although presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change. We generally state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed but are not intended to represent that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges. The principal reason that we release this data is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors. We do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such persons.\nGuidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions of the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results. Accordingly, our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release. Actual results will vary from the guidance. Investors also should recognize that the reliability of any forecasted financial data diminishes the farther in the future that the data is forecast. In light of the foregoing, investors are urged to put the guidance in context and not to place undue reliance on it.\nAny failure to successfully implement our operating strategy or the occurrence of any of the risks or uncertainties set forth in this report could result in actual operating results being different than the guidance, and such differences may be adverse and material.\nThe market price and trading volume of our Class A Common Stock may be volatile.\nThe market price of our Class A Common Stock could fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including in response to the risk factors listed in this report or for reasons unrelated to our specific performance, such as reports by industry analysts, our failure to meet analysts\u2019 earnings estimates, investor perceptions, or negative developments relating to our customers, competitors or suppliers, as well as general economic and industry conditions including those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Further, our Class A Common Stock likely will not be eligible to be included in certain stock indices because of our dual class voting structure. For example, in July 2017, S&P Dow Jones stated that companies with multiple share classes will not be eligible for inclusion in the S&P Composite 1500 (comprised of the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400 and S&P SmallCap 600). Any such exclusion from indices could result in a less active trading market for our Class A Common Stock.\nA substantial portion of our total outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock may be sold into the market at any time. These sales could cause the market price of our Class A Common Stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nThe market price of our Class A Common Stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our Class A Common Stock or the perception that such sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, could make it more difficult for our stockholders to sell their shares of our Class A Common Stock at a time and price they consider appropriate, and could impair our ability to raise equity capital or use our Class A Common Stock as consideration for acquisitions of other businesses, investments or other corporate purposes.\nOur issuance of additional capital stock in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, our stock incentive plans or otherwise could dilute all other stockholders.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to 500.0 million shares of Class A Common Stock, one share of Class B Common Stock and up to 50.0 million shares of preferred stock with such rights and preferences as\nmay be determined by our Board of Directors. Subject to compliance with applicable law and various ancillary agreements we entered into with Post and its affiliates (other than us) in connection with our IPO, we may issue shares of our Class A Common Stock, or securities convertible into shares of our Class A Common Stock, from time to time in connection with a financing, an acquisition, an investment, our stock incentive plans or otherwise. We may issue additional shares of our Class A Common Stock or securities convertible into shares of our Class A Common Stock from time to time at a discount to the market price of our Class A Common Stock at the time of issuance. Any issuance of such securities could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the market price of shares of our Class A Common Stock to decline.\nWe do not expect to declare or pay any dividends on our Class A Common Stock for the foreseeable future.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our Class A Common Stock for the foreseeable future. Consequently, our stockholders must rely on sales of their shares of our Class A Common Stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment. Any future determination to pay dividends, including timing and amount, will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and subject to, among other things, our compliance with applicable law, and depend on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, level of indebtedness, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, restrictions in our debt agreements, business prospects and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. Our ability to pay dividends depends on our receipt of cash dividends from our operating subsidiaries, including BellRing LLC, and our ability to pay dividends may be further restricted as a result of the laws of our subsidiaries\u2019 jurisdictions of organization or their agreements, including agreements governing indebtedness.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and provisions of Delaware law may delay or prevent our acquisition by a third party, which might diminish the value of our Class A Common Stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain several provisions that may make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire control of us without the approval of our Board of Directors. These provisions also may delay, prevent or deter a merger, acquisition, tender offer, proxy contest or other transaction that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price for their Class A Common Stock. The provisions include, among others:\n\u2022a prohibition on actions by written consent of the stockholders once Post and its affiliates (other than us) no longer own of record more than 50% of the BellRing LLC units;\n\u2022our Board of Directors is divided into three classes with staggered terms;\n\u2022authorized but unissued shares of common stock and preferred stock that will be available for future issuance;\n\u2022the ability of our Board of Directors to fix the size of the Board of Directors and fill vacancies without a stockholder vote;\n\u2022provisions that have the same effect as a modified version of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an anti takeover law (as further described below); and\n\u2022advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations.\nSection 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may affect the ability of an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d to engage in certain business combinations, including mergers, consolidations or acquisitions of additional shares, for a period of three years following the time that the stockholder becomes an \u201cinterested stockholder.\u201d An \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d is defined to include persons owning directly or indirectly 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of a corporation. We elected in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation not to be subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Nevertheless, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains provisions that have the same effect as Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, except that they provide that Post and its various successors and affiliates (and certain transferees of any of them designated in writing by Post) are not deemed to be \u201cinterested stockholders,\u201d regardless of the percentage of our stock owned by them, and accordingly are not subject to such restrictions.\nThe provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, the significant voting power of Post and the ability of our Board of Directors to create and issue a new series of preferred stock or implement a stockholder rights plan could discourage potential takeover attempts and reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future, which could reduce the market price of our Class A Common Stock.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and our election to comply with certain reduced disclosure requirements as a public company may make our Class A Common Stock less attractive to investors.\nWe qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we are permitted and currently rely on certain provisions of the JOBS Act that contain exceptions from disclosure\nand other requirements that otherwise are applicable to companies that file periodic reports with the SEC. These JOBS Act provisions:\n\u2022permit us to include less than five years of selected financial data in this report;\n\u2022permit us to include reduced disclosure regarding our executive compensation in our SEC filings;\n\u2022provide an exemption from the independent public accountant attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;\n\u2022provide an exemption from compliance with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to our auditor\u2019s report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and our financial statements; and\n\u2022provide an exemption from the requirement to hold non-binding stockholder advisory votes on executive compensation and on golden parachute arrangements not previously approved.\nWe could be an emerging growth company for up to five years from the closing date of our IPO, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have more than $1.07 billion in annual gross revenue; (ii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which would occur if the market value of our Class A Common Stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of the prior March 31 and we have been publicly reporting for at least 12 months; or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. Some investors may find our Class A Common Stock less attractive if we rely on these provisions, which could result in a less active trading market for our Class A Common Stock and higher volatility in our stock price.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the New York Stock Exchange (the \u201cNYSE\u201d) corporate governance standards and we qualify for exemption from certain corporate governance requirements. We do not currently rely on any of these exemptions, but there can be no assurance that we will not rely on these exemptions in the future.\nSince Post owns more than 50% of the voting power of all of our outstanding common stock, we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under the NYSE corporate governance standards and are eligible to rely on exemptions from the following NYSE corporate governance requirements:\n\u2022the requirement that a majority of our Board of Directors consist of independent directors; and\n\u2022the requirement that we have compensation and nominating/corporate governance committee(s) comprised entirely of independent directors, each with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities.\nWe do not currently rely on any of these exemptions, but there can be no assurance that we will not rely on these exemptions in the future. If we were to utilize some or all of these exemptions, holders of our Class A Common Stock may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the NYSE rules regarding corporate governance.\nBellRing Inc.\u2019s only material asset is its interest in BellRing LLC, and accordingly, BellRing Inc. depends on distributions from BellRing LLC to pay taxes and expenses, including payments under the tax receivable agreement. BellRing LLC\u2019s ability to make such distributions may be subject to various limitations and restrictions.\nBellRing Inc. is a holding company, and has no material assets other than BellRing Inc.\u2019s ownership of BellRing LLC units and has no independent means of generating revenue or cash flow. BellRing LLC is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, is generally not, with the exception of certain of its subsidiaries, subject to any entity-level U.S. federal income tax. Recently enacted legislation that is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 may impute liability for adjustments to a partnership\u2019s tax return on the partnership itself in certain circumstances, absent an election to the contrary. BellRing LLC has and in the future may elect out of the application of these rules (but certain of its subsidiaries will likely not), but there can be no assurance that it will be eligible to do so in each tax year or that such election will be made. BellRing LLC (or its subsidiaries that are partnerships) may be subject to material liabilities pursuant to this legislation and related guidance if, for example, its calculations of taxable income are incorrect. Its members may be required to reimburse BellRing LLC for taxes, interest, and penalties resulting from an audit. Taxable income is allocated to holders of BellRing LLC units, including BellRing Inc. As a result, BellRing Inc. incurs U.S. federal, state and local income taxes on its allocable share of any net taxable income of BellRing LLC. Under the terms of the BellRing LLC Limited Liability Company Agreement, BellRing LLC is obligated to make tax distributions pro rata to holders of the BellRing LLC units, including, in the case of BellRing Inc., in an amount sufficient to allow BellRing Inc. to pay its tax obligations in respect of taxable income allocated to it from BellRing LLC and to make any payments required under the tax receivable agreement. In addition to tax expenses, and expenses under the tax receivable agreement, which could be significant, BellRing Inc. also incurs expenses related to its operations. We expect that BellRing LLC will make distributions pro rata to holders of the BellRing LLC units in an amount\nsufficient to allow BellRing Inc. to pay its operating expenses. In addition, the BellRing LLC Limited Liability Company Agreement provides that BellRing LLC will reimburse BellRing Inc. for any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred on behalf of BellRing Inc., including all fees, costs and expenses of BellRing Inc. associated with being a public company and maintaining its corporate existence. However, BellRing LLC\u2019s ability to make such distributions or reimbursement payments may be subject to various limitations and restrictions including, but not limited to, restrictions on distributions that would either violate any contract or agreement to which BellRing LLC is then a party, including any debt agreements, or any applicable law, or that would have the effect of rendering BellRing LLC insolvent. If BellRing LLC does not distribute sufficient funds for BellRing Inc. to pay its taxes or other liabilities, BellRing Inc. may have to borrow funds, which could adversely affect its liquidity and subject it to various restrictions imposed by any such lenders. To the extent that BellRing Inc. is unable to make payments under the tax receivable agreement for any reason, such payments will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid; except that nonpayment for a specified period may constitute a material breach of a material obligation under the tax receivable agreement and therefore accelerate payments due under the tax receivable agreement.\nGeneral Risks\nChanges in tax laws may adversely affect us, which may result in adverse effects on our financial condition or the value of our common stock.\nThere can be no assurance that future tax law changes will not increase the rate of the corporate income tax significantly; impose new limitations on deductions, credits or other tax benefits; or make other changes that may adversely affect the performance of an investment in our stock.\nWe may not be able to operate successfully if we lose key personnel, are unable to hire qualified additional personnel or experience turnover of our management team.\nWe are highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate and expand our business. If we lose key personnel or one or more members of our management team, or if we fail to attract new employees, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be harmed.\nIncreases in costs of medical and other employee health and welfare benefits may reduce our profitability.\nWith approximately 390 employees as of November 1, 2020, our profitability may be substantially affected by costs of medical and other health and welfare benefits for these employees. Although we try to control these costs, they can vary because of changes in healthcare laws and claims experience, which have the potential to increase the cost of providing medical and other employee health and welfare benefits. Any substantial increase could negatively affect our profitability.\nActions of stockholders could cause us to incur substantial costs, divert management\u2019s attention and resources and have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe may, from time to time, be subject to proposals and other requests from stockholders urging us to take certain corporate actions, including proposals seeking to influence our corporate policies or effect a change in our management. In the event of such stockholder proposals, particularly with respect to matters which our management and Board of Directors, in exercising their fiduciary duties, disagree with or have determined not to pursue, our business could be adversely affected because responding to actions and requests of stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of management and our employees. Additionally, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, business partners and customers.", "PERMNO": 18967, "SIC": 2000, "TIC": "BRBR"}
