{"cik": "54441", "company": "FURMANITE CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn evaluating the Company, the factors described below should be carefully considered. The occurrence of one or more of these events could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or the trading price of its common stock. The discussion below is focused on those risk factors management currently considers to be material. As the Company operates in a continually changing business environment, new risk factors may emerge from time to time and may become material. Additionally, the Company\u2019s past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and should not be used to anticipate future results or future period trends.\nPolitical, economic, regulatory or other conditions in the countries in which Furmanite operates could adversely affect the financial condition, results of operations or cash flow of the Company.\nOperations in foreign jurisdictions accounted for approximately 29% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014. The Company expects foreign operations to continue to be an important part of its business. Foreign and domestic operations are subject to a variety of risks, such as:\n\u2022\nrisks of economic instability;\n\u2022\npotential adverse changes in taxation policies;\n\u2022\ndisruptions from labor and political disturbances;\n\u2022\nadverse changes in tariffs or import or export restrictions; and\n\u2022\nterrorist acts, acts of war or insurrections.\nTerrorist acts, acts of war, political unrest, public health concerns, labor disputes or national disasters may disrupt our operations, as well as those of our customers. These types of acts could weaken domestic and global economies and create additional uncertainties, thus forcing our customers to reduce their capital spending, or cancel or delay projects, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition, including loss of revenue or customers.\nIn addition, as a result of the Company\u2019s global operations, it faces a variety of special United States and international legal and compliance risks. These federal, state and local laws, regulations and policies are complex, change frequently, have tended to become more stringent over time and increase our cost of doing business. These laws and regulations include environmental, health and safety regulations, data privacy requirements, international labor laws, anti-corruption and bribery laws such as the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and U.K. Bribery Act, and trade sanctions laws and regulations. In the event new laws and regulations are enacted or existing laws are amended, implementing compliance with such new or amended laws may result in a loss of revenue, increased costs of doing business and a change to Furmanite\u2019s strategic objectives, all of which could adversely affect its results of operations. In addition, the Company is subject to the risk that it, its affiliated entities or their respective officers, directors, employees and agents may take action determined to be in violation of any of these laws.\nAlthough the Company takes reasonable measures to comply with the FCPA and U.K. Bribery Act and to ensure that its employees, agents and intermediaries comply with the FCPA and U.K. Bribery Act, it cannot assure that such precautions will protect it against liability, particularly as a result of actions taken in the past, or which may be taken in the future for which the Company may have exposure under these laws. An actual or alleged violation could result in substantial fines, sanctions, civil or criminal penalties, debarment from government contracts, curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions, competitive or reputational harm, litigation or regulatory action and other consequences that might adversely affect its results of operations, financial condition, strategic objectives or cash flows.\nWeakness in the industries Furmanite serves could adversely affect demand for its services.\nA substantial portion of the business depends upon the levels of capital investment and maintenance expenditures in the refining and chemical industries, as well as the power generation and other process industries. The levels of capital and maintenance expenditures by Furmanite\u2019s customers are affected by general economic conditions, conditions in their industries and their liquidity, as well as cyclical downturns in these industries and fluctuations in oil prices. In 2014, oil prices decreased nearly 50% and have since remained depressed relative to recent historical levels. The resulting impact of the oil price decline on Furmanite\u2019s customers\nin the energy sector combined with the potential development of weaknesses in other sectors served by Furmanite could adversely affect the demand for Furmanite\u2019s services.\nChanges in the general economy affecting availability of credit may negatively impact the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations could be adversely affected during periods of economic downturn, and the timing and extent of such a decline in the global, or regional economies in which the Company operates, cannot be predicted. Lower levels of liquidity and capital adequacy affecting lenders, increases in defaults and bankruptcies by customers and suppliers, and volatility in credit and equity markets could negatively affect the Company\u2019s business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition in a number of ways, including reductions in revenues and profits, increased bad debts, and financial instability of suppliers and insurers. Furthermore, it may be more difficult or costly to access or obtain, in the future, working capital or acquisition opportunity financing.\nThe Company may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and foreign exchange restrictions.\nThe Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies, which represent a significant portion of total revenues, and certain costs, assets and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The primary foreign currencies of the Company are the Euro, British pound and Australian dollar. For the year ended December 31, 2014, foreign currency based revenues and operating income were $155.5 million and $18.8 million, respectively. Based on results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company estimates that a ten percent fluctuation of all applicable foreign currencies would result in an annual change in revenues and operating income of $14.1 million and $1.7 million, respectively.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d could result in reduced demand for the Company\u2019s services and products.\nThe adoption and implementation of any regulations which impose limiting emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from customers for whom the Company provides repair and maintenance services could adversely affect demand for the Company\u2019s services and products. Furthermore, some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other climatic events; if any such effects were to occur in regions where the Company operates, it could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s assets and operations. Moreover, it is possible that other developments, such as increasingly stringent environmental laws, regulations and enforcement policies thereunder, and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from operations of the Company, could result in costs and liabilities to the Company.\nFurmanite\u2019s services and products are offered in highly competitive markets, which limits the profit margins and the ability to increase market share.\nThe markets for Furmanite\u2019s services and products are highly competitive. Furmanite competes against large and well established national and international companies as well as regional and local companies. Furmanite also competes with the in-house maintenance departments of customers or potential customers. Competition is based on service, performance and price. If Furmanite does not compete successfully, the business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe competitive position of Furmanite depends in part on the ability to protect its intellectual property.\nThe competitive position of Furmanite depends in part upon techniques and materials that are proprietary and, in some cases, patented. The Company holds approximately 120 trademarks and patents for its techniques, products, materials and equipment. These patents are registered around the world and expire at various dates through May 2032. Although Furmanite believes it has taken appropriate steps to protect the intellectual property from misappropriation, effective protection may be unavailable or limited in some of the foreign countries. In addition, adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of trade secrets and proprietary techniques.\nThe Company is exposed to customer credit risks.\nThe Company is subject to the risk of loss resulting from delinquent payment, nonpayment or nonperformance or other obligations by its customers. If key customers default on their obligations, the financial results of the Company could be adversely affected. Furthermore, some of the Company\u2019s customers may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating and regulatory risks which may also limit their ability to pay or perform.\nUnsatisfactory safety performance can affect customer relationships, result in higher operating costs and otherwise negatively impact its business.\nThe Company\u2019s employees and others are subject to the normal hazards associated with the Company providing services at industrial facilities. Even with proper safety precautions, these hazards can lead to many negative consequences including personal injury, loss of life, destruction of property, and environmental damage. Although the Company is committed to maintaining a strong safety culture and reducing the risk of accidents to the lowest possible level, there can be no assurance these efforts will be effective. Poor safety performance may harm the Company\u2019s reputation and limit or eliminate potential revenue streams from many of its largest customers and may materially increase its future insurance and other operating costs.\nThe Company is involved and is likely to continue to be involved in legal proceedings, which if adversely determined, could have a material effect on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nThe Company is currently a defendant in various legal proceedings arising from the operations of its current and historical business and it is reasonable to expect that it will be named in future actions. Most of the legal proceedings against the Company arise out of the normal course of performing services at customer facilities, and include various types of claims including tort, contractual, workers\u2019 compensation, personal injury, property damage, business interruption and indemnification. Legal proceedings can be expensive to defend, regardless of the ultimate outcome. An unsuccessful defense of a liability claim could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nAlthough the Company maintains insurance coverage against these and other risks associated with its business, this insurance may not protect against liability from certain events. There can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s insurance will be adequate in risk coverage or policy limits to cover all losses or liabilities that it may incur. Moreover, the Company cannot assure that it will be able in the future to obtain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that it deems adequate. Any future damages that are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nFurmanite\u2019s business could be negatively affected as a result of shareholder activism, which could cause the Company to incur significant expense, hinder execution of its business strategy and impact the trading value of the Company\u2019s securities.\nShareholder activism, which could take many forms or arise in a variety of situations, has been increasing in publicly traded companies in recent years and the Company is subject to the risks associated with such activism. Shareholder activism, including potential proxy contests, requires significant time and attention by management and the Board of Directors, potentially interfering with the Company\u2019s ability to execute its strategic plan. Additionally, such shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to the Company\u2019s future direction, adversely affect its relationships with key business partners and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. Also, the Company may be required to incur significant legal fees and other expenses related to activist shareholder matters. Any of these impacts could materially and adversely affect Furmanite\u2019s business and operating results. Further, the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties described above.\nIf the Company loses any key personnel, the ability to manage the business and continue the growth of the Company could be negatively impacted.\nThe Company\u2019s success is highly dependent on the efforts of its executive officers and key employees. If any of the Company\u2019s key employees leave, its business may suffer. The growth of the Company\u2019s business is also largely dependent upon its ability to attract and retain qualified personnel in all areas of its business, including technicians and management. If the Company is unable to attract and retain such qualified personnel, it may be forced to limit growth, and its business and operating results could suffer. Organizational changes within the Company could also impact its ability to retain personnel.\nBusiness acquisitions may expose the Company to various risks.\nFrom time to time, the Company makes acquisitions of other businesses that enhance or expand its service offerings or capabilities. The Company intends to continue to pursue acquisitions that complement its existing business. Even with prudent planning, acquisitions may present unforeseen challenges, such as integration difficulties or unexpected costs. No assurances can be made that the Company will realize the level of revenues, earnings, cost savings, synergies or any other benefits that it may anticipate from an acquisition, or that it will realize such benefits within the expected time frame. If the Company is not able to address challenges that may arise with a particular acquisition, its financial performance could be adversely impacted. Further, the consideration given for acquisitions could include an assumption of liabilities, both those known and unknown. The consideration\npaid and integration efforts required in connection with an acquisition may also affect its share price or future financial results depending on many factors.", "PERMNO": 42067, "SIC": 1700, "TIC": "FRM"}
