RISK FACTORS\nOur business, operations and financial condition are subject to various risks. Some of these risks are described below, and stockholders should take such risks into account when evaluating us or any investment decision involving us. This section does not describe all risks that may be applicable to us, our industry or our business, and it is intended only as a summary of certain material risk factors. Additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know about or that we currently believe are not material may also adversely affect our business. More detailed information concerning certain of the risk factors described below is contained in other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Stockholders should also refer to the other information contained in our periodic reports, including the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements section, our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section for a further discussion of the risks, uncertainties and assumptions relating to our business.\nRisk Factors Related to Our Business\nWe have not generated a profit and consequently our business plan is difficult to evaluate and our long-term viability cannot be assured.\nOur prospects for financial success are difficult to assess because we have a limited operating history since we began reporting as a going concern on February 10, 2015. Our predecessor filed for Chapter 11 relief on November 2, 2011. We were formed and emerged from bankruptcy on September 14, 2012. Since our formation, we have generated limited revenues and had negative cash flow from operations. The development of our business plan will require substantial capital expenditures. Our business could be subject to any or all of the problems, expenses, delays and risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including, but not limited to capital resources. There can be no assurance that our business will be successful, that we will be able to achieve or maintain a profitable operation, or that we will not encounter unforeseen difficulties that may deplete our capital resources more rapidly than anticipated. There can be no assurance that we will achieve or sustain profitability or positive cash flows from our operating activities.\nWe have generated minimal revenues from operations, have limited cash resources and will be reliant on external sources of capital to fund ongoing operations.\nOur revenue generating activities have not yet produced sufficient funds for profitable operations. In addition, we are required to set aside specified minimum levels of liquidity, inclusive of cash and our line of credit, in connection with the development and financing of 77 Greenwich, which as of December 31, 2019 was $15.0 million, and we may be required to do so in connection with the development and financing of other current and future properties as well. While 77 Greenwich is currently our most significant asset, the amounts required to be set aside in other situations could also be substantial. As a result, these amounts would not be available for investment or operating activities. Our continued operation will be dependent upon the success of future operations and will require raising additional capital on acceptable terms. We have relied and may continue to rely substantially upon equity and debt financing to fund our ongoing operations. There can be no assurance that additional sources of capital will be available to us on commercially favorable terms should our capital requirements exceed cash available from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents. In addition, our inability to access the capital markets on favorable terms, because of a low stock price or otherwise, could affect our ability to execute our business plan as scheduled. If we are unable to raise capital on commercial terms, our ability to grow through new acquisitions and investments, and thus become profitable, could be materially adversely impacted.\nA significant part of our current business plan is focused on the development of 77 Greenwich, and an inability to execute this business plan due to adverse trends in the New York City residential condominium market or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business plan includes the development or redevelopment of our legacy commercial real estate properties and in particular the development of 77 Greenwich, which currently is our largest asset. As a result, our revenues and future growth are heavily dependent on the success of implementing our business plan for 77 Greenwich, which is currently under development.\nOur plans for 77 Greenwich call for 90 luxury residential condominium apartments, in addition to a retail condominium unit and a New York City elementary school condominium unit. There are a variety of factors that determine New York City residential condominium trends and that will ultimately impact the sales and pricing of units at 77 Greenwich. These factors include, among others, available supply, changes in interest rates, the availability of home mortgages, foreign exchange rates, foreign buyer patterns, local employment trends, and prices and velocity of sales. Sales of residential condominium units in general, and in particular in New York City, have historically experienced greater volatility than detached single family houses, which may expose us to more risk. These and other factors fluctuate over time. Based on a number of reports, there are a historically high number of unsold units in newly constructed luxury residential condominiums in New York City, which has resulted in demand and pricing pressures. When we commenced sales in the spring of 2019, the New York City market was in a period of softness, in particular downtown Manhattan. The status of unsold residential condominium units in 2020 and beyond is inherently uncertain. Closings on sales are currently anticipated to occur towards the end of 2020. An inability to successfully execute our business plan with respect to 77 Greenwich would likely have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur investment in property development for 77 Greenwich and other properties may be more costly than anticipated.\nWe intend to continue to develop or redevelop our current and future properties. Our current and future development and construction activities, including with respect to 77 Greenwich, may be exposed to the following risks:\n\u00b7 we may be unable to proceed with the development of properties other than 77 Greenwich because we cannot obtain financing on favorable terms, or at all;\n\u00b7 we may incur construction costs for a development project that exceed our original estimates due to increases in interest rates and increased materials, labor, leasing or other costs, which could make completion of the project less profitable because market rents or condominium unit sales prices, as applicable, may not increase sufficiently to compensate for the increase in construction costs;\n\u00b7 we may be unable to obtain, or face delays in obtaining, required zoning, land-use, building, occupancy, and other governmental permits and authorizations, which could result in increased costs and could require us to abandon our activities entirely with respect to a project;\n\u00b7 we may abandon development opportunities after we begin to explore them and as a result we may lose deposits or fail to recover expenses already incurred;\n\u00b7 we may expend funds on and devote management\u2019s time to projects which we do not complete;\n\u00b7 we may be unable to complete construction and/or leasing of our rental properties and sales of our condominium projects (currently limited to 77 Greenwich) on schedule, or at all; and\n\u00b7 we may suspend development projects after construction has begun due to changes in economic conditions or other factors, and this may result in the write-off of costs, payment of additional costs or increases in overall costs when the development project is restarted.\nInvestment returns from 77 Greenwich and other properties we may develop may be less than anticipated.\nOur properties planned to be developed may be exposed to the following risks:\n\u00b7 we may sell condominium units at 77 Greenwich and other future developed properties at prices, and/or lease commercial and residential properties at current or future properties, that are less than the prices projected at the time we decide to undertake the development;\n\u00b7 the velocity of leasing at commercial and residential properties, and/or condominium sales at future developed properties may fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, and may result in our investments being less profitable than we expected or not profitable at all; and\n\u00b7 operating expenses may be greater than projected at the time of development, resulting in our investment being less profitable than we expected.\nCompetition for new acquisitions and investments may reduce the number of opportunities available to us and increase the costs of those acquisitions and investments.\nWe will face competition for acquisition and investment opportunities from other investors, particularly those investors who are willing to incur more leverage. This competition may adversely affect us by subjecting us to the following risks:\n\u00b7 an inability to acquire a desired property because of competition from other well-capitalized real estate investors, many of whom have greater resources than us, including publicly traded and privately held REITs, private real estate funds, domestic and foreign financial institutions, life insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, pension trusts, partnerships and individual investors; and\n\u00b7 an increase in the purchase price for the acquisition of such property.\nIf we are unable to successfully acquire or invest in additional properties, our ability to grow our business would be adversely affected. In addition, increases in the cost of acquisition opportunities could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe face risks associated with acquisitions of and investments in new properties.\nWe may acquire interests in properties, individual properties and portfolios of properties, including potentially large portfolios that could significantly increase our size and alter our capital structure. Our acquisition and investment activities may be exposed to, and their success may be adversely affected by, the following risks:\n\u00b7 we may be unable to finance acquisitions, investments and developments of properties, including with respect to raising capital to contribute as equity, on favorable terms or at all;\n\u00b7 we may be unable to complete proposed acquisitions or other transactions due to an inability to meet required closing conditions;\n\u00b7 we may expend funds on, and devote management time to, opportunities which we do not complete, which may include non-refundable deposits;\n\u00b7 we may be unable to lease our acquired properties on the same terms as contemplated as part of our underwriting;\n\u00b7 properties that we acquire or in which we invest may fail to perform as we expected;\n\u00b7 our estimates of the costs we incur in renovating, improving, developing or redeveloping acquired properties may be inaccurate;\n\u00b7 we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage for acquired properties; and\n\u00b7 we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, investments and developments, particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties, into our existing operations, and therefore our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe may acquire properties subject to known and unknown liabilities and with limited or no recourse to the seller.\nProperties we acquire may be subject to known or unknown liabilities with no or minimal recourse to the seller. As a result, if a property is damaged, we may need to pay to have it repaired, and our ability to recover any such payments through insurance, indemnities, litigation or otherwise is uncertain. We have purchased one property subject to unknown construction defects and there can be no assurance that we will not do so again. Also, if a liability were asserted against us arising from our ownership of a property, we might have to pay substantial sums to settle it. Unknown liabilities with respect to properties acquired might include:\n\u00b7 liabilities for repair of damaged properties or faulty construction;\n\u00b7 claims by tenants, vendors or other persons arising from dealing with the former owners of the properties;\n\u00b7 liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business;\n\u00b7 claims for indemnification by general partners, directors, officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties; and\n\u00b7 liabilities for clean-up of undisclosed environmental contamination and/or repair or other remediation of construction defects.\nAny of these occurrences could adversely affect our cash flow, even if some or all of the costs are ultimately borne by a third party, and the impact could be material.\nOur revenues and the value of our portfolio are affected by a number of factors that affect investments in leased commercial and residential real estate generally.\nWe are subject to the general risks of investing in and owning leasable real estate in connection with our existing retail and residential properties and new properties or investments in leasable real estate. These risks include the ability to secure leases with new tenants, renew leases with existing tenants, the non-performance of lease obligations by tenants, leasehold improvements that will be costly or difficult to remove or certain upgrades that may be needed should it become necessary to re-rent the leased space for other uses, rights of termination of leases due to events of casualty or condemnation affecting the leased space or the property or due to interruption of the tenant\u2019s quiet enjoyment of the leased premises, and obligations of a landlord to restore the leased premises or the property following events of casualty or condemnation. The occurrence of any of these events, particularly with respect to leases at our commercial real estate properties, or issues that affect numerous residential units, could adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nIn addition, if our competitors offer space at net effective rental rates below our current net effective rates or the market rates, we may lose current or potential tenants to other properties in our markets. Additionally, we may need to reduce net effective rental rates below our current rates or offer incentives in order to retain tenants upon expiration of their leases or to attract new tenants. Our results of operations and cash flow may be adversely affected as a result of these factors.\nWe may be unable to lease vacant space, renew our current leases, or re-lease space as our current leases expire.\nLeases at our properties may not be renewed or such properties may not be re-leased at favorable rental rates. If the rental rates for our properties decrease, our tenants do not renew their leases or we do not re-lease a significant portion of our available space, including vacant space resulting from tenant defaults or space that is currently unoccupied, and space for which leases are scheduled to expire, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. There are numerous commercial developers, real estate companies, financial institutions and other investors with greater financial resources than we have that compete with us in seeking tenants who we desire to lease space in our properties.\nThe bankruptcy of, or a downturn in the business of, any of the major tenants at our commercial real estate properties that causes them to reject their leases, or to not renew their leases as they expire, or renew at lower rental rates, may adversely affect our cash flows and property values. In addition, retailers at our properties face increasing competition from e-commerce, outlet malls, discount shopping clubs, direct mail and telemarketing, which could reduce rents payable to us and reduce our ability to attract and retain tenants at our properties leading to increased vacancy rates at our properties.\nIn addition, if we are unable to renew leases or re-lease a property, the resale value of that property could be diminished because the market value of a particular property will depend in part upon the value of the leases of such property.\nWe are subject to the risks associated with joint ventures.\nWe formed joint ventures with third parties to acquire and operate The Berkley and the 250 North 10th Street property, both in Brooklyn, New York. We may become involved in additional joint ventures in the future with respect to current or future properties. Joint venture investments may involve risks not otherwise present for investments made or owned solely by us, including the possibility that our joint venture partner might become bankrupt, or may take action contrary to our instructions, requests, policies or objectives. Other risks of joint venture investments include impasse on decisions, such as a sale, because neither we nor a joint venture partner would have full control over the joint venture, activities conducted by a partner that have a negative impact on the joint venture or us, and disputes with our partner. Also, although our debt documents contain certain restrictions, there is no limitation under our organizational documents as to the amount of our funds that may be invested in joint ventures.\nWe are subject to leverage at both our holding company and our subsidiaries and face risks generally associated with our debt, including an increased risk of default on our obligations and an increase in debt service requirements that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations\nWe have incurred substantial indebtedness in furtherance of our activities, at both the holding company level and subsidiary level, resulting in an increased risk of default on our obligations and in an increase in debt service requirements, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. As a result, we are subject to the risks associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest, the risk that we may fail to repay or refinance existing debt as it matures, which may result in forced disposition of assets on disadvantageous terms or have other adverse consequences, and the risk that if we refinance any of our debt, we may do so on refinancing terms less favorable than the terms of our existing debt.\nAll of our properties secure loans. The failure by our borrower subsidiaries to make scheduled repayments under the loan agreements, or the default of any of the obligations under the loans, would have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the applicable subsidiary may be required to immediately repay all amounts outstanding under the respective loan and the lenders may exercise other remedies available to them, including foreclosing on the respective property securing the loan.\nSee Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources and Note 10 - Loans Payable and Secured Line of Credit to our consolidated financial statements, for further discussion regarding our financing activities.\nCovenants in our loan agreements could limit our flexibility and adversely affect our financial condition.\nThe terms of our loan documents contain a number of financial and other restrictive covenants, including restrictions on debt, liens, business activities, equity repurchases, distributions and dividends, disposition of assets and transactions with affiliates, as well as financial covenants regarding corporate loan to value, net worth and liquidity. These covenants may limit our flexibility to pursue certain acquisitions or investments or incur additional debt. If we fail to meet or satisfy any of these covenants, we would be in default under these agreements and our indebtedness could be declared due and payable. In addition, our lenders could terminate their commitments, require the posting of additional collateral and enforce their interests against existing collateral. If we were to default under our loan agreements, our financial condition would be adversely affected.\nThe potential phasing out of LIBOR after 2021 may affect our financial results.\nThe chief executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\"), which regulates LIBOR, has announced that the FCA intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes or the establishment of alternative reference rates.\nThe Alternative Reference Rate Committee (\"ARRC\"), a committee convened by the Federal Reserve that includes major market participants, and on which the SEC staff and other regulators participate, has proposed an alternative rate, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d), to replace U.S. Dollar LIBOR. Any changes announced by the FCA, ARRC, other regulators or any other successor governance or oversight body, or future changes adopted by such body, in the method pursuant to which U.S. Dollar LIBOR, SOFR, or any other alternative rates are determined may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in the reported LIBOR rates. If that were to occur, the levels of interest payments we incur and interest payments we receive may change. It is also uncertain whether SOFR or any other alternative rate will gain market acceptance. In addition, although certain of our LIBOR based obligations and investments provide for alternative methods of calculating the interest rate if LIBOR is not reported, uncertainty as to the extent and manner of future changes may result in interest rates and/or payments that are higher than, lower than or that do not otherwise correlate over time with the interest rates and/or payments that would have been made on our obligations if LIBOR rate was available in its current form. We may also need to renegotiate our LIBOR based obligations, which we may not be successful in doing on a timely basis or on terms acceptable to us.\nWe may not receive or be able to maintain certain tax benefits if we are not in compliance with certain requirements of the NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development.\nWe may not receive or be able to maintain certain existing or anticipated tax benefits related to The Berkley, 237 11th and 250 North 10th Street properties if we are not in compliance with certain requirements of the NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development (the \u201cHPD\u201d). Both of these properties currently benefit from a real estate tax exemption under New York Real Property Tax Law (the \u201cRPTL\u201d) Section 421a, as a result of a specified percentage of the units in such buildings being designated as affordable rate units or market rate units and/or subject to rent stabilization guidelines, among other requirements. Section 421a of the New York RPTL provides an exemption from real estate taxes on the amount of the assessed value of newly constructed improvements if certain requirements are met. A property cannot maintain or continue to receive Section 421a tax benefits without HPD\u2019s determination that all Section 421a eligibility requirements have and continue to be met. Although the HPD has issued a final Certificate of Eligibility with respect to the 421a tax benefits for The Berkley, 237 11th and 250 North 10th Street properties and we are currently in compliance with all applicable 421a requirements for such properties, there can be no assurance that compliance with the 421a requirements for either of the properties will continue to be maintained. If we are not able to maintain compliance with the requirements of the Section 421a partial tax exemption program, as applicable to either of the properties, the HPD may find that such property is ineligible to receive the tax exemption benefits related to the Section 421a partial tax exemption program.\nMulti-family residential properties are subject to rent stabilization regulations, which limit our ability to raise rents above specified maximum amounts and could give rise to claims by tenants that their rents exceed such specified maximum amounts.\nThe Rent Stabilization Law and Code imposes rent control or rent stabilization on apartment buildings. The rent stabilization regulations applicable to our multi-family residential properties set maximum rates for annual rent increases, entitle our tenants to receive required services from us and entitle our tenants to have their leases renewed. The limitations established by present or future rent stabilization regulations may impair our ability to maintain rents at market levels.\nPursuant to the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019, which is a set of New York State laws, vacancy lease increases were eliminated, whereby the landlord was permitted to increase the rent by as much as 20% for a tenant moving into a vacant apartment, to which significant increases in rent for New York City properties were historically attributed.\nWith respect to certain types of properties in New York City, solely by virtue of the real estate tax exemption under RPTL Section 421a, the Rent Guidelines Board of New York City, approves renewal lease rent increases. In each of 2018 and 2019, the Rent Guidelines Board approved a 1.5% increase on 12-month lease renewals and a 2.5% increase on 24-month lease renewals. Approved rent increases have averaged approximately 2.6% over the past 24 years on 12-month lease renewals and approximately 0.85% over the past 5 years on 12-month lease renewals.\nThe application of rent stabilization to apartments in our multi-family residential properties will limit the amount of rent we are able to collect, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to fully take advantage of the investments that we are making in our properties. In addition, there can be no assurances that changes to rent stabilization laws will not have a similar or greater negative impact on our ability to collect rents.\nThere is a proposed Bill (Good Cause Eviction), which, if passed may impose restrictions on rent increases and the right not to renew market rate unit leases. If passed, there will be restrictions on an owner\u2019s ability to grow their market rents.\nOur ability to develop or redevelop our properties and enter into new leases with tenants will depend on our obtaining certain permits, site plan approvals and other governmental approvals from local municipalities, which we may not be able to obtain on a timely basis or at all.\nIn order to develop or redevelop our properties, we will be required to obtain certain permits, site plan approvals or other governmental approvals from local municipalities. We may not be able to secure all the necessary permits or approvals on a timely basis or at all, which may prevent us from developing or redeveloping our properties according to our business plan. Additionally, potential acquirers or tenants may also need to obtain certain permits or approvals in order to utilize our properties in the manner they intend to do so. The specific permit and approval requirements are set by the state and the various local jurisdictions, including but not limited to city, town, county, township and state agencies having control over the specific properties. Our inability to obtain permits and approvals to develop or redevelop our properties, or the inability of potential purchasers and tenants of our properties to obtain necessary permits and approvals, could severely and adversely affect our business.\nWe may incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and environmental contamination may impair our ability to lease and/or sell real estate.\nOur operations and properties are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the protection of the environment, including air and water quality, hazardous or toxic substances and health and safety. Under some environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances released at a property. The owner or operator may also be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage or personal injuries and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by those parties because of the contamination. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of the release of the substances or caused the release. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may impair our ability to sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral. Other laws and regulations govern indoor and outdoor air quality including those that can require the abatement or removal of asbestos-containing materials in the event of damage, demolition, renovation or remodeling and also govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air. The maintenance and removal of lead paint and certain electrical equipment containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are also regulated by federal and state laws. We are also subject to risks associated with human exposure to chemical or biological contaminants such as molds, pollens, viruses and bacteria which, above certain levels, can be alleged to be connected to allergic or other health effects and symptoms in susceptible individuals. We could incur fines for environmental compliance and be held liable for the costs of remedial action with respect to the foregoing regulated substances or related claims arising out of environmental contamination or human exposure to contamination at or from our properties.\nEach of our properties has been subject to varying degrees of environmental assessment. To date, these environmental assessments have not revealed any environmental condition material to our business. However, identification of new compliance concerns or undiscovered areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, human exposure to contamination or changes in clean-up or compliance requirements could result in significant costs to us.\nCompliance or failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act or other safety regulations and requirements could result in substantial costs.\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d) generally requires that public buildings, including our properties, meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. These rules are subject to interpretation and change. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the federal government or the award of damages to private litigants and/or legal fees to their counsel. If, under the ADA, we are required to make substantial alterations and capital expenditures in one or more of our operating properties, including the removal of access barriers, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could incur fines or private damage awards. We do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether compliance with future requirements will require significant unanticipated expenditures that will affect our cash flow and results of operations.\nThe loss of key personnel upon whom we depend to operate our business or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel could adversely affect our business.\nWe believe that our future success will depend in large part on our ability to retain or attract highly qualified and experienced management and other personnel, including in particular our President and Chief Executive Officer, Matthew Messinger. We may not be successful in retaining key personnel or in attracting other highly qualified personnel. Any inability to retain or attract qualified management and other personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur ability to utilize our NOLs to reduce future tax payments may be limited as a result of future transactions.\nWe had approximately $241.5 million of federal NOLs at December 31, 2019. Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, or the Code, contains rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an ownership change, which is generally any change in ownership by certain stockholders of more than 50% of its stock over a three-year period, to utilize its NOLs after the ownership change. These rules generally operate by focusing on ownership changes involving stockholders who directly or indirectly own 5% or more of the stock of a company and any change in ownership arising from a new issuance of stock. Generally, if an ownership change occurs, the annual taxable income limitation on our use of NOLs is equal to the product of the applicable long term tax exempt rate and the value of our stock immediately before the ownership change. If we experience an ownership change, our ability to utilize our NOLs would be subject to significant limitations. In addition, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTCJA\u201d) limits the deductibility of NOLs arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 to 80 percent of taxable income (computed without regard to the net operating loss deduction) for the taxable year.\nPolitical and economic uncertainty, and developments related to outbreaks of contagious diseases, could have an adverse effect on us.\nWe cannot predict how current political and economic uncertainty, including uncertainty related to taxation and increases in interest rates, will affect our critical tenants, joint venture partners, lenders, financial institutions and general economic conditions, including consumer confidence and the volatility of the stock market and real estate market. In addition, we cannot predict the impact of the outbreak of contagious diseases, such as COVID-19, which is rapidly evolving and has had, and is likely to continue to have, an impact on the stock market, debt markets and real estate markets, among other impacts.\nThese issues pose a risk to us in that they may cause consumers to postpone discretionary spending in response to tighter credit, reduced consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors affecting consumer spending behavior, resulting in a downturn in the business of our tenants and an impact on potential purchases of our condominium units. In the event current political and economic uncertainty results in financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets or significant financial service institution failures, there could be a new or incremental tightening in the credit markets, low liquidity, and extreme volatility in fixed income, credit, currency and equity markets. Each of these could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nBreaches of information technology systems could materially harm our business and reputation.\nWe collect and retain on information technology systems certain financial, personal and other sensitive information provided by third parties, including tenants, vendors and employees. We also rely on information technology systems for the collection and distribution of funds.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information or the unauthorized distribution of funds. Any loss of this information or unauthorized distribution of funds as a result of a breach of information technology systems may result in loss of funds to which we are entitled, legal liability and costs (including damages and penalties), as well as damage to our reputation, that could materially and adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur common stock is thinly traded and the price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly.\nOur common stock, listed on the NYSE American, is thinly traded. We cannot assure stockholders that an active market for our common stock will develop in the foreseeable future or, if developed, that it will be sustained. As a result stockholders may not be able to resell their common stock. Because our common stock is thinly traded, even small trades can have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock, as was the case in 2018 and 2019 when our stock price decreased significantly on low volume. For instance, our stock price has ranged from a high of $7.45 per share in May 2018, to a low of $2.81 per share in December 2019 even though we believe we have executed our business plan and significantly de-risked our development of 77 Greenwich. Volatility in the market price of our common stock and lack of liquidity may prevent stockholders from being able to sell their shares at or above the price paid for such shares. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for various reasons, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u00b7 changes in the real estate markets in which we operate;\n\u00b7 our ability to develop or redevelop or successfully sell units in 77 Greenwich or at other properties in the future;\n\u00b7 our ability to identify new acquisition and investment opportunities and/or close on those acquisitions or investments;\n\u00b7 the potential issuance of additional shares of common stock including at prices that are below the then-current trading price of our common stock;\n\u00b7 volatility in global and/or U.S. equities markets;\n\u00b7 our financial results or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u00b7 the public\u2019s reaction to our press releases and other public announcements and our filings with the SEC;\n\u00b7 new laws or regulations or new interpretations of laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u00b7 changes in general conditions in the United States and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to such events;\n\u00b7 sales of common stock by our executive officers, directors and significant stockholders;\n\u00b7 changes in generally accepted accounting principles, policies, guidance, or interpretations; and\n\u00b7 other factors described in our filings with the SEC, including among others in connection with the risks noted in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn addition, until our common stock is more widely held and actively traded, small sales or purchases may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate dramatically up or down without regard to our financial health or business prospects. Downward fluctuations can impair, and have impaired, our ability to raise equity capital on acceptable terms.\nStockholders may experience dilution of their ownership interests upon the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or securities convertible into shares of our common stock.\nWe may issue additional equity securities in capital raising transactions or otherwise, resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of our present stockholders. We are currently authorized to issue an aggregate of 120,000,000 shares of capital stock consisting of 79,999,997 shares of common stock, two shares of a class of preferred stock (which were redeemed in accordance with their terms and may not be reissued), one share of a class of special stock and 40,000,000 shares of blank check preferred stock. As of December 31, 2019, there were 31,881,961 shares of our common stock and one share of special stock outstanding, as well as warrants to purchase 7,179,000 shares of our common stock.\nWe have in the past and we may in the future raise additional capital through public or private offerings of our common stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for our common stock. Any future issuance of our equity or equity-linked securities may dilute then-current stockholders\u2019 ownership percentages and could also result in a decrease in the fair market value of our equity securities, because our assets would be owned by a larger pool of outstanding equity. We may also issue such securities in connection with hiring or retaining employees and consultants, as payment to providers of goods and services, in connection with future acquisitions and investments, development, redevelopment and repositioning of assets, or for other business purposes. Our board of directors may at any time authorize the issuance of additional common stock without stockholder approval, unless the approval of our common stockholders is required by applicable law, rule or regulation, including NYSE American regulations, or our certificate of incorporation. The terms of preferred or other equity or equity-linked securities we may issue in future transactions may be more favorable to new investors, and may include dividend and/or liquidation preferences, anti-dilution protection, pre-emptive rights, superior voting rights and the issuance of warrants or other derivative securities, among other terms, which may have a further dilutive effect. Our outstanding warrants also contain these types of provisions. Also, the future issuance of any such additional shares of common stock or other securities may create downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock. There can be no assurance that any such future issuances will not be at a price or have conversion or exercise prices below the price at which shares of the common stock are then traded.\nA decline in the price of our common stock, including as a result of a sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, may impair our ability to raise capital in the future.\nA decline in the price of our common stock, whether as a result of market conditions, sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, or other reasons, such as has occurred since mid-2018, may make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate, which would impair our ability to raise capital.\nCapital-raising transactions resulting in a large amount of newly issued shares that become readily tradable, or other events that cause current stockholders to sell shares, could place downward pressure on the trading price of our stock. In addition, the lack of a robust resale market may require a stockholder who desires to sell a large number of shares of common stock to sell the shares in increments over time to mitigate any adverse impact of the sales on the market price of our stock.\nIf our stockholders sell, or the market perceives that our stockholders intend to sell for various reasons, including the ending of restrictions on resale of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, including shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options, the market price of our common stock could fall. A significant amount of restricted shares previously issued by us have been registered for resale on registration statements filed with the SEC.\nMore than 50% of our shares of common stock are currently controlled by four of our stockholders who may have the ability to influence the election of directors and the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders.\nMore than 50% of our shares of common stock are controlled by four of our stockholders. As a result, these stockholders may have the ability to significantly influence the outcome of issues submitted to our stockholders for a vote. The interests of these stockholders may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders, and they may act in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders. The concentration of ownership could also deter unsolicited takeovers, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices.\nThe holder of our special stock and one of our lenders each have the right to appoint a member to our board of directors and, consequently, the ability to exert influence over us.\nIn connection with the investment in us by Third Avenue Trust, on behalf of Third Avenue Real Estate Value Fund (\u201cThird Avenue\u201d), a beneficial holder of 17.7% of our common stock at December 31, 2019, Third Avenue was issued one share of a class of special stock and our certificate of incorporation was amended to provide that, subject to the other terms and conditions of our certificate of incorporation, from the issuance of the one share of special stock and until the \u201cSpecial Stock Ownership Threshold\u201d of 2,345,000 shares of common stock is no longer satisfied, Third Avenue has the right to elect one director to the board of directors. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement and letter agreement we entered into in December 2019 with the lender under our corporat credit facility (the \u201cLender\u201d), the Lender has the right to elect one director to the board of directors, or, at the election of the Lender, a board observer may be selected in lieu of a board member, so long as certain conditions are met as described in more detail in Note 10 - Loans Payable and Secured Line of Credit and Note 11 - Stockholders\u2019 Equity. As a result, for so long as these board appointment rights are in effect, Third Avenue and the Lender may be able to exert influence over our policies and management, potentially in a manner which may not be in our best interests or the best interests of the other stockholders.\nIn order to protect our ability to utilize our NOLs and certain other tax attributes, our certificate of incorporation includes certain transfer restrictions with respect to our stock, which may limit the liquidity of our common stock.\nTo reduce the risk of a potential adverse effect on our ability to use our NOLs and certain other tax attributes for U.S. Federal income tax purposes, our certificate of incorporation contains certain transfer restrictions with respect to our stock by substantial stockholders. These restrictions may adversely affect the ability of certain holders of our common stock to dispose of or acquire shares of our common stock and may have an adverse impact on the liquidity of our stock generally.\nWe have not paid dividends on our common stock in the past and do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any return on investment may be limited to the value of our common stock.\nNo cash dividends have been paid on our common stock. We expect that any income received from operations will be devoted to our future operations and growth. We do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the near future. Payment of dividends in the future will depend upon our profitability at the time, cash available for those dividends, and such other factors as our board of directors may consider relevant. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because a return on an investor\u2019s investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates.\nOur charter documents and Delaware law could prevent a takeover that stockholders consider favorable and could also reduce the market price of our stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of us. These provisions could also make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. In addition to the matters identified in the risk factors above relating to the provisions of our certificate of incorporation, these provisions include:\n\u00b7 a classified board of directors with two-year staggered terms;\n\u00b7 limitations in our certificate of incorporation on acquisitions and dispositions of our common stock designed to protect our NOLs and certain other tax attributes; and\n\u00b7 authorization for blank check preferred stock, which could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock.\nThese and other provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and under Delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts, reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of common stock and result in the market price of the common stock being lower than it would be without these provisions.\nOur certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain actions or proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could discourage claims or limit shareholders\u2019 ability to make a claim against the Company, our directors, officers, and employees.\nThe Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on the Company\u2019s behalf; any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty; any action asserting a claim against the Company arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation or bylaws; or any action asserting a claim against the Company that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This provision is not intended to apply to claims arising under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. To the extent the provision could be construed to apply to such claims, there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce the provision in such respect, and the Company\u2019s stockholders will not be deemed to have waived the Company\u2019s compliance with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nThe exclusive forum provision may discourage claims or limit shareholders\u2019 ability to submit claims in a judicial forum that they find favorable and may create additional costs as a result. If a court were to determine the exclusive forum provision to be inapplicable and unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs in conjunction with our efforts to resolve the dispute in an alternative jurisdiction, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nBecause we are a U.S. real property holding corporation, non-U.S. holders of our common stock could be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the gain from its sale, exchange or other disposition.\nBecause we are a U.S. real property holding corporation, which we refer to as \"USRPHC,\" under the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980 and applicable United States Treasury regulations, which we refer to collectively as the \"FIRPTA Rules,\" unless an exception applies, certain non-U.S. investors in our common stock could be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the gain from the sale, exchange or other disposition of shares of our common stock, and such non-U.S. investors could be required to file a United States federal income tax return. In addition, the purchaser of such common stock may be required to withhold 15% of the purchase price and remit such amount to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.\nUnder the FIRPTA Rules, we are a USRPHC because our interests in U.S. real property comprise at least 50% of the fair market value of our assets. Our common stock trades on the NYSE American. So long as it continues to do so, and is regularly quoted by brokers or dealers making a market in our common stock, our common stock will be treated as \"regularly traded on an established securities market\" (within the meaning of the FIRPTA Rules). As a result, (i) a non-U.S. investor who, actually or constructively, holds or held no more than 5% of our common stock would not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the gain from the sale, exchange or other disposition of our common stock under the FIRPTA Rules, and (ii) a purchaser of such stock from a non-U.S. investor would not be required to withhold any portion of the purchase price of such stock, regardless of the percentage of our common stock held by such non-U.S. investor. Any of our common stockholders that are non-U.S. persons should consult their tax advisors to determine the consequences of investing in our common stock.\nForward-looking statements may prove inaccurate.\nSee Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\" for additional disclosure regarding forward-looking statements.", "PERMNO": 65429, "SIC": 6512, "TIC": "TPHS"}
