{"cik": "106618", "company": "HANDY & HARMAN LTD.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nThis report includes \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (\"Securities Act\"), and Section 21E of the Exchange Act, including, in particular, forward-looking statements under the headings \"Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and \"Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\" These statements appear in a number of places in this report and include statements regarding the Company's intent, belief or current expectations, such as those relating to future business, future results of operations or financial condition, new or planned products or services, or management strategies, including those with respect to (i) the Company's financing plans, (ii) trends affecting its financial condition or results of operations and (iii) the impact of competition. The words \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"believe,\" \"seek,\" \"estimate\" and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements; however, this report also contains other forward-looking statements in addition to historical information.\nThese forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, among others, those discussed in \"Item 1A - Risk Factors\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as in our consolidated financial statements, related notes, and the other information appearing elsewhere in this report and our other filings with the SEC. We do not intend, and undertake no obligation, to update any of our forward-looking statements after the date of this report to reflect actual results or future events or circumstances. Given these risks and uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.\nFactors that could cause the actual results of the Company in future periods to differ materially include, but are not limited to, the following:\nRisks Relating to Our Financial Condition\nHNH sponsors a defined benefit pension plan, which could subject it to substantial cash funding requirements in the future.\nHNH's ongoing operating cash flow requirements include arranging for the funding of the minimum requirements of the WHX Corporation Pension Plan (\"WHX Pension Plan\"). The performance of the financial markets and interest rates, as well as health care trends and associated mortality rates, impact our defined benefit pension plan expense and funding obligations. Significant changes in these factors, including adverse changes in discount rates, investment losses on plan assets and increases in participant life expectancy, may increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our financial condition. HNH expects to have required minimum pension plan contributions to the WHX Pension Plan for 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and for the five years thereafter of $17.1 million, $13.9 million, $14.8 million, $17.0 million, $18.6 million and $59.5 million, respectively. Such required future contributions are determined based upon assumptions regarding such matters as discount rates on future obligations, assumed rates of return on plan assets and legislative changes. Actual future pension costs and required funding obligations will be affected by changes in the factors and assumptions described above, as well as other changes such as any plan termination or other acceleration events.\nHNH has ongoing requirements to fund its pension plan obligations and meet other administrative expenses. However, H&H Group's debt facilities contain covenants that limit HNH's access to cash. If HNH is unable to access funds generated by its subsidiaries, it may not be able to meet its financial obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2014, HNH, the parent company, had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $22.1 million and current liabilities of approximately $0.4 million. Because HNH is a holding company that conducts operations through its subsidiaries, it depends on those entities for dividends, distributions and other payments to generate the funds necessary to meet\nPage | 5\nits financial obligations. H&H Group's credit facilities restrict H&H Group's ability to transfer any cash or other assets to HNH, subject to certain exceptions including required pension payments to the WHX Pension Plan. These exceptions are subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and financial covenants. Failure by one or more of those subsidiaries to generate sufficient cash flow or meet the requirements of H&H Group's credit facilities, restricting future dividends or distributions to HNH, could have a material adverse effect on HNH's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nHNH holds a significant investment in the common stock of another public company, and fluctuations in the value of this investment may adversely impact the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nHNH owned 6,383,005 and 5,941,170 shares of the common stock of ModusLink Global Solutions, Inc. (\"ModusLink\") at December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively, and has elected the option to value its investment in ModusLink using fair value, calculated based on the closing market price for ModusLink common stock. The value of this investment decreased from $34.0 million at December 31, 2013 to $23.9 million at December 31, 2014 due primarily to changes in the share price of ModusLink's common stock. ModusLink primarily provides supply chain and logistics services to companies in consumer electronics, communications, computing, software, storage and retail. Fluctuations in the price of ModusLink common stock are subject to market fluctuations and other factors, which are not directly linked to the financial and operational performance of the Company.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nFuture cash flows from operations or through financings may not be sufficient to enable the Company to meet its obligations, and this would likely have a material adverse effect on its businesses, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company's debt is principally held by H&H Group, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of HNH. The Company's ability to meet its cash requirements to fund its activities in the ordinary course of business is dependent, in part, upon its ability to access cash from H&H Group's credit facilities, and also on the Company's continuing ability to materially meet its business plans. There can be no assurance that the funds available from operations and under the Company's credit facilities will be sufficient to fund its debt service costs, working capital demands, pension plan contributions, environmental remediation costs or any of the Company's other existing or future obligations. As of December 31, 2014, H&H Group's availability under its senior secured revolving credit facility was $101.0 million, and as of January 31, 2015, it was $178.2 million.\nThere can be no assurances that H&H Group will continue to have access to its lines of credit if the financial performance of its subsidiaries does not satisfy the financial covenants set forth in the applicable financing agreements. If H&H Group does not meet certain of its financial covenants , and if it is unable to secure necessary waivers or other amendments from the respective lenders on terms acceptable to management, its ability to access available lines of credit could be limited, its debt obligations could be accelerated by the respective lenders, liquidity could be adversely affected for H&H Group and H&H Group might not be able to provide funds to HNH, its parent, to enable HNH to meet its own financial obligations.\nIf the Company's cash needs are significantly greater than anticipated or the Company does not materially meet its business plans, the Company may be required to seek additional or alternative financing sources. There can be no assurance that such financing will be available or available on terms acceptable to the Company. The Company's inability to generate sufficient cash flows from its operations or through financing could impair its liquidity and would likely have a material adverse effect on its businesses, financial condition and results of operations.\nCredit market volatility may affect our ability to refinance our existing debt, borrow funds under our existing lines of credit or incur additional debt.\nIn the recent past, the global capital and credit markets experienced a period of unprecedented volatility. We recently refinanced certain of our bank debt. However, future disruption and volatility in credit market conditions could have a material adverse impact on our ability to refinance our debt when it comes due on terms similar to our current credit facilities, or to draw upon our existing lines of credit or incur additional debt if needed as a result of unanticipated downturns in the markets for our products and services, which may require us to seek other funding sources to meet our cash requirements. We cannot be certain that alternative sources of financing would be available to the Company in the future on terms and conditions acceptable to us, or at all.\nEconomic downturns could disrupt and materially harm our business.\nNegative trends in the general economy could cause a downturn in the market for our products and services. A significant portion of our revenues are received from customers in automotive and construction related industries, which have experienced\nPage | 6\nsignificant financial downturns in the past. These industries are cyclical and demand for their products tends to fluctuate due to changes in national and global economic conditions, availability of credit and other factors. A worsening of consumer demand in these industries would adversely affect our revenues, profitability, operating results and cash flows. We may also experience a slowdown if some customers experience difficulty in obtaining adequate financing due to tightness in the credit markets. Furthermore, the financial stability of our customers or suppliers may be compromised, which could result in additional bad debts for us or non-performance by suppliers. Our assets may also be impaired or subject to write-down or write-off as a result of these conditions. These adverse effects would likely be exacerbated if global economic conditions worsen, resulting in wide-ranging, adverse and prolonged effects on general business conditions, and materially and adversely affect our operations, financial results and liquidity.\nIn many cases, our competitors are larger than us and have manufacturing and financial resources greater than we do, which may have a negative impact on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nIn our served markets, we compete against foreign and domestic private and public companies that manufacture products of the type we manufacture. Some of these competitors are larger than we are and have financial resources greater than we do. This results in intense competition in a number of markets in which we operate. Some of these competitors enjoy certain other competitive advantages, including greater name recognition, greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources, a larger installed base of customers, and well-established relationships with current and potential customers. Competition is based on quality, technology, service, and price, and in some industries, new product introduction. We may not be able to compete successfully, and competition may have a negative impact on our business, operating results or financial condition by reducing volume of products sold and/or selling prices, and accordingly reducing our sales and profits.\nOur sales and profitability may be adversely affected by fluctuations in the cost and supply of raw materials and commodities.\nIn our production and distribution processes, we consume significant amounts of electricity, natural gas, fuel and other petroleum-based commodities, including adhesives and other products, as well as precious metals, steel products and certain non-ferrous metals used as raw materials. The availability and pricing of these commodities are subject to market forces that are beyond our control. Our suppliers contract separately for the purchase of such commodities, and our sources of supply could be interrupted should our suppliers not be able to obtain these materials due to higher demand or other factors interrupting their availability. Our results of operations may be adversely affected during periods in which either the prices of such commodities are unusually high, or their availability is restricted, or if we are unable to pass through the unfavorable impact of raw material price fluctuations to our customers, including any change associated with the margins we generate from the material portion of our products. In addition, we hold precious metal positions that are subject to market fluctuations. We enter into precious metal forward or futures contracts with major financial institutions to attempt to mitigate the economic risk of these price fluctuations, however, the Company's hedging strategy is designed to protect it against normal volatility; therefore, abnormal price changes in these commodities or markets could negatively impact HNH's earnings.\nWe do not have long-term contracts with all of our customers, the loss of which could materially adversely affect our financial condition, business and results of operations.\nOur businesses are based primarily upon individual orders and sales with our customers and not long-term supply contracts. As such, our customers could cease buying products at any time and for any reason, and we will have no recourse in the event a customer no longer wants to purchase products from us. If a significant number of our customers elect not to purchase products, it could materially adversely affect our financial condition, business and results of operations. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of HNH's consolidated net sales in 2014. However, the Company's 15 largest customers accounted for approximately 31% of consolidated net sales in 2014. If we were to lose our relationship with several of these customers, revenues and profitability could fall significantly.\nSome of our businesses are subject to certain risks associated with the movement of businesses offshore.\nSome of our businesses are potentially at risk of losing business to competitors operating in lower cost countries. An additional risk is the movement offshore of some of our businesses' customers, leading them to procure products from more closely located companies. Either of these factors could negatively impact our financial condition, business and results of operations.\nOur business strategy includes acquisitions, and acquisitions entail numerous risks, including the risk of management diversion and increased costs and expenses, all of which could negatively affect the Company's profitability.\nPage | 7\nOur business strategy includes, among other things, strategic acquisitions, as well as potential opportunistic acquisitions. This element of our strategy entails several risks, including the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns and the need to finance such acquisitions with additional equity and/or debt.\nIn addition, once completed, acquisitions entail further risks, including: unanticipated costs and liabilities of the acquired businesses, including environmental liabilities that could materially adversely affect our results of operations; difficulties in assimilating acquired businesses; negative effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers; and losing key employees of the acquired businesses. If our acquisition strategy is not successful or if acquisitions are not well integrated into our existing operations, the Company's profitability could be negatively affected.\nDivestitures could negatively impact our business, and contingent liabilities from businesses that we have sold could adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plans or are not achieving the desired return on investment. Divestitures pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business. For example, when we decide to sell a business or assets, we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms and within our anticipated timeframe, and even after reaching a definitive agreement to sell a business, the sale is typically subject to satisfaction of pre-closing conditions, which may not become satisfied. In addition, divestitures may dilute the Company's earnings per share, have other adverse accounting impacts and distract management, and disputes may arise with buyers. In addition, we have retained responsibility for and/or have agreed to indemnify buyers against some known and unknown contingent liabilities related to a number of businesses we have sold. The resolution of these contingencies has not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements, but we cannot be certain that this favorable pattern will continue.\nOur competitive advantage could be reduced if our intellectual property or related proprietary manufacturing processes become known by our competitors or if technological changes reduce our customers' need for our products.\nWe own a number of trademarks and patents in the United States and other jurisdictions on our products and related proprietary manufacturing processes. In addition to trademark and patent protection, we rely on trade secrets, proprietary know-how and technological advances that we seek to protect. If our intellectual property is not properly protected by us or is independently discovered by others or otherwise becomes known or if technological changes reduce our customers' need for our proprietary products, our protection against competitive products could be diminished, and our profitability could be substantially impaired.\nWe could incur significant costs, including remediation costs, as a result of complying with environmental laws.\nOur facilities and operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations imposed by federal, state, foreign and local authorities relating to the protection of the environment. Although we maintain insurance coverage for certain environmental matters, we could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines or sanctions, and third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws. We have incurred, and in the future may continue to incur, liability under environmental statutes and regulations with respect to the contamination detected at sites owned or operated by the Company (including contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites, abutters or other persons) and the sites at which we have disposed of hazardous substances. As of December 31, 2014, we have established a reserve totaling $2.4 million with respect to certain presently estimated environmental remediation costs. This reserve may not be adequate to cover the ultimate costs of remediation, including discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of additional cleanup obligations, which could result in significant additional costs. In addition, we expect that future regulations, and changes in the text or interpretation of existing regulations, may subject us to increasingly stringent standards. Compliance with such requirements may make it necessary for us to retrofit existing facilities with additional pollution-control equipment, undertake new measures in connection with the storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of by-products and wastes or take other steps, which may be at a substantial cost to us.\nOur future success depends greatly upon attracting and retaining qualified personnel, which could increase our labor costs and impair our profitability.\nA significant factor in our future profitability is our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified personnel. We receive certain executive and corporate services, including, without limitation, legal, tax, accounting, treasury, consulting, auditing, administrative, compliance, environmental health and safety, human resources, marketing, investor relations and other similar services under a management agreement with a related party. Our success in attracting qualified personnel is affected by changing demographics of the available pool of workers with the training and skills necessary to fill available positions, the impact on the labor supply due to general economic conditions, and our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefit packages.\nPage | 8\nIf we suffer loss to our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems or information technology systems due to catastrophe or other events, our operations could be seriously harmed.\nOur facilities, supply chains, distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, earthquake, hurricane, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters. If any of these facilities, supply chains or systems were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in defective products or services, damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal exposure and large repair or replacement expenses. The third-party insurance coverage that we maintain with respect to these and other risks will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on cost, availability and our decisions regarding risk retention, and may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against losses.\nA significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities. We also collect and store sensitive data, including confidential business information and personal data. These systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by computer hackers, computer viruses, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication or utility failures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events. In addition, security breaches of our systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers. Any such events could disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in defective products or services, damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties under privacy laws, each of which could adversely affect our business and our financial condition.\nLitigation could affect our profitability.\nThe nature of our businesses expose us to various litigation matters, including product liability claims, employment, health and safety matters, intellectual property infringement claims, environmental matters, regulatory and administrative proceedings, commercial disputes, or acquisition or divestiture-related matters. We contest these matters vigorously and make insurance claims where appropriate. However, litigation is inherently costly and unpredictable, making it difficult to accurately estimate the outcome of any litigation. These lawsuits may include claims for compensatory damages, punitive and consequential damages and/or injunctive relief. The defense of these lawsuits may divert our management's attention, we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits, and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. Moreover, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against such losses. In addition, developments in legal proceedings in any given period may require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our consolidated financial statements, record estimates or reserves for liabilities or assets previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates or pay cash settlements or judgments. Any of these developments could adversely affect our financial condition in any particular period. Although we make accruals as we believe warranted, the amounts that we accrue could vary significantly from any amounts we actually pay due to the inherent uncertainties in the estimation process. As of December 31, 2014, we have accrued approximately $2.4 million for environmental remediation costs but have not made any accruals for other litigation matters.\nOur businesses are subject to extensive regulation; failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial condition and reputation.\nOur businesses are subject to extensive regulation by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental and self-regulatory entities at the federal, state and local levels, including laws related to anti-corruption, environmental matters, health and safety, import laws and export control and economic sanctions, and the sale of products and services to government entities.\nIn addition, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo (\"DRC\") and adjoining countries. As a result, the SEC has adopted annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use conflict minerals mined from the DRC and adjoining countries in their products. The implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products. As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering \"conflict free\" conflict minerals, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary conflict minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we may implement.\nPage | 9\nThese are not the only regulations that our businesses must comply with. Failure to comply with these or any other regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, damage to our reputation, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to manufacture, import, export and sell products and services, disbarment from selling to certain federal agencies, damage to our reputation and loss of customers and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. Compliance with these and other regulations may also require us to incur significant expenses. Our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and failure to comply with these rules could result in withdrawal of certifications needed to sell our products and services and otherwise adversely impact our financial condition.\nOur internal controls over financial reporting may not be effective, and our independent auditors may not be able to certify as to their effectiveness, which could have a significant and adverse effect on our business and reputation.\nWe are subject to the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder (\"Section 404\"). Section 404 requires us to report on the design and effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. Section 404 also requires an independent registered public accounting firm to test our internal controls over financial reporting and report on the effectiveness of such controls. There can be no assurance that our auditors will issue an unqualified report attesting to our internal controls over financial reporting. As a result, there could be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our consolidated financial statements or our consolidated financial statements could change. Any failure to maintain or implement new or improved controls, or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation, could result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses, and cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations, or result in material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements. We may also be required to incur costs to improve our internal control system and hire additional personnel. This could negatively impact our results of operations.\nRisk Relating to Our Ownership Structure\nWarren G. Lichtenstein, our Chairman, and certain other Officers and Directors, through their affiliation with Steel Partners Holdings GP Inc., have the ability to exert significant influence over our operations.\nSteel Partners Holdings L.P. (\"SPLP\") owns directly or indirectly through its subsidiaries 7,131,185 shares of the Company's common stock, representing approximately 66.2% of the outstanding shares at December 31, 2014. SPLP may increase its ownership position in the Company's common stock in the future. The power to vote and dispose of the securities held by SPLP is controlled by Steel Partners Holdings GP Inc. (\"SPH GP\"). Warren G. Lichtenstein, our Chairman of the Board of Directors, is also the Executive Chairman of SPH GP. Mr. Lichtenstein has investment and voting control over the shares beneficially owned by SPLP and thus has the ability to exert significant influence over our policies and affairs and over the outcome of any action requiring a stockholder vote, including the election of our Board of Directors, the approval of amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, and the approval of mergers or sales of substantially all of our assets. The interests of Mr. Lichtenstein and SPH GP in such matters may differ from the interests of our other stockholders in some respects. In addition, certain other affiliates of SPH GP hold positions with HNH, including Jack L. Howard as Vice Chairman and Principal Executive Officer, Glen M. Kassan as Vice Chairman, John J. Quicke as Vice President, John H. McNamara Jr., as Director, James F. McCabe, Jr., as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Leonard J. McGill as Senior Vice President and Chief Legal Officer.\nFactors Affecting the Value of Our Common Stock\nTransfer restrictions contained in our charter and other factors could hinder the development of an active market for our common stock.\nThere can be no assurance as to the volume of shares of our common stock or the degree of price volatility for our common stock traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market. There are transfer restrictions contained in our charter to help preserve our net operating tax loss carryforwards that will generally prevent any person from acquiring amounts of our common stock such that such person would hold 5% or more of our common stock, for up to ten years after July 29, 2005, as specifically provided in our charter. The transfer restrictions could hinder development of an active market for our common stock.\nWe do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, which may limit investor demand.\nWe do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Such lack of dividend prospects may have an adverse impact on the market demand for our common stock as certain institutional investors may invest only in dividend-paying equity securities or may operate under other restrictions that may prohibit or limit their ability to invest in our common stock.\nPage | 10\nFuture offerings of our equity securities may result in dilution of our common stock and a reduction in the price of our common stock.\nWe are authorized to issue 180,000,000 shares of common stock. On February 26, 2015, 10,775,689 shares of common stock were outstanding. In addition, we are authorized to issue 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock. On February 26, 2015, no shares of our preferred stock were outstanding. Although our Board of Directors is expressly authorized to fix the designations, preferences and rights, limitations or restrictions of the preferred stock by adoption of a Preferred Stock Designation resolution, our Board of Directors has not yet done so. Our Board of Directors may elect to issue shares of common stock or preferred stock in the future to raise capital or for other financial needs. Any future issuances of equity may be at prices below the market price of our stock, and our stockholders may suffer significant dilution, and the terms of any preferred stock issuance may adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders.", "PERMNO": 92872, "SIC": 3420, "TIC": "HNH"}
