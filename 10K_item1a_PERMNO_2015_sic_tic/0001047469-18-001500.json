{"cik": "1585023", "company": "Coastway Bancorp, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur commercial real estate, commercial business loans and commercial construction loans generally carry greater credit risk than loans secured by owner occupied one- to four-family real estate, and these risks will increase if we succeed in our plan to increase these types of loans.\nAt December 31, 2017, $173.2 million, or 28.3%, of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial real estate and commercial business loans. Given their larger balances and the complexity of the underlying collateral, commercial real estate and commercial business loans generally expose a lender to greater credit risk than loans secured by owner occupied one- to four-family real estate. Also, many of our borrowers have more than one of these types of loans outstanding. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one- to four-family residential real estate loan. These loans also have greater credit risk than residential real estate for the following reasons:\n\u2022 commercial real estate loans-repayment is generally dependent on income being generated in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service.\n\u2022 commercial business loans-repayment is generally dependent upon the successful operation of the borrower's business.\n\u2022 Commercial construction loans-repayment is generally dependent on the estimate of value of the property at completion of construction. Upon completion of construction, these loans generally convert to permanent loans.\nIf loans that are collateralized by real estate or other business assets become troubled and the value of the collateral has been significantly impaired, then we may not be able to recover the full contractual amount of principal and interest that we anticipated at the time we originated the loan, which could cause us to increase our provision for loan losses which would in turn adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nFurthermore, a key component of our strategy is to continue to increase our origination of commercial real estate and commercial business loans to diversify our loan portfolio and increase our yields. The proposed increase in these types of loans significantly increases our exposure to the risks inherent in these types of loans.\nWe have a high concentration of loans secured by real estate in our market area. Difficult economic conditions, both generally and in our market area, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAt December 31, 2017, $357.5 million, or 58.3% of our total loan portfolio, consisted of loans secured by real estate in the state of Rhode Island and $117.8 million, or 19.2% of our total loan portfolio, consisted of real estate loans in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. We have relatively few loans outside of our market area, and, as a result, we have a greater risk of loan defaults and losses in the event of weakness and/or a economic downturn in our market area, as adverse economic conditions may have a negative effect on the ability of our borrowers to make timely payments of their loans.\nA deterioration in economic conditions or a recession in the market areas we serve could result in the following consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations:\n\u2022 loan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures may increase;\n\u2022 weak economic conditions may limit the demand for loans by creditworthy borrowers, limiting our capacity to leverage our retail deposits and maintain our net interest income;\n\u2022 the value of the collateral for our loans may decline;\n\u2022 demand for our deposits and services may decline; and\n\u2022 the amount of our low-cost or non-interest-bearing deposits may decrease.\nIf our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings and capital could decrease.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our borrowers may default on their obligations. A borrower's default on its obligations under one or more loans may result in lost principal and interest income and increased operating expenses as a result of the allocation of management time and resources to the collection and work-out of the loan. In certain situations, where collection efforts are unsuccessful or acceptable work-out arrangements cannot be reached, we may have to charge-off the loan in whole or in part. In such situations, we may acquire real estate or other assets, if any, that secure the loan through foreclosure or other similar available remedies, and the amount owed under the defaulted loan may exceed the value of the assets acquired.\nWe make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for many of our loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we review our loans and our loss and delinquency experience, and we evaluate other factors including, among other things, current economic conditions. If our assumptions are incorrect, or if delinquencies do not continue to improve or non-accrual and non-performing loans increase, our allowance for loan\nlosses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, which would require additions to our allowance, which could materially decrease our net income.\nIn addition, bank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and, based on their judgments and information available to them at the time of their review, may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. An increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities may result in a decrease of our net income and, possibly, our capital position, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur nonconforming loan portfolio exposes us to increased credit risk.\nA significant portion of our one- to four-family residential real estate loans are nonconforming to secondary market requirements, and are therefore not saleable to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Federal Housing Administration (\"FHA\") or Rhode Island Housing. At December 31, 2017, $236.4 million, or 75.8%, of our one- to four-family residential loan portfolio consisted of loans that were considered nonconforming because they exceeded the maximum balance allowable for sale (generally $424,100 for single-family homes in our market area), or jumbo loans. At December 31, 2017, we had three jumbo loans totaling $1.8 million that are considered impaired loans.\nWe generally limit the loan-to-value (\"LTV\") ratios of our mortgage loans without private mortgage insurance to 80% of the sales price or appraised value, whichever is lower. Loans where the borrower obtains private mortgage insurance (\"PMI\") may be made with loan-to-value ratios up to 97%. From time to time we may originate mortgage loans with loan-to-value ratios greater than 80% with no private mortgage insurance. Such loans totaled $47.3 million and $37.0 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively or 15.1% and 14.8% of one- to four-family mortgage loans, and have an average loan-to-value ratio of 85% at December 31, 2017 and 2016. Of the $47.3 million in residential loans with a greater than 80% LTV ratio at December 31, 2017, $32.0 million or 66.4% are jumbo loans. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we originated $18.6 million of one- to four-family loans with a greater than 80% loan-to-value ratio with no PMI at an average loan-to-value ratio of 89%. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we originated $9.7 million of one- to four-family loans with a greater than 80% loan-to-value ratio with no PMI at an average loan-to-value ratio of 87%. The Bank considers the incremental credit risk on these loans as compared to the remaining residential mortgage portfolio as a component of its concentration qualitative reserve factor. Impaired loans at December 31, 2017 included $1.3 million, or 2.7% of the loans with a greater than 80% LTV ratio and no PMI.\nFrom 2000 until early 2006, we originated loans to borrowers who provided limited or no documentation of income, known as stated income loans. A stated income loan is a loan where the borrower's income source is not subject to verification through the application process. At December 31, 2017, we had $2.1 million in stated income loans, or 0.7% of our one- to four-family residential real estate loan portfolio, of which $347,000 was non-performing loans and $525,000 were accruing troubled debt restructured loans. Subsequent to 2006, we have not and we have no intention of originating stated income loans again in the future. Approximately 38.0% of the $2.1 million in stated income loans were made to borrowers who had existing commercial relationships and financial information on file with us.\nJumbo one- to four-family residential loans have increased risk due to their potential for greater exposure to loss as a result of their larger balances, which cannot be sold to government sponsored enterprises. Loans greater than 80% LTV and no PMI have a greater exposure for losses due to a higher loan balance as compared to their collateral value that is not mitigated by private mortgage insurance. Stated income loans have increased risk due to the lack of income verification applied to such loans which could result in higher rates of default. If our nonconforming one- to four-family\nresidential real estate loans do not perform, it will have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur significant concentration of home equity loans and lines of credit exposes us to increased credit risk.\nAt December 31, 2017, $71.8 million, or 11.7%, of our loan portfolio consisted of home equity loans and lines of credit, of which $39.6 million are in a junior lien position, with an average loan size of $39,000. Prior economic conditions resulted in declines in real estate values in our market areas from before the Great Recession. These declines in real estate values coupled with the possibility of future declines in real estate values, could cause some of our home equity loans and lines of credit to be inadequately collateralized, which could expose us to a greater risk of loss if we seek to recover on defaulted loans by foreclosing and selling the real estate collateral, or if another lender has priority over us, and we may be unsuccessful in recovering the remaining balance on defaulted loans after the senior liens are satisfied.\nFuture changes in interest rates could reduce our profits.\nThe majority of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, our earnings and growth are significantly affected by interest rates, which are subject to the influence of economic conditions generally, both domestic and foreign, to events in the capital markets and also to the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States and its agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve Board. Changes in interest rates can affect our net interest income as well as the value of our assets and liabilities. Net interest income is the difference between (i) interest income on interest-earning assets, such as loans, and (ii) interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowed funds. Changes in market interest rates, changes in the relationships between short-term and long-term market interest rates, or the yield curve, or changes in the relationships between different interest rate indices can affect the interest rates charged on interest-earning assets differently than the interest rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities.\nStarting in 2015 and continuing into 2017, based on the growth in our residential one- to four-family loan portfolio coupled with the level of short-term borrowed funds, our interest-bearing liabilities may re-price more quickly than our interest-earning assets in an increasing interest rate environment. For the years ended December 31, 2017and 2016, our net interest margin was 3.16% and 3.31%, respectively. Our net interest income was also impacted by the increase in short-term interest rates, while long-term rates and spreads have not increased to the same degree, causing our interest-bearing liabilities to reprice at a higher increment than our loans. Our asset/liability management committee utilizes a simulation model to provide an analysis of estimated changes in the net present value of equity in various interest rate scenarios. Increases in interest rates may decrease loan demand and/or make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable-rate loans. The Bank may be required to pay higher rates on deposits (including national market certificates of deposit) or other borrowed funds than the Bank is currently paying. Conversely, a reduction in interest rates can result in increased prepayments of loans, as borrowers refinance their debt in order to reduce their borrowing costs. This creates reinvestment risk, which is the risk that we may not be able to reinvest prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates we earned on the prepaid loans. In addition, we may not be able to lower our cost of funds as quickly as certain loans mature, re-price or are refinanced, which may cause a decline in our net interest margin.\nExtension of the duration of interest-bearing liabilities could reduce our profits.\nThe majority of our borrowed funds mature over short term periods, generally overnight to two months. Interest rates on short-term borrowed funds are lower than long-term advances. Our interest expense has been favorably impacted by the lower funding costs of short-term borrowed funds.\nIncreases in market interest rates or changes in the mix of short-term and long-term borrowed funds may increase our cost of funds, which may cause a decline in our net interest margin.\nSimilarly, the cost of our deposits is impacted by the level of non-maturity deposits and certificates of deposit. The interest rates paid on certificates of deposit are generally higher than non-maturity deposits. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, certificates of deposit totaled $163.3 million, or 34.2% of deposits and $162.9 million, or 36.4% of deposits respectively. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, certificates of deposit include $39.2 million and $44.4 million of national market certificates at a weighted average rate of 1.62% and 1.48%, respectively.\nWe increased our levels of national market certificates of deposit in anticipation of an increase in interest rates, to repay borrowed funds and bolster on-balance sheet liquidity. An increase in longer-term national market certificates of deposit as compared to utilizing short-term FHLB advances may increase our cost of funds, which may cause a decline in our net interest margin.\nIncrease in on-balance sheet liquidity could reduce our profits.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we increased our on-balance sheet liquidity, with cash and cash equivalents and certificates of deposit totaling $54.6 million, or 7.4% of consolidated assets from $44.7 million or 6.9% of consolidated assets at December 31, 2016. Cash and cash equivalents generally earn less interest income than loans. The increase in on-balance sheet liquidity was funded through a combination of organic deposit growth, national market certificates of deposit as well as FHLB advances. Our cost of funds may exceed the yield earned on cash and cash equivalents, which may decrease our net interest income, net interest margin and net income.\nIncome from secondary mortgage market operations is volatile, and we may incur losses with respect to our secondary mortgage market operations that could negatively affect our earnings.\nA key component of our strategy is to increase the extent to which we sell in the secondary market the longer term, conforming fixed-rate residential mortgage loans that we originate, earning non-interest income in the form of gains on sale. When interest rates rise, the demand for mortgage loans tends to fall and may reduce the number of loans we can originate for sale. Weak or deteriorating economic conditions also tend to reduce loan demand. Although we generally originate loans for sale on a \"best efforts\" basis, and we sell, and intend to continue selling, most loans in the secondary market with limited or no recourse, we are required, and will continue to be required, to give customary representations and warranties to the buyers relating to compliance with applicable law. If we breach those representations and warranties, the buyers will be able to require us to repurchase the loans and we may incur a loss on the repurchase.\nThe Bank utilizes both best efforts forward loan sale commitments and effective September 1, 2015, also began utilizing mandatory delivery forward loan sale commitments, and To Be Announced (\"TBA\") Securities, which are sold from approved counterparties to mitigate the risk of potential changes in the values of derivative loan commitments.\nFor TBAs, the Bank sells a security in the open market with a promise to deliver a pool of loans with an aggregate specified principal amount and quality to the investor at a specified point in the future. If the Bank fails to deliver the pool of loans, the Bank will repurchase the security at the market price on the date of repurchase, which could negatively impact our earnings.\nFair value changes in mortgage banking derivatives and commitments to sell fixed-rate residential mortgages subsequent to inception are estimated using anticipated market prices based on pricing indications provided from syndicate banks and consideration of pull-through and fallout rates derived from the Bank's internal data and adjusted using management judgment. Mortgage banking derivatives include the non-refundable costs of originating the loan based on the Bank's internal cost analysis that\nis not observable. Fluctuations in interest rates may impact estimated pull-through rates on mortgage originations, which in turn may affect the valuation of forward loan sale commitments, and could negatively affect our earnings.\nIf our foreclosed real estate decline in value, our earnings could be reduced.\nWe periodically may obtain updated valuations in the form of appraisals and broker price opinions during the holding period of the foreclosed asset. Our net book value, or NBV, is compared to the updated fair value of the foreclosed property less estimated selling costs (fair value). If property values decline, the fair value of our foreclosed real estate may not be sufficient to recover our carrying value in such assets, resulting in the need for additional write-downs. In addition, bank regulators periodically review our foreclosed real estate and may require us to recognize further write-downs. Any increase in write-downs may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nStrong competition within our market areas may limit our growth and profitability.\nCompetition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. In our market area, we compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere. The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of new legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. Banks, securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company, which can offer virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting) and merchant banking. Also, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. These competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures.\nSome of our competitors have greater name recognition and market presence that benefit them in attracting business, and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide. In addition, larger competitors may choose to price loans and deposits more aggressively than we do, which could affect our ability to grow and remain profitable on a long-term basis. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market area. If we must raise interest rates paid on deposits or lower interest rates charged on our loans, our net interest margin and profitability could be adversely affected.\nWe depend on our management team to implement our business strategy and we could be harmed by the loss of their services.\nWe are dependent upon the services of the members of our senior management team who direct our strategy and operations. We have benefited from consistency within our senior management team, with our top five executives averaging over 13 years of service with Coastway Community Bank and more than a combined 181 years of financial institution experience. Members of our senior management team, or lending specialists who possess expertise in our markets and maintain key business relationships, could be difficult to replace. Our loss of these persons, or our inability to hire additional qualified personnel, could impact our ability to implement our business strategy and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our ability to compete in our markets.\nWe may be adversely affected by recent changes in U.S. tax laws and regulations.\nChanges in tax laws contained in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was enacted in December 2017, include a number of provisions that will have an impact on the banking industry, borrowers and the market for single-family residential real estate. Included in this legislation is a reduction of the\ncorporate income tax rate from 34% to 21%. In addition, other changes include (i) a lower limit on the deductibility of mortgage interest on single-family residential mortgage loans, (ii) the elimination of interest deductions for home equity loans, (iii) a limitation on the deductibility of business interest expense and (iv) a limitation on the deductibility of property taxes and state and local income taxes. These recent changes in the tax laws may have an adverse effect on the market for, and valuation of, residential properties, and on the demand for such loans in the future, and could make it harder for borrowers to make their loan payments. In addition, these recent changes may also have a disproportionate effect on taxpayers in states with high residential home prices and high state and local taxes, such as Rhode Island and Massachusetts. If home ownership becomes less attractive, demand for mortgage loans could decrease. The value of the properties securing loans in our loan portfolio may be adversely impacted as a result of the changing economics of home ownership, which could require an increase in our provision for loan losses, which would reduce our profitability and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFinancial reform legislation will result in new laws and regulations that are expected to increase our costs of operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, has changed and will continue to change the bank regulatory framework. The legislation will also result in new regulations affecting the lending, funding, trading and investment activities of banks and bank holding companies. An independent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has assumed the consumer protection responsibilities of the various federal banking agencies and has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions such as Coastway Community Bank, including the authority to prohibit \"unfair, deceptive or abusive\" acts and practices. Banks and savings institutions with $10.0 billion or less in assets will continue to be examined by their applicable bank regulators. The new legislation also gives state attorneys general the ability to enforce applicable federal consumer protection laws. The Dodd-Frank Act also requires the federal banking agencies to promulgate rules requiring mortgage lenders to retain a portion of the credit risk related to securitized loans. Bank regulatory agencies also have been responding aggressively to concerns and adverse trends identified in examinations. These measures are likely to increase our costs of doing business and increase our costs related to regulatory compliance, and may have a significant adverse effect on our lending activities, financial performance and operating flexibility.\nWe have become subject to more stringent capital requirements, which may adversely impact our return on equity, require us to raise additional capital, or constrain us from paying dividends or repurchasing shares.\nIn July 2013, the FDIC approved a new rule that substantially amends the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to Coastway Community Bank. The final rule implements the \"Basel III\" regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act.\nThe final rule includes new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which became effective for Coastway Community Bank on January 1, 2015, and refines the definition of what constitutes \"capital\" for purposes of calculating these ratios. The new minimum capital requirements are: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); (iii) a total capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from current rules); and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. The final rule also establishes a \"capital conservation buffer\" of 2.5%, and will result in the following minimum ratios inclusive of the capital conservation buffer upon full implementation in January 2019: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The new capital conservation buffer requirement began to be phased in in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increases each year until fully implemented in January 2019. In 2018, the capital conservation buffer requirement will be 1.875% of risk-weighted assets. An institution will be subject to\nlimitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such actions.\nThe application of more stringent capital requirements for Coastway Community Bank could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, require the raising of additional capital, and result in regulatory actions constraining us from paying dividends or repurchasing shares if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision, and examination by the Federal Reserve Board, the Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation and the FDIC. Such regulators govern the activities in which we may engage, primarily for the protection of depositors. These regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on the operation of a financial institution, the classification of assets by a financial institution, and the adequacy of a financial institution's allowance for loan losses. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, or legislation, could have a material impact on us and our operations. Because our business is highly regulated, the laws, rules and applicable regulations are subject to regular modification and change. Laws, rules and regulations may be adopted in the future that could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition or prospects. See \"Supervision and Regulation\" for a discussion of the regulations to which we are subject.\nChanges in accounting standards could affect reported earnings.\nThe accounting standard setters, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\"), the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulatory bodies, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting guidance that governs the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply new or revised guidance retroactively.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued a standard, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses, that will significantly change how banks measure and recognize credit impairment for many financial assets from an incurred loss methodology to a current expected loss model. The current expected credit loss model will require banks to immediately recognize an estimate of credit losses expected to occur over the remaining life of the financial assets that are in the scope of the standard. We are currently evaluating the impact of adoption of this standard, including different methodologies that may be employed to estimate credit losses, such as loss rate methods, component loss methods, and qualitative factors, as well as additional data gathering that will be needed to adopt the standard. The standard will add new disclosures related to factors that influenced management's estimate, including current expected credit losses, the changes in those factors, and reasons for the changes as well as the method applied to revert to historical credit loss experience.\nWe are a community bank and our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance.\nWe are a community bank, and our reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business. A key component of our business strategy is to rely on our reputation for customer service and knowledge of local markets to expand our presence by capturing new business opportunities from existing and prospective customers in our current market and contiguous areas. As such, we strive to\nconduct our business in a manner that enhances our reputation. This is done, in part, by recruiting, hiring and retaining employees who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities we serve, delivering superior service to our customers and caring about our customers and associates. If our reputation is negatively affected, by the actions of our employees, by our inability to conduct our operations in a manner that is appealing to current or prospective customers, or otherwise, our business and operating results may be adversely affected.\nRisks associated with system failures, interruptions, or breaches of security could negatively affect our earnings.\nInformation technology systems are critical to our business. We use various technology systems to manage our customer relationships, general ledger, deposits, and loans. We have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of system failures, interruptions, and security breaches, but such events may still occur or may not be adequately addressed if they do occur. In addition, any compromise of our systems could deter customers from using our products and services. Although we rely on security systems to provide security and authentication necessary to effect the secure transmission of data, these precautions may not protect our systems from compromises or breaches of security.\nIn addition, we outsource a majority of our data processing to certain third-party providers. If these third-party providers encounter difficulties, or if we have difficulty communicating with them, our ability to adequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and our business operations could be adversely affected. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other vendors and their personnel.\nThe occurrence of any system failures, interruption, or breach of security could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business, could subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or could expose us to litigation and possible financial liability. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThere may be a limited trading market in our common stock, which would hinder your ability to sell our common stock and may lower the market price of the stock.\nOur common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \"CWAY.\" The development of an active trading market depends on the existence of willing buyers and sellers, the presence of which is not within our control, or that of any market maker. The number of active buyers and sellers of the shares of common stock at any particular time may be limited. Under such circumstances, you could have difficulty selling your shares of common stock on short notice, and, therefore, you should not view the shares of common stock as a short-term investment. In addition, our public \"float,\" which is the total number of our outstanding shares less the shares held by our employee stock ownership plan, the charitable foundation and our directors and executive officers, is likely to be quite limited. As a result, it is unlikely that an active trading market for the common stock will develop or that, if it develops, it will continue. Purchasers of our common stock should have long-term investment intent and should recognize that there will be a limited trading market in the common stock. This may make it difficult to sell the common stock and may have an adverse impact on the price at which the common stock can be sold.\nWe are an emerging growth company within the meaning of the Securities Act, and if we decide to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, our common stock could be less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \"emerging growth company,\" as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as modified by the JOBS Act. We are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from\nvarious reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, reduced disclosure about our executive compensation and omission of compensation discussion and analysis, and an exemption from the requirement of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation. In addition, we will not be subject to certain requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, including the additional level of review of our internal control over financial reporting as may occur when outside auditors attest as to our internal control over financial reporting. As a result, our stockholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important.\nWe could remain an \"emerging growth company\" for up to five years following completion of our initial public offering, or until the earliest of (a) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1.0 billion, (b) the date that we become a \"large accelerated filer\" as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (c) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period. Taking advantage of any of these exemptions may adversely affect the value and trading price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 14425, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "CWAY"}
