{"cik": "867374", "company": "ELECTRONICS FOR IMAGING INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A: Risk Factors\nIf we fail to continue to introduce new products that achieve market acceptance on a timely basis, we will not be able to compete effectively, and we will be unable to increase or maintain net revenue and gross margins.\nWe operate in a highly competitive and quickly changing environment. Our future success depends in large part upon our ability to identify demand trends and quickly develop or acquire, and manufacture and sell, products that satisfy these demands in a cost-effective manner. In order to differentiate our products from our competitors\u2019 products, we must continue to invest in research and development. For example, we need a broad product portfolio and have identified gaps such as those we are currently experiencing in the high-end of Display Graphics, and are committing substantial resources to develop new products to strengthen our product portfolio.\nSuccessfully predicting demand trends is difficult, and it is very difficult to predict the effect introducing any new products will have on our existing product sales. We will also need to respond effectively to new product announcements by our competitors and quickly introduce or enhance competitive products. Any delays in product development and introduction, or product introductions that do not meet broad market acceptance, or unsuccessful launches of new product lines, could result in:\n\u2022\nloss of or delay in revenue and loss of market share;\n\u2022\nnegative publicity and damage to our reputation and brands;\n\u2022\na decline in the average selling price of our products;\n\u2022\nadverse reactions in our sales channels, such as reduced online product visibility, or loss of a sales channel;\n\u2022\nproduct returns; or\n\u2022\nfailure to recover amounts invested.\nWe face competition in our Industrial Inkjet and Productivity Software operating segments which could cause downward pressure on prices and loss of market share.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets in our Industrial Inkjet and Productivity Software segments.\n\u2022\nOur super-wide and wide format industrial inkjet products compete against several companies that market industrial inkjet printing systems based on electrostatic, drop-on-demand, and continuous drop-on-demand inkjet and other technologies and printers utilizing UV curable ink, including Agfa, Durst, Canon, HP, Inco, Mimaki, Roland, and Mutoh;\n\u2022\nOur Reggiani industrial inkjet textile printers compete with printers offered by Dover, Durst, Mimaki, Roland, Epson, Konica Minolta, Robustelli, Atexco, Shenzhen Homer Textile, Kornit and Digital Graphics;\n\u2022\nOur Cretaprint ceramic tile decoration inkjet printers compete with ceramic tile decoration printers manufactured in Spain, Austria, Italy, Brazil, China, and smaller emerging competitors in other markets such as Indonesia;\n\u2022\nOur Productivity Software operating segment faces competition from software application vendors, which include many small private companies, that specifically target the printing industry, as well as larger vendors that currently offer, or are seeking to develop, business process automation printing products. Competitors include HP, Epicor and SAP; and\n\u2022\nOur packaging software market faces competition from Oracle, SAP, SolarSoft, and Heidelberg, and our Optitex 3D CAD software competes with Lectra, Assyst, CLO, Browzwear, and Gerber.\nSome of our competitors have greater resources to develop new products and technologies and market those products, as well as acquire or develop critical components at lower costs, which would provide them with a competitive advantage. Our competitors could also exert downward pressure on product pricing to gain market share.\nFor example, the local competitors in the Chinese and Korean markets are developing, manufacturing, and selling inexpensive printers mainly to the local markets and in the ceramic tile decoration market, small Chinese ceramic tile decoration digital inkjet printer manufacturers and European manufacturers have been reducing prices to gain market share. We also face competition from existing conventional and digital inkjet super-wide and wide format printing methods,\nincluding screen printing and offset printing and Reggiani faces competition from other digital inkjet textile printing technologies including pre-washing and post-washing printing techniques.\nWe face strong competition for printing supplies such as ink and we have experienced supply issues in ink production, which may limit our growth in ink sales.\nWe compete with independent manufacturers in the ink market consisting of smaller vendors, as well as larger vendors such as DuPont Digital Printing and Sun Chemical.\nOur UV curable ink is sold to users of our super-wide and wide format UV industrial inkjet printers, which have advanced quality control systems to ensure that correct color and non-expired ink is used to prevent damage to the printer. This results in most ink used in our super-wide and wide format printers being sold by us. While third party ink is available, its use compromises the printer\u2019s quality control system and voids most provisions of our printer warranty and service contracts. Nevertheless, we cannot guarantee we will be able to remain the principal ink supplier for our super-wide and wide format UV industrial inkjet printers. We could experience an overall price reduction within the ink market, which would also adversely affect our gross profit.\nWe sell both our own inks and third party branded textile ink to users of our textile inkjet printer. We offer a strong value proposition with our own and third party branded inks, but cannot guarantee that we will be the primary supplier of textile ink to the users of our printers as these branded inks are available on the market.\nOur solvent-based ceramic ink is sold to users of our ceramic tile decoration inkjet printers. The ceramic ink market is generally an open system for ink and therefore customers may change between suppliers. Although we are focused on developing this recurring revenue stream, we cannot guarantee that we will become the primary supplier of ceramic ink to the users of our printers.\nIn addition, we have recently experienced supply issues, primarily in China, where we saw changes in tariff structure, price increases in ink components, and short supplies of ink components due to reduced production levels at a number of suppliers, which limited the amount of ink we could manufacture. Although we are working to increase purchases from new sources for ink components, we may not be able to supply the same volume of ink as we have historically and may lose market share to our competitors, thereby limiting our growth in ink sales.\nIf the market for digital textile printing does not develop as we anticipate, we may not be able to grow our digital inkjet textile printing business.\nIf the global printed textile industry does not broadly accept digital printing as an alternative to either analog printing or single color (dyed) garments, our revenue may not grow as quickly as expected. Widespread adoption of digital textile printing depends on the willingness and ability of businesses in the printed textile industry to replace their existing analog printing systems and single color (dyed) garments with digital printing systems. The adoption of digital textile printing is dependent to some extent on the growth of \u201cfast fashion.\u201d\nA key element of our digital inkjet textile printing growth strategy is to market digital inkjet printing systems to contract printers that serve major textile brand owners and fashion designers. If leading textile brand owners and fashion designers are not convinced of the benefits of digital inkjet textile printing or if there is a significant reduction in the popularity of printed textiles, especially those that are customized or personalized, among the consumers to whom such brand owners and fashion designers cater, or if these businesses decide that digital inkjet printing processes are less reliable, less cost-effective, lower quality, or otherwise less suitable for their commercial needs than analog printing processes and single color (dyed) garments, then the market for digital textile printers and software may not develop as we anticipate and we may not be able to grow our inkjet textile printing business.\nWe do not typically have long-term purchase commitments with the printer manufacturer customers that purchase and resell our Fiery DFE and software solutions. They have in the past reduced or ceased to purchase products from us, and could at any time in the future reduce or cease to purchase products from us, thereby harming our operating results and business.\nAlthough end customer and reseller channel preference for Fiery DFE and software solutions drives demand, most Fiery revenue relies on printer manufacturers to integrate Fiery technology into the design and development of their print engines. We have established direct relationships with several leading printer manufacturers and work closely with them to design, develop, and integrate Fiery DFE and software technology to maximize the capability of their print engines. These manufacturers act as distributors and sell Fiery products to end customers through reseller channels. A significant portion of our revenue is, and has been, generated by sales of our Fiery DFE and software solutions to a relatively small number of leading printer manufacturers. Our reliance on revenue from the leading printer manufacturers was 22%, 26%, and 28% of our consolidated revenue, during 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Because sales of our Fiery products constitute a significant portion of our revenue and there are a limited number of printer manufacturers producing printers in sufficient volume to be attractive customers for us, we expect that we will continue to depend on a relatively small number of printer manufacturers for a significant portion of our Fiery revenue in future periods. Accordingly, if we lose or experience reduced sales to one of these printer manufacturer customers, we will have difficulty replacing that revenue with sales to new or existing customers.\nWith the exception of certain minimum purchase obligations, we typically do not have long-term volume purchase contracts with our significant printer manufacturer customers, including Konica Minolta, Ricoh, and Canon, and they are not obligated to purchase products from us. Accordingly, our printer manufacturer customers could at any time reduce their purchases from us or cease purchasing our products altogether. In the past, these printer manufacturer customers have elected to develop products on their own for sale to end customers, incorporated technologies developed by other companies into their products, and have directly sold third party competitive products, rather than rely solely or partially on our products. We expect that these printer manufacturer customers will continue to make such elections in the future.\nMany of the products and technologies we are developing require that we coordinate development, quality testing, marketing, and other tasks with these printer manufacturers. We cannot control their development efforts or the timing of these efforts. We rely on these printer manufacturers to develop new printer and copier solutions, applications, and product enhancements that utilize our Fiery DFE technologies and software solutions in a timely and cost-effective manner. Our success in the DFE industry depends on the ability of these printer manufacturers to utilize our technologies to develop the right solutions with the right features to meet ever changing customer requirements and responding to emerging industry standards and other technological changes.\nBecause our printer manufacturer customers incorporate our products into products they manufacture and sell, any decline in demand for copiers or laser printers or any other negative developments affecting our major customers or the computer industry in general, including reduced end user demand, would likely harm our results of operations. Certain printer manufacturer customers have experienced serious financial difficulties in the past, which led to a decline in sales of our products. If any significant customers face such difficulties in the future, our operating results could be harmed through, among other things, decreased sales volume, write-off of accounts receivable, and write-off of inventories related to products we have manufactured for these customers\u2019 products.\nEconomic uncertainty has negatively affected our business in the past and may negatively affect our business in the future.\nOur revenue and profitability depend significantly on the overall demand for information technology products that enable printing of digital data, which in turn depends on a variety of macro- and micro-economic conditions. In addition, revenue growth and profitability in our Industrial Inkjet operating segment depends on demand and spending for advertising and marketing products and programs, which also depends on a variety of macro-and micro-economic conditions.\nUncertainty about current global economic conditions poses a risk as our customers may delay purchases of our products in response to tighter credit, negative financial news, and/or declines in income or asset values. For example, during the fourth quarter, we experienced many of our customers delaying spending on capital equipment and software as they became\nincreasingly concerned about the economic environment. Any financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets and the possibility that financial institutions may consolidate or terminate their activities have resulted in a tightening in the credit market, a low level of liquidity in many financial markets, and extreme volatility in fixed income, credit, currency, and equity markets. There could be a number of follow-on effects from a credit crisis on our business, including insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays; inability of customers and distributors to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products and/or customer and distributor insolvencies; increased difficulty in managing inventories; and other financial institutions negatively impacting our treasury operations.\nEconomic uncertainty remains in the European countries due to uncertainty associated with Brexit, uncertainty in Spain related to Catalonia, and uncertainty in Italy related to significant public debt and uncollectible loans in the banking system, among other considerations. We have no European sovereign debt investments. Our European debt investments consist of non-sovereign corporate debt securities of $4.5 million, which represents 10% of our corporate debt instruments (4% of our short-term investments) as of December 31, 2018. European debt investments are with corporations domiciled in the northern and central European countries of Netherlands, Sweden, and France. We do not have any short-term investments with corporations domiciled in the higher risk \u201csouthern European\u201d countries (i.e., Italy, Spain, and Portugal). We believe that we do not have significant exposure with respect to our money market and corporate debt investments in Europe, although we do have some exposure due to the interdependencies among the European Union countries.\nEconomic conditions and regulatory changes leading up to and following the United Kingdom\u2019s likely exit from the European Union could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThere remains significant uncertainty about the process for and the impacts of the U.K.'s leaving the European Union, typically referred to as Brexit. While the full effects of Brexit will not be known for some time, Brexit could cause disruptions to, and create uncertainty surrounding, our business and results of operations. The most immediate effect has been significant volatility in global equity and debt markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations. Ongoing global market volatility and a deterioration in economic conditions due to uncertainty surrounding Brexit, could significantly disrupt the markets in which we operate and lead our customers to closely monitor their costs and delay capital spending decisions.\nThe effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the U.K. makes to retain access to E.U. markets, either during a transitional period or more permanently. The measures could potentially disrupt the markets we serve and may cause us to lose customers and employees. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which E.U. laws to replace or replicate as well as potential import duties for the products we produce in the U.K. and export to the European Union.\nWe have significant customers and operations in the U.K. and any of these effects of Brexit could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business, results of operations, and financial condition may be negatively impacted by conditions abroad, including local economies, political environments, fluctuating foreign currencies, shifting regulatory schemes, and the imposition of tariffs.\nA significant amount of our revenue is generated from operations outside the U.S. We expect that sales outside of the U.S. will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenue. We maintain significant operations and acquire or manufacture many of our products and/or their components outside the U.S. Our future revenue, costs, and results of operations could be significantly affected by changes in each country\u2019s economic conditions, foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar, political conditions, trade protection measures, licensing requirements, local tax issues, capitalization, and other related legal matters. If our future revenue, costs, and results of operations are significantly affected by economic conditions abroad, our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted. Specifically, the deceleration of the economy in China has negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, our results of operations as our customers in China reduce their spending. The Chinese government continues to rebalance the country\u2019s economic model with tightening real estate and environmental regulation.\nIn addition, we work with some suppliers located in China to obtain certain components for our products. The United States government has recently announced import tariffs on goods manufactured in China. These tariffs, depending upon the\nultimate scope, duration and how they are implemented, could negatively impact our business by continuing to increase our costs and by making our products less competitive. We may not be able to pass such increased costs on to our customers. In addition, any changes to suppliers outside of China may increase our costs and could impact the global competitiveness of our products. We sell U.S. origin products in the Chinese market and any tariffs on U.S. goods imposed by the Chinese government, depending upon the ultimate scope, duration and how they are implemented, could negatively impact our business by making our products less competitive in that market.\nWe face risks from currency fluctuations.\nGiven the significance of non-U.S. sales to our total revenue, we face a continuing risk from the fluctuation of the U.S. dollar versus foreign currencies. Although the majority of our receivables are invoiced and collected in U.S. dollars, we have exposure from non-U.S. dollar-denominated sales (consisting primarily of the Euro, British pound sterling, and Chinese renminbi). We have a substantial number of international employees and facilities, resulting in material operating expenses denominated in foreign currencies. We have exposure from non-U.S. dollar-denominated operating expenses in foreign countries (primarily the Euro, British pound sterling, Israeli shekel, and Indian rupee).\nWe can benefit from or be adversely affected by either a weaker or stronger U.S. dollar relative to major currencies worldwide with respect to our consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, we can benefit from a stronger U.S. dollar due to the corresponding reduction in our foreign operating expenses translated into U.S. dollars and at the same time we can be adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar due to the corresponding reduction in foreign revenue translated into U.S. dollars. From time to time we have hedged our operating expense exposure in Indian rupees. We did not have any foreign currency derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges as of December 31, 2018.\nWe hedge balance sheet remeasurement exposures using forward contracts not designated for hedge accounting treatment with notional amounts of $191.8 million as of December 31, 2018. Forward contracts not designated as hedging instruments consist of hedges of Australian dollars, British pounds sterling, Canadian dollars, Chinese renminbi, Euro, Israeli shekel, and Japanese yen. Please refer to Note 11 - Derivatives and Hedging of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had not entered into hedges against any other currency exposures, but we may consider hedging against movements in other currencies in the future. Our efforts to reduce risk from our international operations and from fluctuations in foreign currencies or interest rates may not be successful, which could harm our financial condition and operating results.\nWe face risks from our international operations.\nWe are subject to certain risks because of our international operations including:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on our ability to access cash generated by international operations, especially in China and Brazil, due to restrictions on the repatriation of dividends, distribution of cash to shareholders outside such countries, foreign exchange control, and other restrictions;\n\u2022\nsecurity concerns, such as armed conflict and civil or military unrest, crime, political instability, and terrorist activity;\n\u2022\ncustomer credit risk, especially in emerging or economically challenged regions, with accompanying challenges to enforce our legal rights should collection issues arise;\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulation, including labor regulations, and our inability or failure to obtain required approvals, permits, or registrations could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenue, business, and operations;\n\u2022\nviolations of governmental regulation, including labor regulations, could result in fines and penalties, including prohibiting us from exporting our products to one or more countries, and could materially adversely affect our business;\n\u2022\ntrade legislation in either the U.S. or other countries, such as a change in the current tariff structures, export compliance laws, or other trade policies, could adversely affect our ability to sell or manufacture in international markets;\n\u2022\nadverse tax consequences, including imposition of withholding or other taxes on payments by subsidiaries, and\n\u2022\nsome of our sales to international customers are made under export licenses that must be obtained from the U.S. Department of Commerce (\u201cDOC\u201d) and certain transactions require prior approval of the DOC or other governmental agencies.\nWe incur additional legal compliance costs associated with our international operations and could become subject to legal penalties in foreign countries if we do not comply with local laws and regulations, which may be substantially different from those in the U.S. In many foreign countries, particularly those with developing economies, it may be common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by U.S. regulations such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors, and agents, as well as outsourced business operations, including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws may be customary, will not take actions in violation of our policies. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that employees, contractors, and agents of acquired companies did not take actions in violation of such laws and regulations prior to the date they were acquired by us, although we perform due diligence procedures to endeavor to discover any such actions prior to the acquisition date.\nWe license software used in most of our Fiery products and certain Productivity Software products from Adobe and the loss of these licenses would prevent shipment of these products.\nWe are required to obtain separate licenses from Adobe for the right to use Adobe PostScript\u00ae software in each copier or printer model that uses a Fiery DFE, and other Adobe software for certain Productivity Software products. Although to date we have successfully obtained licenses to use Adobe PostScript \u00ae and other Adobe software when required, Adobe is not required to, and we cannot be certain that Adobe will, grant future licenses to Adobe PostScript\u00ae and other Adobe software on reasonable terms, in a timely manner, or at all. To obtain licenses from Adobe, Adobe requires that we obtain quality assurance approvals from them for our products that use Adobe software. Although to date we have successfully obtained such quality assurance approvals from Adobe, we cannot be certain they will grant us such approvals in the future. If Adobe does not grant us such licenses or approvals, if the Adobe licenses are terminated, or if our relationship is otherwise materially impaired, we would likely be unable to sell products that incorporate Adobe PostScript \u00ae or other Adobe software and our financial condition and results of operations would be significantly harmed.\nWe manufacture super-wide and wide format industrial digital inkjet printers and formulate UV curable, LED curable, and reactive dye ink in single locations. Any significant interruption in the manufacturing process at these facilities could adversely affect our business.\nOur VUTEk hybrid super-wide and wide format industrial digital inkjet printers are primarily manufactured in a single location in our Manchester, New Hampshire facility. Our VUTEk roll-to-roll super-wide format industrial digital inkjet printers are manufactured in a single location in our Rosh Ha\u2019Ayin, Israel facility. Our FabriVU and other Reggiani industrial digital inkjet textile printers are manufactured in a single location in our Bergamo, Italy facility. Our Cretaprint ceramic tile decoration and Nozomi corrugated packaging digital inkjet printers are manufactured in a single location in our Castellon, Spain facility. We formulate our UV curable and LED curable digital ink that is used in our display graphics super-wide and wide-format industrial digital inkjet printers in a single location in our Ypsilanti, Michigan facility. We formulate our reactive dye ink that is used in our textile digital inkjet printers in a single location in our Bedford, U.K., facility. Any significant interruption in the manufacturing process at any of these facilities could affect the supply of our products, our ability to meet customer demand, and our ability to maintain market share.\nWe are developing contingency plans utilizing our manufacturing facilities in multiple locations and the capabilities of certain contract manufacturers in the event of a significant interruption in the manufacturing process at any of the aforementioned facilities. Until those plans are complete, disruptions in the manufacturing process at any of our sole source internal facilities could adversely affect our business.\nWe depend on a limited group of suppliers for key components in our products. The loss of any of these suppliers, the inability of any of these suppliers to meet our requirements, or delays or shortages of supply of these components, could adversely affect our business.\nCertain components necessary for the manufacture of our products are obtained from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers. These include CPUs, chip sets, ASICs, and other related semiconductor components; inkjet print heads for our industrial inkjet printers; branded textile ink; and certain key ingredients (primarily pigments and photoinitiators) for our digital UV curable ink. We generally do not maintain long-term agreements with our component suppliers and conduct business with such suppliers largely on a purchase order basis. If we are unable to continue to procure these sole or limited sourced components from our current suppliers in the required quantities, we will have to qualify other sources, if possible, or redesign our products. If we were unable to obtain the branded textile ink or the pigments required for our digital UV curable ink, we would have to qualify other sources, if possible, or reformulate and test the new ink formulations. These suppliers may be concentrated within similar industries or geographic locations, which could potentially exacerbate these risks. We cannot provide assurance that other sources of these components exist or will be willing to supply us on reasonable terms or at all, or that we will be able to design around these components. Any unavailability, delays, or shortages of these components or any inability of our suppliers to meet our requirements, could harm our business.\nBecause the purchase of certain key components involves long lead times, in the event of unanticipated volatility in demand for our products, we have in the past been, and may in the future be, unable to manufacture certain products in a quantity sufficient to meet current demand. Further, as has occurred in the past, in the event that anticipated demand does not materialize, we may hold excess quantities of inventory that could become obsolete. To meet projected demand, we maintain an inventory of components for which we are dependent on sole or limited source suppliers and components with prices that fluctuate significantly. As a result, we are subject to risk of inventory obsolescence, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nMarket prices and availability of certain components, particularly memory subsystems and Intel-designed components, which collectively represent a substantial portion of the total manufactured cost of our products, have fluctuated significantly in the past. Such fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition including reduced gross profit.\nWe are dependent on a limited number of subcontractors, with whom we generally do not have long-term contracts, to manufacture and deliver products to our customers. The loss of any of these subcontractors could adversely affect our business.\nWe subcontract with other companies to manufacture certain of our products and we generally do not have long-term agreements with these subcontractors. While we closely monitor our subcontractors\u2019 performance, we cannot be assured that such subcontractors will continue to manufacture our products in a timely and effective manner. In the past, a weakened economy led to the dissolution, bankruptcy, or consolidation of some of our subcontractors, which decreased the available number of subcontractors. If the available number of subcontractors were to decrease in the future, it is possible that we would not be able to secure appropriate subcontractors to fulfill our demand in a timely manner, or at all, particularly if demand for our products increases.\nThe existence of fewer subcontractors may reduce our negotiating leverage, thereby potentially resulting in higher product costs. Financial problems resulting in the inability of our subcontractors to make or ship our products, could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. If we change subcontractors, we could experience delays in finding, qualifying, and commencing business with new subcontractors, which would result in delayed delivery of our products and potentially the cancellation of orders for our products.\nWe have outsourced our Fiery production with Avnet, FFPS production with Dell, FFPS sustaining engineering with HCL, ceramic ink formulation with subcontractors in China and Italy, and formulation of certain textile ink with third party branded suppliers. Certain Industrial Inkjet sub-assemblies and wide format printer products are manufactured in the U.S. and China. Should our manufacturers experience any inability, or unwillingness, to manufacture or deliver our products, then our business, financial condition, and operations could be harmed. Since we generally do not maintain long-term agreements with our manufacturers, any of our manufacturers could enter into agreements with our competitors that might restrict or prohibit\nthem from manufacturing our products or could otherwise lead to an inability to fill our orders in a timely manner. In such event, we may not be able to find suitable replacements, in which case our financial condition and operations would likely be harmed.\nWe may face increased risk of inventory obsolescence, excess, or shortages related to our Industrial Inkjet printers and ink.\nWe procure raw materials and internally manufacture our super-wide format, textile, and ceramic tile decoration industrial inkjet printers and formulate digital UV curable and reactive dye ink based on our sales forecasts. If we do not accurately forecast demand for our products, we may produce or purchase excess inventory, which may result in our inventory becoming obsolete. We might not produce the correct mix of products to match actual demand if our sales forecast is not accurate, resulting in lost sales. If we have excess printers, ink, or other products, we may need to lower prices to stimulate demand.\nOur ink products have a defined shelf life. If we do not sell our ink before the end of its shelf life, it will have to be written off. We have also experienced UV curable ink shortages in the past and may continue to experience such shortages in the future. UV curable ink shortages may require that we incur additional costs to respond to increased demand and overcome such shortages.\nIf we are not able to hire and retain skilled employees, we may not be able to develop and manufacture products, or meet demand for our products, in a timely fashion.\nWe depend on skilled employees, such as software and hardware engineers, quality assurance engineers, chemists, chemical engineers, and other technical professionals with specialized skills. We are headquartered in the Silicon Valley and have research and development employees in facilities in 15 U.S. locations. We also have research and development employees in facilities in India, Europe, Israel, the U.K., Brazil, and Canada. Competition has historically been intense among companies hiring engineering and technical professionals. In times of professional labor imbalances, it has in the past and is likely in the future, to be difficult to locate and hire qualified engineers and technical professionals and to retain these employees. There are many technology companies located near our corporate offices in the Silicon Valley and our operations in India that may attempt to hire our employees.\nThe movement of our stock price may also impact our ability to hire and retain employees. If we do not offer competitive compensation, we may not be able to recruit or retain employees, which may have an adverse effect on our ability to develop products in a timely fashion, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe rely on our distribution channels to ensure sales growth.\nThe leading printer manufacturers, which comprise the majority of the customer base in our Fiery operating segment, are typically large profitable customers with little credit risk to us. Our Productivity Software and Industrial Inkjet operating segments sell primarily through a direct sales force, augmented by some select distributors, to a broader base of customers than Fiery. Any interruption of these distribution channels could negatively impact us in the future.\nSuccessfully managing the interaction of our direct and indirect channel efforts to reach various potential customer industries for our products and services is a complex process. For example, in response to our direct sales strategies or for other business reasons, our current distributors may choose to represent our competitors in place of us. In addition, from time to time we grant concessions to some of our distributors and allow them to return previously purchased products. Accordingly, reserves for estimated returns and exchanges are recorded as a reduction of revenues upon applicable product shipment, and are based upon our historical experience. Our reliance upon indirect distribution methods may reduce visibility to demand and pricing issues, and therefore make forecasting more difficult and, to the extent that returns exceed estimates, our revenues and operating results may be adversely affected.\nThe sales cycle for our products is long and we may incur substantial non-recoverable expenses or devote significant resources to sales that do not occur when anticipated.\nPotential or existing customers, particularly larger enterprise customers, generally commit significant resources to an evaluation of available products and require us to expend substantial time, effort and money educating them as to the value of our products and services. Sales of our products to these customers often require an extensive education and marketing effort.\nWe could expend significant funds and resources during a sales cycle and ultimately fail to win the customer. Our sales cycle for all our products and services is subject to significant risks and delays over which we have little or no control, including:\n\u2022\nour customer\u2019s budgetary constraints;\n\u2022\nthe timing of our customers\u2019 budget cycles and approval processes;\n\u2022\nour customers\u2019 willingness to replace their current print solutions;\n\u2022\nour need to educate potential customers about the uses and benefits of our products and services; and\n\u2022\nthe timing of the expiration of our customers\u2019 current outsourcing agreements for similar products and services.\nIf our sales cycles lengthen unexpectedly, they could adversely affect the timing of our revenues or increase costs, which may cause fluctuations in our quarterly revenues and results of operations. Finally, if we are unsuccessful in closing sales of our products after spending significant funds and management resources, our operating margins and results of operations could be adversely impacted, and the price of our common stock could decline.\nOur revenue for a particular period is difficult to predict, and a shortfall in revenue may harm our operating results.\nOur revenue for a particular quarter is difficult to predict, especially in light of a challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment and related market uncertainty. Our revenue may grow at a slower rate than in past periods or decline on a year-over-year basis. Our ability to meet financial expectations could also be adversely affected if the nonlinear sales pattern seen in some of our past quarters recurs in future periods. We have experienced periods of time during which bookings have exceeded shipments or manufacturing issues have delayed shipments, leading to nonlinearity in shipping patterns. In addition to making it difficult to predict revenue for a particular period, nonlinearity in shipping can increase costs, because irregular shipment patterns result in periods of underutilized capacity and periods in which overtime expenses may be incurred, as well as in potential additional inventory management-related costs. In addition, to the extent that manufacturing issues and any related component shortages result in delayed shipments in the future, and particularly in periods in which our contract manufacturers are operating at higher levels of capacity, it is possible that revenue for a quarter could be adversely affected if such matters occur and are not remediated within the same quarter.\nThe timing of large orders can also have a significant effect on our business and operating results from quarter to quarter, primarily in the United States and in emerging countries. From time to time, we receive large orders that have a significant effect on our operating results in the period in which the order is recognized as revenue. The timing of such orders is difficult to predict, and the timing of revenue recognition from such orders may affect period to period changes in revenue. As a result, our operating results could vary materially from quarter to quarter based on the receipt of such orders and their ultimate recognition as revenue.\nInventory management remains an area of focus. We have experienced longer than normal manufacturing lead times in the past which have caused some customers to place the same order multiple times within our various sales channels and to cancel the duplicative orders upon receipt of the product, or to place orders with other vendors with shorter manufacturing lead times. Such multiple ordering (along with other factors) or risk of order cancellation may cause difficulty in predicting our revenue and, as a result, could impair our ability to manage parts inventory effectively. In addition, our efforts to improve manufacturing lead-time performance may result in corresponding reductions in order backlog. A decline in backlog levels could result in more variability and less predictability in our quarter-to-quarter revenue and operating results. In addition, when facing component supply-related challenges, we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations which in turn contributes to an increase in purchase commitments. Increases in our purchase commitments to shorten lead times could also lead to excess and obsolete inventory charges if the demand for our products is less than our expectations.\nWe plan our operating expense levels based primarily on forecasted revenue levels. These expenses and the impact of long-term commitments are relatively fixed in the short term. A shortfall in revenue could lead to operating results being below expectations because we may not be able to quickly reduce these expenses in response to short-term business changes.\nAny of the above factors could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results.\nGrowing market share in the Productivity Software and Industrial Inkjet operating segments increases the possibility that we will experience increased bad debt expense and increased accounts receivable.\nMany of the Productivity Software and Industrial Inkjet customers are smaller and potentially less credit worthy than the leading printer manufacturers that purchase from our Fiery segment. Our ceramic tile decoration digital inkjet customer base is primarily located in geographic regions, which have recently been subject to economic challenges, including southern Europe (primarily Spain and Italy) and emerging markets in APAC. Furthermore, if we increase the percentage of Productivity Software and Industrial Inkjet products that are sold internationally, it may be challenging to enforce our legal rights should collection issues arise. In addition, many of our Industrial Inkjet customers are requesting extended payment terms, and we have been granting them on a limited basis in response to our competitors offers. Due to these and other factors, growing Industrial Inkjet and Productivity Software market share may cause us to experience an increase in bad debt expense and an increase in days sales outstanding (\u201cDSOs\u201d).\nDSOs increased during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared with December 31, 2017, primarily due to higher DSO across our businesses, except for Fiery and the textile market. We calculate DSO by dividing net accounts receivable at the end of the quarter by revenue recognized during the quarter, multiplied by the total days in the quarter, which is a measure of the relationship between sales and accounts receivable.\nAcquisitions may result in unanticipated accounting charges or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations and result in difficulties assimilating and integrating operations, personnel, technologies, products, and information systems of acquired businesses.\nWe seek to develop new technologies and products from both internal and external sources. We have also purchased companies and businesses for the primary purpose of acquiring their customer base. As part of this effort, we have in the past made, and will likely continue to make, acquisitions of other businesses. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties integrating operations, employees, technologies, products, information systems, and the required focus of management attention, time, and effort to accomplish successful integration;\n\u2022\ninformation systems may be inadequate to operate the business of the acquired company until we are able to integrate the acquired business into our information technology system;\n\u2022\nintegration of acquired business into our information system may be delayed, which may limit our ability to manage the acquired business and implement financial and operational controls;\n\u2022\ninformation systems may be poorly maintained by the acquired business;\n\u2022\nrisk of entering markets in which we have little or no prior experience, or entering markets where competitors have stronger market positions;\n\u2022\npossible write-downs of impaired assets;\n\u2022\nchanges in the fair value of contingent consideration;\n\u2022\npossible restructuring of personnel or leased facilities;\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees of the acquired company;\n\u2022\npossible overruns (compared to expectations) relative to the expense levels and cash outflows of the acquired business;\n\u2022\nadverse reactions by customers, suppliers, or parties transacting business with the acquired company or us;\n\u2022\nrisk of negatively impacting stock analyst ratings;\n\u2022\npotential litigation or any administrative proceedings arising from prior transactions or prior actions of the acquired company;\n\u2022\ninability to protect or secure technology rights;\n\u2022\npossible overruns of direct acquisition and integration costs; and\n\u2022\nequity securities issued in connection with acquisitions may be dilutive to our existing stockholders unless mitigating actions are taken such as treasury stock purchases; alternatively, acquisitions made entirely or partially for cash reduce cash reserves.\nMergers and acquisitions of companies are inherently risky. We cannot provide assurance that previous or future acquisitions will be successful or will not harm our business, operating results, financial condition, or stock price.\nWe face risks relating to the potential impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets.\nWe complete a review of the carrying value of our goodwill and long-lived assets annually and, based on a combination of factors (i.e., triggering events), we may be required to perform an interim analysis.\nGiven the uncertainty of the economic environment and its potential impact on our business, there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions regarding the duration of any economic downturn, or the period or strength of any subsequent recovery, made for purposes of our goodwill impairment testing as of December 31, 2018 will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. If our assumptions regarding forecasted revenue or gross profit rates are not achieved, we may be required to record goodwill impairment charges in future periods relating to any of our reporting units, whether in connection with the next annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2019 or prior to that, if an interim triggering event were to occur. It is not possible to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or, if it does, whether such charge would be material. No goodwill impairment foreshadowing events have occurred as of December 31, 2018.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, management approved a plan to sell approximately 31.5 acres of land and two related manufacturing buildings located in Meredith, New Hampshire (\u201cMeredith facility\u201d). The fair value of the Meredith facility, based on expected sales proceeds less cost to sell, was estimated to be less than the carrying amount of the assets. As a result, we incurred an impairment loss of approximately $0.9 million in our consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold one of the buildings and associated land but the remaining building and land continue to be held-for-sale as of December 31, 2018. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we updated our analysis of the expected sales proceeds less cost to sell, and recognized an additional impairment charge of $0.3 million on the remaining Meredith facility. We may be required to record additional impairment charges or a loss on sale if the sales proceeds for the remaining Meredith facility do not meet our expectations. We may also need to record impairment charges if we decide to sell or dispose of other long-term assets.\nWe are currently subject to securities lawsuits and we may be subject to similar or other litigation in the future, which may divert management\u2019s attention and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe market price of our common stock declined significantly following our August 3, 2017 announcement concerning our assessment of the timing of recognition of revenue and the effectiveness of our current and historical disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting. Subsequently in August, a purported class action lawsuit was filed alleging, among other things, that we and certain of our officers violated federal securities laws by making allegedly false and misleading statements concerning our financial reporting, revenue recognition, internal controls, and disclosure controls and procedures, prior to our August 2017 announcement. The plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages on behalf of the putative class and an award of costs and expenses, including attorney\u2019s fees. In addition, later in August 2017, a shareholder derivative complaint was filed alleging, among other things, that certain of our officers and directors had breached fiduciary duties and had been unjustly enriched and had made allegedly false and misleading statements concerning our financial reporting, revenue recognition, internal controls, and disclosure controls and procedures. The complaint alleges that the Company has suffered damages and seeks an unspecified amount of damages, restitution, and declaratory and other relief.\nWe cannot predict the outcome of these lawsuits, and we may be subject to other similar litigation in the future. Monitoring and defending against legal actions, whether or not meritorious, is time-consuming for our management and detracts from our ability to fully focus our internal resources on our business activities. In addition, we may incur substantial legal fees and costs in connection with litigation. Although we maintain insurance coverage, recovery could be denied or prove to be insufficient. We are not currently able to estimate the possible cost to us from the currently pending lawsuits, and we cannot be certain how long it may take to resolve these matters or the possible amount of any damages that we may be required to\npay. We have not established any reserves for any potential liability relating to these or future securities lawsuits. It is possible that we could, in the future, incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages. A decision adverse to our interests on these actions could result in the payment of substantial damages and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, the uncertainty of the currently pending lawsuits could lead to more volatility in our stock price.\nWe are subject to numerous federal, state, and foreign employment laws and may face claims in the future under such laws.\nWe are subject to numerous federal, state, and foreign employment laws and from time to time face claims by our employees and former employees under such laws. There are no material claims pending or threatened against us under federal, state, or foreign employment laws, but we cannot be sure that material claims under such laws will not be made in the future against us, nor can we predict the likely impact of any such claims on us, or that, if asserted, we would be able to successfully resolve any such claims without incurring significant expense.\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary information and may incur expenses to defend our proprietary information.\nWe rely on copyright, patent, trademark, and trade secret protection, in addition to nondisclosure agreements, licensing, and cross-licensing arrangements to establish, maintain, and protect our intellectual property rights, all of which afford only limited protection. We have patents and pending patent applications in the U.S. and various foreign countries. There can be no assurance that patents will issue from our pending applications or from any future applications, or that, if issued, any claims allowed will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. Any failure to adequately protect our proprietary information could harm our financial condition and operating results. We cannot be certain that any patents that have been, or may in the future be issued to us, or which we license from third parties, or any other proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented. In addition, we cannot be certain that any rights granted to us under any patents, licenses, or other proprietary rights will provide adequate protection of our proprietary information.\nMany countries in which we derive revenue do not have comprehensive and highly developed legal systems, particularly with respect to the protection of intellectual property rights, which, among other things, can result in a prevalence of infringing products and counterfeit goods in certain countries, which could harm our business and reputation.\nAs different areas of our business change or mature, from time to time we evaluate our patent portfolio and decide to either pursue or not pursue specific patents and patent applications related to such areas. Choosing not to pursue certain patents, patentable applications, and failing to file applications for potentially patentable inventions, may harm our business by, among other things, enabling our competitors to more effectively compete with us, reducing potential claims we can bring against third parties for patent infringement, and limiting our potential defenses to intellectual property claims brought by third parties.\nLitigation has been, and may continue to be, necessary to defend and enforce our proprietary rights. Such litigation, whether or not concluded successfully, could involve significant expense and the diversion of our attention and other resources, which could harm our financial condition and operating results.\nWe face risks from third party claims of infringement and potential litigation.\nThird parties have claimed in the past, and may claim in the future, that our products infringe, or may infringe, their proprietary rights. Such claims have resulted in lengthy and expensive litigation in the past and could have a similar result in the future. Such claims and any related litigation, whether or not we are successful in the litigation, could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources, which could harm our financial condition and operating results. Although we may seek licenses from third parties covering intellectual property that we are allegedly infringing, we cannot assure that any such licenses could be obtained on acceptable terms, if at all.\nWe are subject to risk of loss due to fire or earthquakes, floods, or other natural disasters.\nWe use flammable materials in the digital UV curable and ceramic digital ink formulation process; therefore, we may be subject to risk of loss resulting from fire. We maintain insurance policies to cover losses caused by fire, including business interruption insurance. If one or more of our facilities is damaged or otherwise ceases operations as a result of fire, it would reduce our digital UV curable and ceramic digital ink manufacturing capacity, which may reduce revenue and adversely affect our business.\nOur corporate headquarters, including a significant portion of our research and development facilities, are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, which is known for seismic activity. This area has also experienced flooding in the past. Many of the components necessary for our products are purchased from suppliers based in areas that are subject to risk from natural disasters, including the San Francisco Bay Area, China, and Japan. A significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, flood, tsunami, hurricane, typhoon, or other business interruptions due, for example, to power shortages and other interruptions have harmed our business, financial condition, and operating results in the past and could do so again in the future.\nWe may be subject to environmental-related liabilities due to our use of hazardous materials and solvents.\nOur business operations involve the use of certain hazardous materials at certain of our locations. We formulate UV curable, reactive dye, and ceramic ink at certain locations and store UV curable, ceramic, solvent, and thermoforming ink, as well as a variety of textile ink including dye sublimation, pigmented, reactive dye, acid dye, and water-based dispersed printing ink at certain locations. Our outsourced partners in China and Italy formulate our ceramic solvent-based ink. The solvents used in ceramic digital ink formulation have low volatility and flammability by design. As a result, ceramic digital ink poses less environmental risk compared with true solvent ink. We launched internal formulation of reactive dye ink during 2016 at our facility in Bedford, U.K. Reactive dye is a water-based dye.\nThe hazardous materials and solvents that we use are subject to various governmental regulations relating to their transfer, handling, packaging, use, and disposal. We store ink at warehouses worldwide, including Europe, China, Israel, the U.K., and the U.S., and shipping companies distribute ink at our direction. We face potential liability for problems such as large spills or fires that may arise at ink manufacturing locations. While we customarily obtain insurance coverage typical for this kind of risk, such insurance may not be sufficient. If we fail to comply with these laws or an accident involving our ink waste or chemicals occurs, or if our insurance coverage is not sufficient, then our business and financial results could be harmed.\nFuture sales of our products could be limited if we do not comply with current and future environmental and chemical content regulations.\nWe believe that our products are currently compliant with RoHS, WEEE, REACH, and other regulations for the European Union as well as with China RoHS and other applicable international, U.S., state, and local environmental regulations. We monitor environmental compliance regulations to ensure that our products are fully compliant prior to the implementation of any potential new requirements. However, new unforeseen legislation could require us to re-engineer our products, complete costly analyses, or perform supplier surveys, which could harm our business and negatively impact our financial results. We could also incur additional costs, sanctions, and liabilities in connection with non-compliant product recalls, regulatory fines, and exclusion of non-compliant products from certain markets.\nEnvironmental regulations and their enforcement have tightened in China, which has resulted in the closure of facilities without notice. Although such closures have not occurred with respect to our suppliers, the unexpected shutdown of supplier factories in China may impact our supply of raw material for digital inkjet ink. Some of our ceramic printing customers in China have experienced plant closures due to stricter environmental enforcement, which has impacted our sales of ceramic ink and may impact our sales in the future.\nOur products may contain defects, which are not discovered until after shipping, which could subject us to warranty claims in excess of our warranty reserves.\nOur products consist of hardware and software developed by ourselves and others, which may contain undetected defects. We have in the past discovered software and hardware defects in certain of our products after their introduction, resulting in warranty expense and other expenses incurred in connection with rectifying such defects or, in certain circumstances, replacing the defective product, which may damage our relationships with our customers. Defects could be found in new versions of our products after commencement of commercial shipment and any such defects could result in a loss or delay in market acceptance of such products and thus harm our reputation and revenue. Defects in our products (including defects in licensed third-party software) detected prior to new product releases could result in delays in the introduction of new products and the incurrence of additional expense, which could harm our operating results. We generally provide a thirteen-month hardware limited warranty commencing upon installation for certain Industrial Inkjet printers, which may cover both parts and labor. Our Fiery DFE limited warranty is 12 to 15 months.\nOur standard warranties contain limits on damages and exclusions, including but not limited to alteration, modification, misuse, mishandling, and storage or operation in improper environments. While we recorded an accrual of $12.8 million at December 31, 2018, for estimated warranty costs that are estimable and probable based on historical experience, we may incur additional costs of revenue and operating expenses if our warranty provision does not reflect adequately the cost to resolve or repair defects in our products or if our liability limitations are declared enforceable, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nActual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could adversely affect our revenue or costs.\nMaintaining the security of our software and hardware products is an issue of critical importance to our customers and for us. There are individuals and groups who develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that could attack our products. Although we take preventive measures to protect our products, and we have a response team that is notified of high risk malicious events, these procedures may not be sufficient to mitigate damage to our products. Actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could lead some customers to seek to return products, reduce or delay future purchases, or purchase competitive products. Any actual security vulnerabilities in our products could require us to incur additional costs to eliminate the vulnerabilities. Customers may also increase their expenditures to protect their computer systems from attack, which could delay or reduce purchases of our products. Any of these actions or responses by customers could adversely affect our revenue.\nSystem failures, or system unavailability, could harm our business.\nWe rely on our network infrastructure, internal and external technology systems and websites for our operations, development, marketing, support, and sales activities. These systems are also subject to potential disruptions and acts of vandalism. Any event that causes failures or interruption in our hardware or software systems could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur business could be adversely impacted in the event of a failure of our information technology infrastructure or adversely impacted by a successful cyber-attack.\nWe have experienced cyber-security threats, threats to our information technology infrastructure and unauthorized attempts to gain access to our sensitive information. Prior cyber-attacks directed at us have not had a material impact on our business or financial results; however, this may not continue to be the case in the future. Cyber-security assessment analyses undertaken by us have identified and prioritized steps to enhance our cyber-security safeguards. We are in the process of implementing these recommendations. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that we will adequately protect our information or that we will not experience any future successful attacks. Due to the evolving nature of security threats, the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted, and we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our cyber-security protective measures, to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures or to make required notifications. In addition, we may be subject to litigation and financial losses. These costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means. Occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our operations, the services we provide to our customers, our financial results or our reputation; or such events could result in\nthe loss of competitive advantages derived from our research and development efforts or other intellectual property or early obsolescence of our products and services.\nOur stock price has been volatile historically and may continue to be volatile.\nThe market price for our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, the price of our common stock as reported on The Nasdaq Global Select Market ranged from a low of $23.01 to a high of $35.62. We expect our stock price to be subject to fluctuations as a result of a variety of factors, including factors beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in our quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u2022\nability to initiate or complete stock repurchase programs;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations or new products or services by our competitors or by us;\n\u2022\nannouncements relating to strategic relationships, acquisitions, or investments;\n\u2022\nannouncements by our customers regarding their businesses or the products in which our products are included;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates or other statements by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nany failure to meet security analyst expectations;\n\u2022\nchanges in the securities analysts\u2019 rating of our securities;\n\u2022\nterrorist attacks and the affects of military engagements or natural disasters;\n\u2022\ncommencement of litigation or adverse results of pending litigation;\n\u2022\nchanges in the financial performance and/or market valuations of other software and high technology companies; and\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic conditions.\nBecause of this volatility, we may fail to meet the expectations of our stockholders or of securities analysts from time to time and the trading price of our securities could decline as a result. The stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the trading prices of equity securities of many high technology companies. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Any negative change in the public\u2019s perception of high technology companies could depress our stock price regardless of our operating results.\nOur stock repurchase program could affect our stock price and add volatility.\nIn November 2015, our board of directors authorized $150 million for the repurchase of our outstanding common stock. This authorization was scheduled to expire on December 31, 2018. On September 11, 2017, the board of directors approved the repurchase of an additional $125 million for our share repurchase program commencing September 11, 2017 and ending December 31, 2018. At that time, $28.8 million remained available for repurchase under the 2015 authorization. The 2017 authorization thereby increased the repurchase authorization to $153.8 million of our common stock. As of December 31, 2018, we have completed purchases of $275 million under our authorized stock repurchase program which expired at the end of 2018.\nAny repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program could affect our stock price and add volatility. There can be no assurance that repurchases will be made at the best possible price. Potential risks and uncertainties also include, but are not necessarily limited to, the amount and timing of future stock repurchases and the origin of funds used for such repurchases. The existence of a stock repurchase program could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. Depending on market conditions and other factors, these repurchases may be commenced or suspended from time to time. Any such suspension could cause the market price of our stock to decline.\nOur profitability may be affected by unanticipated changes in our tax provisions, the adoption of new U.S. or foreign tax legislation, or exposure to additional income tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign countries. Intercompany transaction pricing can impact our tax liabilities. We are potentially subject to tax audits in various countries and tax authorities may disagree with our tax treatments, including intercompany pricing or other matters, and assess additional taxes. We regularly review the likely\noutcomes of these audits to determine whether our tax provisions are sufficient. However, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and the final assessments of these audits can have a material impact on our net income (loss).\nOur effective tax rate in the future may be impacted by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, new information discovered during the preparation of our tax returns, deemed repatriation of foreign earnings, and enactment of future U.S. and foreign tax legislative initiatives, such as tax reform legislation (\u201c2017 Tax Act\u201d) enacted on December 22, 2017 in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) or multi-jurisdictional actions to address \u201cbase erosion and profit-shifting\u201d by multinational companies. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, or OECD, issued a series of reports on October 5, 2015 recommending changes to numerous well-established tax principles. Many countries are beginning to implement legislation to align their international tax rules with these recommendations. These actions could adversely impact our effective tax rate.\nThe 2017 Tax Act may significantly impact our tax liabilities, current business deductions, and the U.S. taxation of income earned by our foreign subsidiaries. Many of the provisions significantly differ from prior U.S. tax law resulting in changes to tax reporting and potentially increasing tax liabilities incurred.\nIn December 2017, the 2017 Tax Act was enacted, which included a broad range of changes impacting businesses, including corporate tax rates, business deductions, and international tax provisions. Many of the provisions significantly differ from previous U.S. tax law.\nThe 2017 Tax Act also will also significantly impact current and future tax liabilities including, but not limited to the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, a minimum tax to address base erosion and profit shifting from the U.S., the elimination of U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries, a new tax on global intangible low-tax income (\u201cGILTI\u201d), a limitation of deductible interest expense, and the repeal of the domestic production activity deduction. There are additional limitations imposed on the deductibility of certain executive compensation, the use of foreign tax credits to reduce U.S. income tax liabilities, and the utilization of net operating losses generated after December 31, 2017. Final regulations have not been issued to interpret many provisions of the 2017 Tax Act. These regulations, when issued, may have an adverse effect to our financial results.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of our 0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2019 (\u201c2019 Notes\u201d) and 2.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (\u201c2023 Notes\u201d and together with the 2019 Notes, the \u201cNotes\u201d) in cash, repay the Notes at maturity, or repurchase the Notes upon a fundamental change.\nIn September 2014, we completed a private placement of $345 million principal amount of 2019 Notes and in November 2018, we completed a private placement of $150 million principal amount of the 2023 Notes. Holders of the Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, as described in Note 12 - Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nUpon conversion of the Notes, we will be required to make conversion payments in cash, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion, as described in Note 12-Debt of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Moreover, we will be required to repay the Notes in cash at their maturity, unless earlier converted or repurchased. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing when the Notes are to be repurchased, converted, or at their maturity.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the Notes is triggered, holders of Notes will be entitled to convert the Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock, we would be required to settle all or a portion of the conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. Even if holders do not elect to convert their Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the\noutstanding principal of the 2023 Notes as a current liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash (such as the Notes) could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) ASC 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options, requires us to separately account for the liability and equity components of the Notes that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects our non-convertible debt interest rate. Accordingly, the equity component of the Notes is included in additional paid-in capital within stockholders\u2019 equity in our Consolidated Balance Sheet and the value of the equity component is treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the Notes. As a result, we are required to recognize non-cash interest expense in our Consolidated Statement of Operations in current and future periods as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying value of the Notes to their principal amount over their term. We will report lower net income (loss) because ASC 470-20 requires interest to include both the current period\u2019s amortization of the original issue discount and the Notes\u2019 non-convertible interest rate. This could adversely affect our future consolidated financial results, the trading price of our common stock, and the trading price of the Notes.\nUnder certain circumstances, in calculating earnings per share, convertible debt instruments (such as the Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash are accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method. The effect of the treasury stock method is that the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes, if any, are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the Notes exceeds their principal amount. Under the treasury stock method, diluted earnings per share is calculated as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess were issued, if we elected to settle such excess in shares. We cannot be sure that accounting standards will continue to permit the use of the treasury stock method in the future. If we are unable to use the treasury stock method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes, if any, then our diluted consolidated earnings per share would be adversely affected.\nOur debt obligations may be a burden on our future cash flows and cash resources.\nOn January 2, 2019, we entered into a credit agreement (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) which provides for revolving commitments of up to $150 million (including up to $10 million for swing line loans and up to $25 million for letters of credit). The Credit Agreement also contains a feature permitting us, subject to certain requirements, to arrange with lenders for additional revolving commitments or term loans for up to an aggregate of $50 million. As of December 31, 2018, we had $345 million principal amount outstanding of the 2019 Notes and $150 million principal amount outstanding of the 2023 Notes. Our ability to repay the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, or to make cash payments in connection with any conversion of the Notes depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive, and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt, or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nOur Credit Agreement contains restrictions that could limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nOur Credit Agreement contains various covenants that could limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions under certain conditions. These covenants could limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments, acquisitions, loans and advances;\n\u2022\nsell assets or enter into sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make distributions or make other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nprepay other indebtedness;\n\u2022\nengage in certain transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\namend certain charter documents and material agreements relating to other indebtedness.\nA breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the Credit Agreement. In the event of a default under the Credit Agreement, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable. If our lenders accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we may not be able to repay our debt obligations. If we were unable to repay amounts due to the lenders under our credit facility, those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness.\nCertain provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated bylaws, and under Delaware law could delay or impair a change in control.\nCertain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of the Company deemed undesirable by our board of directors.

Our amended and restated bylaws do not allow stockholders to call special meetings and include, among other things, procedures for advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals, which may have the effect of delaying or impairing attempts by our stockholders to remove or replace management, to commence proxy contests, or to effect changes in control or hostile takeovers of the Company.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which imposes restrictions on certain transactions between a corporation and certain significant stockholders. These provisions could also have the effect of delaying or impairing the removal or replacement of management, proxy contests, or changes in control. Any provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws that has the effect of delaying or impairing a change in control of the Company could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could affect the price that certain investors may be willing to pay for our common stock.", "PERMNO": 77971, "SIC": 3577, "TIC": "EFII"}
