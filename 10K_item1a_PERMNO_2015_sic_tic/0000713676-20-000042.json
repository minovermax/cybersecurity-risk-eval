{"cik": "713676", "company": "PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-02", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nWe are subject to a number of risks potentially impacting our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. As a financial services company, certain elements of risk are inherent in what we do and the business decisions we make. Thus, we encounter risk as part of the normal course of our business, and we design risk management processes to help manage these risks.\nOur success is dependent on our ability to identify, understand and manage the risks presented by our business activities so that we can appropriately balance revenue generation and profitability. We discuss our principal risk management oversight and processes and, in appropriate places, related historical performance and other metrics in the Risk Management section included in Item 7 of this Report.\nThe following are the key risk factors that affect us. Any one or more of these risk factors could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, these risks present other possible adverse consequences, including those described below. These risk factors and other risks we face are also discussed further in other sections of this Report.\n14 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. - 2019 Form 10-K\nRisks Related to the Economy and Other External Factors, Including Regulation\nOur business and financial performance are vulnerable to the impact of adverse economic conditions.\nAs a financial services company, our business and overall financial performance are affected to a significant extent by economic conditions, primarily in the U.S. The U.S. currently is in a prolonged economic expansion. This is not likely to continue forever, and at some point economic conditions are likely to turn recessionary.\nDeclining or adverse economic conditions generally result in reduced business activity, which may decrease the demand for our products and services. The ability of borrowers to repay loans is often weakened as a result of economic downturns. Such economic conditions also may lead to turmoil and volatility in financial markets, often with at least some financial asset categories losing value. Any of these effects would likely have an adverse impact on financial institutions such as PNC, with the significance of the impact generally depending on the nature and severity of the adverse economic conditions.\nEven when economic conditions are relatively good or stable, specific economic factors can negatively affect our business and performance. This can be especially true when the factors relate to particular segments of the economy. For example, shifting consumer behavior with respect to retail purchases being made over the internet rather than in physical stores has negatively impacted performance by some retailers. This likely decreases demand for financial services in that sector, possibly harming the creditworthiness of some shopping mall operators and retail companies with whom we do business. As another example, trade tensions leading to increased tariffs likely adversely affect companies that are relatively dependent on imports or exports. Increased tariffs may also result in increased prices for some products or services, leading to decreases in demand. Here, as well, affected companies may experience lower levels of business and possible declining creditworthiness. Recently increased tariffs on imports into, as well as exports out of, the U.S. have had, at least to some extent, a negative impact on the U.S. economy.\nGiven the geographic scope of our business and operations, we are most exposed to issues within the U.S. economy and financial markets. Within the U.S., we are most exposed to issues within markets located in the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest and Southeast. This will likely continue to be the case for at least some period of time, even as we expand the national reach of our businesses.\nOur foreign business activities continue to be a relatively small part of our overall business. As a result, the direct impact on our business and performance from economic conditions outside the U.S. is not likely to be significant, although the impact would increase if we expand our foreign business more than nominally. We are, however, susceptible to the risk that such economic conditions could negatively affect our business and financial performance. Primarily, this risk results from the possibility that poor economic conditions or financial market disruptions affecting other major economies would also affect the U.S. Currently, the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union, so-called \u201cBrexit,\u201d which became effective January 31, 2020 with a transition period through the end of 2020, has led to uncertainty regarding the impact on the economy and capital markets of the United Kingdom and throughout Europe more generally. The extent of the impact of Brexit will depend in part on transitional activities, including replacement trade agreements with the European Union, as to which uncertainties remain even after Brexit was finalized. The more severe the overall impact, the more likely it would have adverse effects on PNC and its business. PNC is also vulnerable to the impact of Brexit on PNC\u2019s customers with significant business or operations in the United Kingdom or elsewhere in the European Union. Another example is the current coronavirus outbreak originating in China. To the extent that this disease impacts business activity in China or other parts of the world where it spreads, it could adversely affect our customers dependent on the economy of China or other affected areas, even if it does not reach epidemic levels in the U.S.\nThroughout the remainder of this Risk Factors section, we address specific ways in which economic issues could create risk for us and result in adverse impacts on our business and financial performance.\nThe impact of government legislation, regulation and policy and other political factors on the economy could have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance.\nChanges in law or governmental policy affecting the economy, business activity, or personal spending, investing or saving activities may cause consumers and businesses to alter behavior in ways that impact demand for our products and services. Such changes may also alter the profitability of the transactions in which we engage. PNC may alter the types or terms of the products and services we offer to reflect such changes. Uncertainty regarding future law or policy may have similar impacts. Future changes in composition of Congress or in the identity of the President may create such uncertainty, as such changes often lead to changes in law or policy.\nConcern regarding the ability of Congress and the President collectively to reach agreement on federal budgetary matters (including the debt ceiling), or prolonged stalemates leading to total or partial governmental shutdowns, also can have adverse economic consequences and create the risk of economic instability or market volatility, with potential adverse consequences to our business and financial performance. Divided control of the U.S. government, which has been the case since the 2018 elections and may continue to be the case following the 2020 elections, may increase concern over the inability of Congress and the President to reach necessary agreements or make government shutdowns more likely.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. - 2019 Form 10-K 15\nThe policies of the Federal Reserve and other governmental agencies have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance, which are important to our business and financial performance.\nThe monetary policies of the Federal Reserve have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance. These policies can thus affect the activities and results of operations of financial companies such as PNC. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to monitor the national supply of bank credit and set certain interest rates. The actions of the Federal Reserve influence the rates of interest that we charge on loans and that we pay on borrowings and interest-bearing deposits. Rates of interest can also affect the value of our on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments. We cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary policies or the precise effects that they may have on our activities and financial results.\nIn addition, monetary policy actions by governmental authorities in the European Union or other countries could have an impact on global interest rates, which could affect rates in the U.S. as well as rates on instruments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, any of which could have one or more of the potential effects on us described above.\nSome of the potential impacts on our business and results of governmental monetary policy are described in Risk Factors under the heading \u201cRisks Related to the Business of Banking.\u201d\nAs a regulated financial services firm, we are subject to numerous governmental regulations and comprehensive oversight by a variety of regulatory agencies and enforcement authorities. These regulations and the manner in which they are implemented can have a significant impact on our businesses and operations.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. is a bank holding company (BHC) and a financial holding company, with the Federal Reserve as its primary regulator. PNC Bank is a federally chartered bank, with the Office of Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) as its primary regulator. In addition, our businesses are subject to regulation by multiple other banking, consumer protection, securities and derivatives regulatory bodies. We are also subject to the jurisdiction of criminal and civil enforcement authorities.\nAs a result, we are subject to numerous laws and regulations involving both our business and organization, with multiple regulators or agencies having supervisory or enforcement oversight over aspects of our business. These laws, regulations and supervisory activities are intended to promote the safety and soundness of financial institutions, financial market stability, the transparency and liquidity of financial markets, and consumer and investor protection. In addition to regulation in the U.S., we are also to a limited extent subject to foreign regulation as a result of our business activities outside the U.S.\nApplicable laws and regulations restrict permissible activities and investments and require compliance with provisions designed to protect loan, deposit, brokerage, fiduciary, and other customers, and for the protection of customer information, among other things. We also are subject to laws and regulations designed to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and transactions with persons, companies or foreign governments designated by U.S. authorities.\nOver time, the scope of the laws and regulations affecting our businesses, as well as the number of requirements or limitations imposed by legislative or regulatory actions, has increased. Although recently there have been efforts to update some of the regulations affecting us, which has resulted in reductions in some regulatory burdens, we expect to continue to face substantial regulatory oversight for the foreseeable future. Legislative or regulatory actions can result in increased compliance costs, reduced business opportunities, or new requirements and limitations on how we conduct our business.\nThe Federal Reserve requires a BHC to act as a source of financial and managerial strength for its subsidiary banks. The Federal Reserve could require PNC to commit resources to PNC Bank when doing so is not otherwise in the interests of PNC or its shareholders or creditors.\nThe single counterparty credit limit (SCCL) rules adopted by the Federal Reserve requires that PNC limit its aggregate net credit exposure to any single unaffiliated counterparty, including BlackRock, to an amount that is no more than 25% of PNC\u2019s Tier 1 capital. PNC expects to manage its net credit exposure to BlackRock to maintain compliance with the SCCL.\nThe results of supervisory or examination activities by our regulators could result in limitations on our ability to engage in new activities or expand geographically. These activities also could result in significant fines, penalties, or required corrective actions, some of which could be expensive and difficult to implement. As we expand our product and service offerings into additional states or countries, we will face increases in state or foreign regulation affecting our operations. Different approaches to regulation by different jurisdictions could materially increase our compliance costs or risks of non-compliance.\nA failure to comply, or to have adequate policies and procedures designed to comply, with regulatory requirements and expectations exposes us to the risk of damages, fines and regulatory penalties and other regulatory or enforcement actions or consequences, such as limitations on activities otherwise permissible for us or additional requirements for engaging in new activities, and could also injure our reputation with customers and others with whom we do business.\n16 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. - 2019 Form 10-K\nWe expect new regulatory requirements or other initiatives to be pursued and implemented in the future. Such future regulatory requirements or initiatives could further increase our compliance costs and the risks associated with non-compliance and could affect our ability to pursue or take full advantage of some desirable business opportunities.\nSee the Risk Factor headed \u201cWe are subject to regulatory capital and liquidity standards that affect our business, operations and ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders\u201d for a discussion of risks associated with capital and liquidity regulation. Also see Supervision and Regulation in Item 1 of this Report for more information concerning the regulation of PNC and recent initiatives to reform financial institution regulation, including some of the matters discussed in this Risk Factor. Note 18 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report also discusses some of the regulation applicable to us.\nWe are subject to regulatory capital and liquidity standards that affect our business, operations and ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders.\nPNC and PNC Bank are subject to regulatory capital and liquidity requirements established by the Federal Reserve and the OCC, respectively. These regulatory capital and liquidity requirements are typically developed at an international level by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) and then applied, with adjustments, in each country by the appropriate domestic regulatory bodies. Domestic regulatory agencies have the ability to apply stricter capital and liquidity standards than those developed by Basel Committee. In several instances, the U.S. banking agencies have done so with respect to U.S. banking organizations.\nRequirements to maintain specified levels of capital and liquidity, and regulatory expectations as to the quality of our capital and liquidity, impact our business activities and may prevent us from taking advantage of opportunities in the best interest of shareholders or force us to take actions contrary to their interests. For example, PNC\u2019s ability to pay or increase dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders is subject to the Federal Reserve\u2019s CCAR program. In addition, capital and liquidity requirements may impact the amount and type of loans we make. We may be constrained in our ability to expand, either organically or through acquisitions. We may be forced to sell or refrain from acquiring assets where the capital requirements appear inconsistent with the assets\u2019 underlying risks. In addition, liquidity standards require us to maintain holdings of highly liquid short-term investments, thereby reducing our ability to invest in longer-term or less liquid assets, even if more desirable from an earnings, balance sheet or interest rate risk management perspective.\nThe Basel Committee continues to engage in capital- and liquidity-related initiatives. For example, the Basel Committee in 2017 finalized additional, significant changes to the international capital framework for banking organizations. The changes would impact the market risk capital requirements for trading positions, the standardized risk weighting approach for credit risk and the measurement of operational risk. In addition, among other things, the changes would establish a standardized approach floor for capital ratios calculated by banking organizations that use the advanced approaches for the risk weighting of assets. Moreover, the Basel Committee continues to consider other changes to the international regulatory capital framework to enhance the transparency and consistency of capital requirements among banks and jurisdictions, including, among others, the treatment of securitization positions. As it is unclear, at this time, whether or how these initiatives will be implemented in the U.S., we are unable to estimate what potential impact such initiatives may have on us.\nThe liquidity standards applicable to large U.S. banking organizations also are expected to be supplemented in the coming years. For example, in May 2016, the U.S. banking agencies proposed rules to implement the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), which is designed to ensure that banking organizations maintain a stable, long-term funding profile in relation to their asset composition and off-balance sheet activities. The U.S. rules have not yet been finalized, and recent proposals would adjust the scope and effect of the originally-proposed U.S. rules. Thus, the potential impact of the NSFR on us remains unclear.\nRegulatory capital and liquidity requirements are subject to regular review and revision by the Basel Committee and the U.S. banking agencies. While the 2019 Tailoring Rules adjusted the capital and liquidity requirements applicable to PNC to better match our risk profile, future changes to the capital and liquidity rules may require PNC or PNC Bank to maintain more or higher quality capital or greater liquidity, which would likely increase some of the potential adverse effects described above.\nThe regulatory capital and liquidity frameworks as well as certain other prudential requirements and standards that are applicable to PNC are discussed in the Supervision and Regulation section included in Item 1 of this Report and the Liquidity and Capital Management portion of the Risk Management section of Item 7 of this Report.\nThe likely discontinuance of the submission of rates for the calculation of LIBOR presents risks to the financial instruments originated, held or serviced by PNC that use LIBOR as a reference rate.\nAs is the case with most large financial institutions, a significant portion of our transactions involve interest where the interest rate varies or adjusts over time. Variable or adjusting interest rates are calculated by adding a contractually defined credit spread to a base or reference rate. LIBOR is used as a reference rate for a substantial majority of our transactions involving variable or adjustable interest. Transactions tied to LIBOR include many of those in which we lend money, both to consumers and to businesses, or where\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. - 2019 Form 10-K 17\nwe issue securities or purchase and sell securities issued by others, as well as many derivative transactions that we enter into to manage our or our customers\u2019 risk. We also service financial instruments entered into by others that use LIBOR as the reference rate.\nLIBOR is derived from the rates at which LIBOR panel banks borrow from other global banks. Panel banks submit rate information to an administrator that uses this information to calculate LIBOR. The rates submitted by panel banks on which LIBOR is based reflect the credit risk associated with the submitting banks, and LIBOR is accordingly viewed as a \u201ccredit-sensitive\u201d rate. LIBOR is the subject of recent national and international regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. The United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the process for setting LIBOR, announced in July 2017 that it intends to no longer persuade or compel panel banks to submit rates to the administrator after 2021. Accordingly, we and others are preparing for the likelihood of LIBOR cessation at year end 2021.\nThere are ongoing efforts to establish one or more alternative reference rates to replace LIBOR assuming its cessation. If a rate does not achieve wide acceptance as the alternative to LIBOR, there likely will be disruption to the markets relying on the availability of a broadly accepted reference rate. At present, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (or SOFR) is considered the most likely alternative reference rate suitable for replacing LIBOR for most types of transactions, including derivatives, but issues remain with respect to its implementation. SOFR is derived from rates on overnight US Treasury repurchase or \u201crepo\u201d transactions, which are like overnight loans secured by U.S. Treasury bonds and is viewed as \u201criskless\u201d. In other words, SOFR does not reflect credit risk as the underlying transactions are secured by U.S. Treasury securities. In addition, disruptions in that repo market may lead to some volatility in SOFR even when credit quality is stable. Although SOFR is a relatively new rate, there is historical information with respect to analogs to SOFR, and extrapolations regarding how SOFR may behave in the future are available.\nChanging to SOFR or another riskless rate will contribute to the value transfer risk due to the differences in how riskless and credit-sensitive rates like LIBOR behave. Historically, in periods of economic or financial industry stress, riskless rates that are analogous to SOFR have been relatively stable. In contrast, LIBOR, which is designed to reflect the credit risk of banks, has widened relative to riskless rates, reflecting increased uncertainty regarding the credit-worthiness of banks. Accordingly, assuming that SOFR will behave like its historical analogs, an instrument that transitions from LIBOR to SOFR may not yield identical economic outcomes for each contracting party to an instrument had the instrument continued to reference LIBOR. Similarly, SOFR, because it is riskless, tends to be a lower rate than LIBOR.\nWhen an instrument that uses LIBOR as a reference rate transitions to a new reference rate, there will likely often be value transfer between us and the other contracting parties to that instrument (such as borrower, derivative counterparty, or bond holder). Impacts from a change in reference rate would likely include changes to the yield on and value of loans or securities held by us, amounts paid on securities we have issued, amounts received and paid on derivative instruments we have entered into and the trading market for LIBOR-based securities. Depending on the extent and direction of these changes, they could be financially adverse or beneficial to us or to our counterparties. Any theoretical benefit to us could result in counterparty dissatisfaction, which, in turn could lead to litigation or other adverse consequences. As a result, over the life of a transaction that transitions from LIBOR to a new reference rate, our monetary obligations to our counterparty (or their obligations to us) and the yield we receive (or pay) from the transaction with that counterparty may change from that which would have resulted from a continuation of LIBOR.\nTransitioning to a replacement rate will likely require an adjustment to contractual credit spreads (the amount added to the reference rate to determine the actual applicable interest rate) so that the new interest rate approximates the LIBOR-based rate. As the replacement reference rate will likely behave differently over time compared with LIBOR, it is likely that an adjusted credit spread that effectively results in a comparable interest rate to a LIBOR-based rate at some points in time will not do so at others.\nAnother set of risks associated with LIBOR cessation relates to how the transition from LIBOR to another rate will be effected. For some instruments, the method of transitioning to a new reference rate may be challenging. The challenges will be particularly acute where the contract does not provide for a transition on LIBOR cessation or the relevant contractual language relating to a potential transition is ambiguous or inadequate under the circumstances. Absent legislative solutions, where the contract does not appropriately provide for transition, we may seek to negotiate with impacted counterparties or, if not possible, affect reference rate transition through other means. Affecting transition under these circumstances may be challenging or ineffective and in some cases may involve concession on our part that has the effect of reducing the value of the instrument to us.\nFor instance, the vast majority of LIBOR-based interest rate swap derivative contracts do not currently contemplate the possibility that LIBOR will cease to exist. The International Swaps and Dealer Association (ISDA), the industry trade group for swaps, intends to issue new industry standard definitions that will contemplate the possibility of LIBOR cessation. These new definitions will establish the fallback rate, which is expected to be SOFR, as well as address, among other things, how to determine the credit spread adjustment when a LIBOR-based swap transitions to SOFR. Once effective, these definitions will apply to all newly executed derivatives contracts. ISDA intends to publish \u201cprotocols\u201d pursuant to which industry participants can agree with any other industry participant that adheres to the protocols to adopt these new definitions into legacy derivatives contracts. While these protocols are likely to be widely adopted among active swap industry participants, it is possible that many \u201cend users\u201d of swaps, i.e., our borrowers who have\n18 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. - 2019 Form 10-K\nhedged their interest rate payment obligations, may not adhere to these protocols. For these end-user counterparties, one-on-one negotiation with each counterparty will be necessary in order to amend legacy swaps to address LIBOR cessation. If we are unable to agree to appropriate LIBOR cessation provisions with these swaps counterparties, there will be uncertainty as to how to value and effect our rights and obligations under our legacy swap contracts.\nWe have other contracts that also do not contemplate LIBOR cessation. Still other contracts do contemplate cessation but do so in a manner that may create other risks. For example, some provide for selecting replacement rates in a manner that presents significant challenges (such as by assuming that there would be a rate calculated substantially in the same manner as LIBOR is) or that gives us or another party absolute discretion to select a rate. Some provide for determination of a reference rate without providing for adjustment of the credit spread. In these types of cases, there will likely be uncertainty surrounding transition, with all of the risks described in this Risk Factor.\nIn connection with implementing the transition from LIBOR to alternative rates, there is a possibility of operational errors occurring during the transition such that the replacement rate is not applied in a timely manner or is incorrectly applied. This is particularly true given the volume of contracts that will require transition and the diversity of potential approaches to transition and given the possibility that the period during which the transition will need to take place may have a short duration.\nThe potential issues associated with the transition from LIBOR to another reference rate create the risk of dissatisfied customers or of impaired relationships with financial institution counterparties. This could result from a perception that the value transfer likely to occur as a result of transition from LIBOR to another rate favors PNC. It could also arise through disagreements as to the resolution of contractual issues related to the transition, including where the transition involves the use of discretion on our part, or the failure to come to terms on an appropriate replacement rate if necessary. In addition to the risk of loss of business in these circumstances, customers or other counterparties unhappy with the transition could bring lawsuits, potentially as class actions, against us, creating the risk of substantial damages as well as high litigation defense costs.\nSimilarly, our failure to successfully implement transition from LIBOR to alternative rates could result in regulatory scrutiny and actions by our regulators including fines and other supervisory sanctions.\nWhile we expect LIBOR to continue to be available in substantially its current form until the end of 2021 or shortly before that, it is possible that LIBOR quotes will become unavailable prior to that point. This could result, for example, if a sufficient number of panel banks decline to make submissions to the LIBOR administrator. In that case, the risks associated with the transition to an alternative reference rate will be accelerated and magnified. These risks may also be increased due to the shorter time for preparing for the transition.\nIn order to address LIBOR cessation and the associated risks, we have established an enterprise LIBOR transition program, described in the Market Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section in Item 7 of this Report. Any failure of this program to appropriately assess and mitigate risk and deliver in a timely manner on operationalizing our ability to transition from LIBOR could magnify the risks previously outlined.\nNew customer privacy initiatives will impose additional operational burdens on PNC, may limit our ability to pursue desirable business initiatives and increase the risks associated with any future use of customer data.\nRecently there has been an increase in legislative and regulatory efforts to protect the privacy of consumer data. Significant examples include the General Data Protection Regulation of the European Union and the California Consumer Privacy Act. These initiatives, among other things, limit how companies can use customer data and impose obligations on companies in their management of such data. Financial services companies such as PNC necessarily gather, maintain and use a significant amount of customer data. These types of initiatives increase compliance complexity and related costs, result in significant financial penalties for compliance failures, and limit our ability to develop new products or respond to technological changes. Such legal requirements also could heighten the reputational impact of perceived misuses of customer data by us, our vendors, or others who gain unauthorized access to our customer data. Other jurisdictions may adopt similar requirements that impose different and potentially inconsistent compliance burdens. The impacts will be greater to the extent requirements vary across jurisdictions.\nSocietal responses to climate change could adversely affect our business and performance, including indirectly through impacts on our customers.\nConcerns over the long-term impacts of climate change have led and will continue to lead to governmental efforts around the world to mitigate those impacts. Consumers and businesses also are changing their behavior as a result of these concerns. PNC and its customers will need to respond to new laws and regulations as well as consumer and business preferences resulting from climate change concerns. We and our customers may face cost increases, asset value reductions, operating process changes, and the like. The impact on our customers will likely vary depending on their specific attributes, including their reliance on or role in carbon intensive activities as well as their exposure to the effects of climate change. Among the impacts to PNC could be a drop in demand for our\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. - 2019 Form 10-K 19\nproducts and services, particularly in certain sectors. In addition, we could face reductions in creditworthiness on the part of some customers or in the value of assets securing loans, or pressure from individuals or groups to cease doing business with certain companies or sectors. The Risk Factor headed \u201cWe are at risk for an adverse impact on our business due to damage to our reputation\u201d has further discussion of risks associated with activist pressure. Our efforts to take these risks into account in making lending and other decisions, including by increasing our business with climate-friendly companies, may not be effective in protecting us from the negative impact of new laws and regulations or changes in consumer or business behavior, including those resulting from activist pressure.\nRisks Related to the Use of Technology\nThe use of technology is critical to our ability to maintain or enhance the competitiveness of our businesses.\nAs a large financial services company, we handle a substantial volume of customer and other financial transactions. As a result, we rely heavily on information systems to conduct our business and to process, record and monitor our transactions and those of our customers. Over time, we have seen more customer usage of technological solutions for financial needs as well as higher expectations of customers and regulators regarding effective and safe systems operation. In many cases, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers. As a result of these factors, the financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. Examples include expanded use of cloud computing, artificial intelligence and machine learning, virtual and augmented reality, biometric authentication, voice and natural language, and data protection enhancements, as well as increased online and mobile device interaction with customers. We expect these trends to continue for the foreseeable future. Change is coming both from traditional banking companies and non-bank financial technology companies offering financial products and services, particularly payment services and lending. Our ability to succeed is dependent on the technologies we employ and offer our customers and the extent to which we at least keep pace with, if not exceed, our competitors\u2019 progress and our customers\u2019 needs and expectations.\nIn response to actual and anticipated customer behavior and expectations, as well as competitive pressures, we have been investing in technology and connectivity. We are seeking to automate functions previously performed manually, facilitate the ability of customers to engage in financial transactions, and otherwise enhance the customer experience with respect to our products and services. This effort has involved the expenditure of considerable amounts of funds and other resources. A failure to maintain or enhance our competitive position with respect to technology, whether because we fail to anticipate customer expectations or because our technological developments fail to perform as desired or are not rolled out in a timely manner or because we fail to keep pace with our competitors, would likely cause us to lose market share or incur additional expense. Our ability to maintain or enhance our relative technological position is in part dependent on our ability to attract and retain talented employees in these fields, which, due to overall demand, is increasingly difficult.\nOur use of technology is dependent on having the right to use the underlying intellectual property.\nIn some cases, we develop internally the intellectual property embedded in the technology we use. In others, we or our vendors license it from others. Regardless of the source of the intellectual property, if another person or entity were deemed to own intellectual property infringed by our activities, we could be responsible for significant damages covering past activities and substantial fees to continue to engage in these types of activities. It also is possible that we could be prevented from using technology important to our business for at least a period of time. In such a circumstance, there may be no alternative technology for us to use or an appropriate alternative technology might be expensive to obtain. Protections offered by those from whom we license technology against these risks may be inadequate to cover fully any losses. Over time, there have been instances where key technology used by PNC and other financial institutions has been alleged to have infringed patents held by others, and in some cases we, as well as other financial institutions, have suffered losses of the types described above.\nWe could suffer a material adverse impact from interruptions in the effective operation of our information systems and other technology.\nThe need to ensure proper functioning and resiliency of our information systems and other technology has become more important and more challenging, and the costs involved in that effort continue to be high. The risks of operational failures in the use of these systems result from a variety of factors. We are vulnerable to the impact of failures of our systems to operate as needed or intended. Failures leading to materially adverse impacts could include those resulting from human error, unexpected transaction volumes, or overall design or performance issues. In addition, our ability to use our technology effectively could be impacted due to bad weather, disasters, bad actors, terrorism and the like. Such events could affect our systems directly or limit our ability to use our technology due to effects on key underlying infrastructure. In some cases, the risk results from the potential for bad acts on the part of others, discussed in more detail in the Risk Factor headed \u201cWe are vulnerable to the risk of third party breaches of data security affecting the functioning of systems or the confidentiality of information, either at PNC or at third parties handling PNC information.\u201d\nWe also rely on information systems maintained by other companies. We use other companies both to provide products and services directly to us and to assist in providing products and services to our customers. Others provide the infrastructure that supports, for example, communications, payment, clearing and settlement systems, or information processing and storage. These companies range\n20 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. - 2019 Form 10-K\nfrom those providing highly sophisticated information processing to those that provide fundamental services, such as electric power and telecommunications. In some cases, these other companies themselves utilize third parties to support their delivery of products and services to us and our customers. Systems maintained by or for these other companies are generally subject to many of the same risks we face with respect to our systems and thus their issues could have a negative impact on PNC. We necessarily have less ability to provide oversight over other companies\u2019 information systems.\nA number of our customers choose to use financial applications (apps) that allow them to view banking and other financial account information, often held at different financial institutions, on a single platform, to monitor the performance of their investments, to compare financial and investment products, to make payments or transfer funds, and otherwise to help manage their finances and investments. Financial apps typically ask users to provide their secure banking log-in information and credentials (username and password) so the apps can link to users\u2019 accounts at financial institutions. Companies offering these apps frequently use third-party data aggregators - behind-the-scenes technology companies that serve as a data-gathering service provider - to deliver customer financial data that is used by the financial apps. To do this, data aggregators are provided with customers\u2019 log-in information and credentials, which allows the aggregators to access the customers\u2019 online account and \u201cscrape\u201d the customers\u2019 data, often on a daily basis. That same information has the potential to facilitate fraud if it is not properly protected. In fact, the Director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has stated that FinCEN has seen high incidences of fraud, including automated clearing house (ACH) fraud, credit card fraud, and wire fraud, enabled through the use of synthetic identities and through account takeovers via these platforms. In some cases, cybercriminals appear to be using such data aggregators and integrators to facilitate account takeovers and fraudulent wires. PNC could face increased financial exposure due to fraudulent activity associated with the increased use of these apps and data aggregators. Even where PNC does not have responsibility for fraud losses associated with these apps and data aggregators, PNC could suffer increased reputational harm when such losses occur.\nAlthough we regularly update and replace systems, both internal and third party, that we depend on as our needs evolve and technology improves, we continue to utilize some older systems that may not be as reliable as newer ones. In addition, the implementation of and transition to new or updated systems creates risks related to associated timing and costs, disruptions in functionality for customers and longer term failures to achieve desired improvements.\nThe occurrence of any failure, interruption or security breach of any of our information or communications systems, or the systems of other companies on which we rely, could result in a wide variety of adverse consequences to us. This risk is greater if the issue is widespread, extends for a significant period of time, or results in financial losses to our customers. The consequences of failures to operate systems properly can include disruptions to our ability to use our accounting, deposit, loan, payment and other systems. Such events could also cause errors in transactions or impair system functionality with customers, vendors or other parties. Possible adverse consequences also include damage to our reputation or a loss of customer business, which could occur even if the negative impact on customers was de minimis. We also could face litigation or additional regulatory scrutiny. This in turn could lead to liability or other sanctions, including fines and penalties or reimbursement of adversely affected customers. Even if we do not suffer any material adverse consequences as a result of events affecting us directly, information systems issues at other financial institutions could lead to a general loss of customer confidence in financial institutions, including us. Also, system problems, including those resulting from third party attacks, whether at PNC or at our competitors, would likely broadly increase legislative, regulatory and customer concerns regarding the functioning, safety and security of such systems. In that case, we would expect to incur even higher levels of costs with respect to prevention and mitigation of these risks.\nWe are vulnerable to the risk of third party breaches of data security affecting the functioning of systems or the confidentiality of information, either at PNC or at third parties handling PNC information.\nWe are faced with ongoing efforts by others to breach data security at financial institutions or with respect to financial transactions. The threat posed by these efforts is ever-present, with essentially continual attacks. Some of these involve efforts to enter our systems directly by going through or around our security protections. Others involve the use of social engineering schemes to gain access to confidential information from our employees, customers or vendors. Most corporate and commercial transactions are now handled electronically, and our retail customers increasingly use online access and mobile devices to bank with us. The ability to conduct business with us in this manner depends on the transmission and storage of confidential information in electronic form. As a result, efforts by bad actors to engage in various types of cyber attacks pose serious risks to our business and reputation. The same risks are presented by attacks potentially affecting information held by third parties on our behalf or accessed by third parties, including those offering financial apps, on behalf of our customers.\nIn the ordinary course, we maintain and process vast amounts of information about us, our customers and our employees. This information tends to be confidential or proprietary and much of it is highly sensitive. The highly sensitive information includes information sufficient to support identity theft and personal health information, as well as information regarding our business plans and financial performance that has not been made public. One way in which bad actors attempt to harm us is by seeking access to some of this confidential or proprietary information, often with the intent of stealing from or defrauding us or our customers. In other cases, they seek to disrupt our ability to conduct our business, including by destroying or impairing our access to information maintained by us.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. - 2019 Form 10-K 21\nOur customers often use their own devices, such as computers, smartphones and tablets, to do business with us and may provide their PNC customer information (including passwords) to a third party in connection with obtaining services from the third party, including those offering financial apps. Although we take steps to provide safety and security for our customers\u2019 transactions with us and their customer information to the extent they are utilizing their own devices or providing third parties access to their accounts, our ability to assure such safety and security is necessarily limited.\nAs our customers regularly use PNC-issued credit and debit cards to pay for transactions with retailers and other businesses, there is also the risk of data security breaches at those other businesses covering PNC account information. When our customers use PNC issued cards to make purchases from those businesses, card account information often is provided to the business. If the business\u2019s systems that process or store card account information are subject to a data security breach, holders of our cards who have made purchases from that business may experience fraud on their card accounts. We can be responsible for reimbursing our customers for such fraudulent transactions on customers\u2019 card accounts, as well as for other costs related to data security compromise events, such as replacing cards associated with compromised card accounts, but to date such losses have not been material to us. In addition, we provide card transaction processing services to some merchant customers under agreements we have with payment networks such as Visa and Mastercard. Under these agreements, we may be responsible for certain losses and penalties if one of our merchant customers suffers a data security breach.\nOver the last few years, several large companies disclosed that they had suffered substantial data security breaches compromising millions of user accounts and credentials. To date, our losses and costs related to these types of breaches, including those where some of the accounts affected were with PNC, have not been material. Other similar events in the future could be more significant to us. Moreover, to the extent more consumer confidential information becomes available to bad actors through the cumulative effect of data breaches at companies generally, bad actors may find it easier to use such information to gain access to our customer accounts.\nThere have been other recent publicly announced cyber attacks that were not focused on gaining access to credit card or user credential information but instead sought access to a range of other types of confidential information including internal emails and other forms of customer financial information. Ransomware attacks have sought to deny access to data and possibly shut down systems and devices maintained by target companies. In a ransomware attack, system data is encrypted or access is otherwise denied, accompanied by a demand for ransom to restore access to the data.\nA number of companies have fallen victim to business email compromise (BEC) scams in recent years. BEC scams involve using social engineering to cause employees to wire funds to the perpetrators in the mistaken belief that the requests were made by a company executive or established vendor. While we have not experienced material losses from BEC scams to date, some of our commercial customers have been victimized. Attacks on our customers may put these relationships at risk, particularly if customers\u2019 ability to continue operations is impaired due to the losses suffered.\nOther attacks in recent years have included distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, in which individuals or organizations flood commercial websites with extraordinarily high volumes of traffic with the goal of disrupting the ability of commercial enterprises to process transactions and possibly making their websites unavailable to customers for extended periods of time. We (as well as other financial services companies) have been subject to such attacks.\nIn addition to threats from external sources, insider threats represent a significant risk to us. Insiders, including those having legitimate access to our systems and the information contained in them, have the easiest opportunity to make inappropriate use of the systems and information. Addressing that risk requires understanding not only how to protect us from unauthorized use and disclosure of data, but also how to engage behavioral analytics and other tools to identify potential internal threats before any damage is done.\nTo date, none of these types of attacks have had a material impact on us. Nonetheless, we cannot entirely block efforts by bad actors to harm us. And our efforts to prevent significant harm from attacks may be insufficient. As a result, we could suffer material financial and reputational losses in the future from any of these or other types of attacks. Attacks on others, some of which have led to serious adverse consequences, demonstrate the risks posed by new and evolving types of cyber attacks. Our ability to protect confidential or proprietary information is even more limited with respect to information held by third parties. We may suffer reputational damage or legal liability for unauthorized access to customer information held by third parties, even if we were in fact not responsible for preventing such access and had no reasonable way of preventing it.\nWe need effective programs to limit the risk of failures or breaches occurring in our information systems and to mitigate the impact when they do.\nWe have policies, procedures and systems (including cyber security and business continuity programs) designed to prevent or limit the effect of possible failures, interruptions or breaches in security of information systems. In recent years, we have devoted significant resources towards improving the reliability of our systems and their security against external and internal threats. We design our business continuity and other information and technology risk management programs to manage our capabilities to provide services in the case of an event resulting in material disruptions of business activities affecting our employees, facilities, technology or suppliers. We regularly seek to test the effectiveness of and enhance these policies, procedures and systems. Where the risk relates to products or services provided by others, we seek to engage in due diligence and monitoring to limit the risk. Nonetheless, we cannot guarantee the\n22 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. - 2019 Form 10-K\neffectiveness of our policies, procedures and systems to protect us in any particular future situation, nor the effectiveness of our oversight of risk at third parties. Should an adverse event affecting another company\u2019s systems occur, we may not have financial protection from the other company sufficient to compensate us or otherwise protect us from the consequences.\nMethods used by others to attack information systems change frequently (with generally increasing sophistication). A new method of attack often is not recognized until launched against a target. Attacks in some cases appear to be supported by foreign governments or other well-financed entities and often originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world. As a result, we may be unable to implement adequate preventive measures to address these methods in advance of attacks.\nEven with our proactive and defensive measures in place, adverse events are likely to occur and there remains the risk that one or more such events would be material to PNC. Our ability to mitigate the adverse consequences of such occurrences is in part dependent on the quality of our business continuity planning, our ability to understand threats to us from a holistic perspective, and our ability to anticipate the timing and nature of any such event that occurs, with novel or unusual events posing a greater risk. It is also the case that an adverse event can go undetected for a period of time, with the adverse consequences likely greater the longer it takes to discover the problem. In many cases, it also depends on the preparedness and responses of national or regional governments, including emergency responders, or on the part of other organizations and businesses with which we deal.\nRisks Related to the Business of Banking\nOur business and financial results are subject to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our customers and counterparties.\nCredit risk is inherent in the financial services business. It results from, among other things, extending credit to customers, purchasing securities, and entering into financial derivative transactions and certain guarantee contracts. Credit risk is one of our most significant risks, particularly given the high percentage of our assets represented directly or indirectly by loans and securities and the importance of lending activity to our overall business. We manage credit risk by assessing and monitoring the creditworthiness of our customers and counterparties, by diversifying our loan portfolio and by investing primarily in high quality securities.\nA borrower\u2019s ability to repay a loan can be adversely affected by many factors. Individual borrowers can be affected, for example, by declines in income, job losses, health issues or family issues. Commercial borrowers can be affected, for example, by poor business performance or catastrophe losses. Weakness in the economy or in financial markets would typically adversely impact the ability of our borrowers to repay outstanding loans. Borrowers with higher leverage (that is, higher ratios of indebtedness to total capitalization or income) have an increased risk that they will be unable to repay loans, particularly when economic conditions worsen. We are exposed to credit risk when we fail to evaluate properly at origination the likely ability of a borrower to repay a loan. Overestimating the current and potential value of any collateral pledged to support the loan also adds to our credit risk. A failure to identify declining creditworthiness of a borrower or declining collateral value at a time when remedial actions could reduce our exposure also increases credit risk. Any decrease in our borrowers\u2019 ability to repay loans would result in higher levels of nonperforming loans, net charge-offs, provision for credit losses and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale. Managing credit risk effectively also relies on forecasts of future overall economic conditions, which are inherently imperfect. For several years, credit risk has been at low levels by historical standards. Recently, we have experienced some normalization of credit risk, although still at historically low levels. Continued normalization would adversely affect our results of operations, even if overall economic conditions and borrower creditworthiness remain strong.\nIn addition to credit risk associated with our lending activities, we have credit risk arising from many other types of business relationships. Routine transactions give us credit exposure to brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, other institutional clients, as well as vendors and other non-financial entities.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we often have heightened credit exposure to a particular industry, region or financial market. As an example, loans secured by commercial and residential real estate typically represent a significant percentage of our overall credit portfolio. They also represent a portion of the assets underlying our investment securities. Although there are limitations on the extent of total exposure to an individual or business borrower, we may have outsized exposure to a particular borrower experiencing financial distress. Events adversely affecting specific customers or counterparties, industries, regions or financial markets, including a decline in their creditworthiness or a worsening overall risk profile, could materially and adversely affect us. Declining economic conditions also may impact commercial borrowers more than consumer borrowers, or vice versa. The last recession, for example, impacted consumers, particularly with respect to residential mortgage loans, more than commercial borrowers. A future recession may have the opposite result. Thus, the mix of our loan portfolio may affect the severity of the impact of a future recession.\nOur credit risk may be exacerbated when collateral held by us to secure obligations to us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us.\nWe reserve for credit losses on our loan and lease portfolio through our allowance for credit losses. We also have reserves for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. Changes are reflected in net income through provision for credit losses. An increase in credit risk would likely lead to an increase in provision for credit losses with a resulting reduction in our net income and would increase our allowance.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. - 2019 Form 10-K 23\nEffective January 1, 2020, we adopted required changes in accounting for credit losses as a result of the Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL) standard. Implementation of these changes is likely to result in an increase in period-to-period volatility in the amounts we recognize as provision for credit losses with a corresponding increase in period-to-period volatility in our net income. It is also likely to reduce the comparability across banking companies due to, for example, different economic assumptions used in underlying models as well as differences in product mix. The impact of the adoption of CECL is described in more detail in Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.\nOur business and financial performance are impacted significantly by market interest rates and movements in those rates.\nAs a result of the high percentage of our assets and liabilities that are in the form of interest-bearing or interest-related instruments, changes in interest rates, in the shape of the yield curve, or in spreads between different market interest rates can have a material effect on our business, our profitability and the value of our financial assets and liabilities. For example:\n\u2022\nChanges in interest rates or interest rate spreads affect the difference between the interest that we earn on assets and the interest that we pay on liabilities, which impacts our overall net interest income and margin as well as our profitability.\n\u2022\nSuch changes can affect the ability of borrowers to meet obligations under variable or adjustable rate loans and other debt instruments, and can, in turn, increase our credit losses on those assets.\n\u2022\nSuch changes can decrease the demand for interest rate-based products and services, including loans and deposit accounts.\n\u2022\nSuch changes affect our hedging of various forms of market and interest rate risk and may decrease the effectiveness of those hedges in helping to manage such risks.\n\u2022\nMovements in interest rates also affect mortgage prepayment speeds and could result in impairments of mortgage servicing assets or otherwise affect the profitability of such assets.\n\u2022\nIncreases in interest rates likely lower the price we would receive on fixed-rate customer obligations if we were to sell them.\nThe rates on some interest-bearing instruments adjust promptly in accordance with changes in market rates, while others adjust only periodically or are fixed throughout a defined term. As a result, the impact of changes in interest rates can be either increased or diluted due to differences in the relative variability of the rates paid on our liabilities in relation to the rates received on our assets. The extent to which we have elected to hedge interest rate risk through interest rate swaps also affects the impact of rate changes. We attempt to manage the balance sheet to increase our benefit or reduce negative impacts from future movements in interest rates, but failures to anticipate actual movements may have the opposite result.\nWhile in general higher interest rates enhance our ability to grow our net interest income, there are risks associated with a rising interest rate environment. As a general matter, increasing rates tend to decrease the value of fixed rate financial instruments held on our balance sheet, as discussed in the Risk Factor headed \u201cOur business and financial performance are vulnerable to the impact of changes in the values of financial assets.\u201d Also, customers may be less willing overall to borrow at higher rates. Higher interest rates may indirectly affect the value of asset classes such as real estate typically financed through secured loans, with a resulting negative effect on collateral securing such loans. As another example, there may be increased competitive pressures as rates on deposit products rise. The benefits of higher interest rates are best achieved if we can increase the rates on loans and other assets faster than the rates on deposits and other liabilities increase. We may not be able to achieve this result in a rising rate environment.\nOn the other hand, lower interest rates tend to have a negative impact on our net interest margin and, unless compensated for by increases in interest-earning assets, on our net interest income.\nWe discuss the impact of governmental monetary policy on interest rates in the Risk Factor headed \u201cThe policies of the Federal Reserve and other governmental agencies have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance, which are important to our business and financial performance.\u201d\nOur business and financial performance are vulnerable to the impact of changes in the values of financial assets.\nAs a financial institution, a substantial majority of our assets and liabilities are financial in nature. Examples include loans, securities, servicing rights, deposits and borrowings. Such assets and liabilities will fluctuate in value, often significantly, due to movements in the financial markets or market volatility as well as developments specific to the asset or liability in question. Credit-based assets and liabilities will fluctuate in value due to changes in the perceived creditworthiness of borrowers or other counterparties and also due to changes in market interest rates.\nChanges in loan prepayment speeds, which often occur when interest rates change, impact the value of our mortgage servicing rights, possibly adversely. Also, the underlying value of assets under lease or securing an obligation generally decreases due to increases in supply or decreases in demand for the asset or deterioration in the condition of the asset. This could negatively impact the ability to collect fully on the secured obligation.\nIn many cases, we mark our assets and liabilities to market on our financial statements, either through Net income and Retained earnings or through adjustments to Accumulated other comprehensive income. We may need to record losses in the value of financial\n24 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. - 2019 Form 10-K\nassets even where our expectation of realizing the face value of the underlying instrument has not changed. Other assets and liabilities are not marked to market. As a result, our balance sheet may not precisely represent the fair market value of our financial assets and liabilities.\nIn addition, asset management revenue is earned primarily based on a percentage of the value of the assets being managed and thus is impacted by general changes in market valuations. Thus, although we are not directly impacted by changes in the value of such assets, decreases in the value of those assets would affect related Noninterest income.\nRisks Related to Estimates and Assumptions\nOur asset and liability valuations and the determination of the amount of loss allowances and impairments taken on our assets are highly subjective. Inaccurate estimates could materially impact our results of operations or financial position.\nWe must use estimates, assumptions and judgments when assets and liabilities are measured and reported at fair value. Assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility. Changes in underlying factors or assumptions in any of the areas underlying our estimates could materially impact our future financial condition and results of operations. During periods of market disruption, it would be difficult to value certain assets if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. There may be certain asset classes that were historically traded in active markets with significant observable data that rapidly become illiquid due to market volatility, a loss in market confidence or other factors. In addition, we have assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are estimated using unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. The valuation of any asset or liability substantially based on unobservable inputs is necessarily less reliable than those based on active trading markets. Further, rapidly changing and unprecedented market conditions in any particular market could materially impact the valuation of assets as reported within our consolidated financial statements. Our ability to hedge exposure is in part dependent on our ability to value the related assets or liabilities.\nThe determination of the amount of loss allowances and asset impairments varies by asset type and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Management updates its evaluations regularly and reflects changes in allowances and impairments in operations as such evaluations are revised. Although we have policies and procedures in place to determine loss allowance and asset impairments, due to the subjective nature of this area, the level of impairments taken and allowances reflected in our financial statements may not accurately reflect the actual level of risk and the amount of future losses.\nThere are risks resulting from the extensive use of models in our business.\nWe rely on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate many financial values. We use models throughout much of our business, relying on them for much of our decision making. Examples of areas we use models include determining the pricing of various products, grading loans and extending credit, measuring interest rate and other market risks, predicting or estimating losses, assessing capital adequacy, and calculating economic and regulatory capital levels. We also use models to estimate the value of financial instruments and balance sheet items. The process of preparing for the implementation of CECL has required the development of significant new and complex models. We will depend on these going forward for our credit loss accounting.\nModels generally evaluate the performance of various factors under anticipated future conditions, relying on historical data to help build the model and in part on assumptions as to the future, often with respect to macro-economic conditions, in order to generate the output. Poorly designed or implemented models, including in the choice of relevant historical data or future-looking assumptions, present the risk that our business decisions based on information incorporating model output will be adversely affected due to the inadequacy of that information. Also, information we provide to the public or to our regulators based on poorly designed or implemented models could be inaccurate or misleading. Some of the decisions that our regulators make, including those related to capital distributions to our shareholders, would likely be affected adversely if they perceive that the quality of the relevant models used is insufficient.\nRisks Related to Our Need for Customers\nOur success depends on our ability to attract and retain customers for our products and services.\nOur performance is subject to risks associated with declines in customer demand for our products and services. As a result of the nature of those products and services, we are particularly at risk for losses of economic confidence or customer trust in us.\nEconomic and market developments may affect consumer and business confidence levels. If customers lose confidence due to concerns regarding the economy, the demand for our products and services could suffer. We may also fail to attract or retain customers if we are unable to develop and market products and services that meet evolving customer needs or demands or if we are unable to deliver them effectively and securely to our customers. This is particularly true to the extent that our competitors are better able to do so.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. - 2019 Form 10-K 25\nIf we fail to attract and retain customers, demand for our loans and other financial products and services could decrease and we could experience adverse changes in payment patterns. We could lose interest income from a decline in credit usage and noninterest income from a decline in product sales, investments and other transactions. Our customers could remove money from checking, savings or other types of deposit accounts with us in favor of other banks or other types of investment products. Deposits are a low cost source of funds for us. Therefore, losing deposits could increase our funding costs and reduce our net interest income.\nOur ability to attract and retain customer deposits is impacted by the levels of interest rates, as customers balance the benefits of bank accounts such as deposit insurance and some of the convenience associated with more traditional banking products against the possibility of higher yields from other investments. In general, if the spread between the rates we offer and those offered by alternatives to bank accounts widens, customers are often willing to forego the benefits of bank accounts for higher returns elsewhere. In such circumstances, we would need either to increase rates to levels that are seen as competitive or lose customers, in either case with a negative impact to net interest income. Loss of customers could also harm noninterest income by decreasing fee-bearing transaction volume. In addition, when rates are higher, customers tend to shift deposits from noninterest-bearing accounts to interest-bearing ones, thereby negatively impacting net interest income.\nOur customers increasingly use third party financial applications that are expected to interface with their PNC accounts. This use leads to the risk that issues with respect to the effective functioning of that interface, regardless of cause, could result in a loss of customers as they seek banking relationships that work better with these other applications.\nNews or other publicity that harms our reputation, or harms the reputation of our industry generally, also could cause a loss of customers or a reduction in the extent to which customers do business with us. This is described further in the Risk Factor headed \u201cWe are at risk for an adverse impact on our business due to damage to our reputation.\u201d\nIn our asset management business, investment performance is an important factor influencing the level of assets that we manage. Poor investment performance could hurt revenue and growth as existing clients might withdraw funds in favor of better performing products. Additionally, the ability to attract funds from existing and new clients might diminish. Overall economic conditions may limit the amount that customers are able or willing to invest as well as the value of the assets they do invest. The failure or negative performance of products of other financial institutions could lead to a loss of confidence in similar products offered by us without regard to the performance of our products. Such a negative contagion could lead to withdrawals, redemptions and liquidity issues in such products and have an adverse impact on our assets under management and asset management revenues and earnings.\nWe are at risk for an adverse impact on our business due to damage to our reputation.\nOur ability to compete effectively, to attract and retain customers and employees, and to grow our business is dependent on maintaining our reputation and having the trust of our customers and employees. Many types of developments, if publicized, can negatively impact a company\u2019s reputation with adverse consequences to its business.\nFinancial services companies are highly vulnerable to reputational damage when they are found to have harmed customers, particularly retail customers, through conduct that is seen as illegal, unfair, deceptive, manipulative or otherwise wrongful. There also may be reputational damage from human error or systems failures viewed as having harmed customers but not involving misconduct. The reputational impact is likely greater to the extent that the bad conduct, error or failure are pervasive, long-standing or affect a significant number of customers, particularly retail consumers. The negative impact of such reputational damage on our business may be disproportionate to the actual harm caused to customers. It may be severe even if we fully remediate any harm suffered by our customers. In addition, we could suffer reputational harm and a loss of customer trust as a result of conduct of others in the industry even where we have not engaged in the conduct. We use third parties to help in many aspects of our business, with the risk that their conduct can affect our reputation regardless of the degree to which we are responsible for it.\nTo an increasing extent, financial services companies, including PNC, are facing criticism from social and environmental activists, with accompanying reputational risk. Activists target companies in our industry for engaging in business with specific customers or with customers in particular industries, where the customers\u2019 activities, even if legal, are perceived as having harmful impacts on matters such as environment, consumer health and safety, or society at large. Activist criticism has come in many forms, including protests at PNC facilities. PNC, together with many other financial services companies, have in recent years been criticized for financing companies engaged in, for example, extraction and distribution of fossil fuels, manufacture of nuclear and other weapons (including personal firearms), private prisons, and border control activities. Many of these issues are divisive without broad agreement as to the appropriate steps a company such as PNC should take and often with strong feelings on both sides. As a result, however we respond to such criticism, we expose ourselves to the risks that current or potential customers decline to do business with us or current or potential employees refuse to work for us. This can be true regardless of whether we are perceived by some as not having done enough to address activist concerns or by others as having inappropriately yielded to activist pressures. Activist pressure can also be a factor in decisions as to which business opportunities and customers we pursue, potentially resulting in foregone profit opportunities.\nThe speed with which information now moves through social media and non-mainstream news sources on the internet means that negative information about PNC can rapidly have a broadly adverse impact on our reputation. This is true whether or not the information is accurate. Once information has gone viral, it can be hard to counter it effectively, either by correcting inaccuracies or\n26 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. - 2019 Form 10-K\ncommunicating remedial steps taken for actual issues. The potential impact of negative information going viral means that material reputational harm can result from a single discrete or isolated incident.\nWe are also subject to the risk of reputational harm resulting from conduct of persons identified as our employees but acting outside of the scope of their employment, including through their activities on personal social media.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment in terms of the products and services we offer and the geographic markets in which we conduct business, as well as the labor markets where we compete for talented employees.\nWe are subject to intense competition both from other financial institutions and from non-bank entities, including financial technology companies (often referred to as FinTech). In many cases, non-bank entities can engage in many activities similar to ours without being subject to the same types of regulation, supervision and restrictions as are applicable to banks. The competition we face is described in Item 1 of this Report under \u201cCompetition.\u201d\nConsolidation in our industry, including among smaller banks combining to form more competitive larger ones and between banks and non-bank entities, could result in PNC facing more intense competition, particularly in impacted regions or with respect to particular products.\nAnother increasingly competitive factor in the financial services industry is the ability to attract and retain talented employees across many of our businesses and support areas. This factor presents greater risk when we are expanding into new markets, developing new product lines, or significantly enhancing staffing in certain areas, particularly technology. This competition leads to increased expenses in affected business areas. Limitations on the manner in which regulated financial institutions can compensate their officers and employees, including those contained in pending rule proposals implementing requirements of Dodd-Frank, may make it more difficult for regulated financial institutions, including PNC, to compete with unregulated companies for talent.\nA failure to adequately address the competitive pressures we face could make it harder for us to attract and retain customers across our businesses. On the other hand, meeting these competitive pressures could require us to incur significant additional expense or to accept risk beyond what we would otherwise view as desirable under the circumstances. In addition, in our interest rate sensitive businesses, competitive pressures to increase rates on deposits or decrease rates on loans could reduce our net interest margin, negatively impacting our net interest income.\nRisks Related to Other Operational Issues\nWe depend on the effectiveness and integrity of employees, and the systems and controls for which they are responsible, to manage operational risks.\nWe are a large company that offers a wide variety of products and services to a broad and diverse group of customers. We rely on our employees to design, manage, and operate our systems and controls to assure that we properly enter into, record and manage processes, transactions and other relationships with customers, suppliers and other parties with whom we do business. In some cases, we rely on employees of third parties to perform these tasks. We also depend on employees and the systems and controls for which they are responsible to assure that we identify and mitigate the risks that are inherent in our relationships and activities. These concerns are increased when we change processes or procedures, introduce new products or services, or implement new technologies, as we may fail to adequately identify or manage operational risks resulting from such changes.\nAs a result of our necessary reliance on employees, whether ours or those of third parties, to perform these tasks and manage resulting risks, we are thus subject to human vulnerabilities. These range from innocent human error to misconduct or malfeasance, potentially leading to operational breakdowns or other failures. Our controls may not be adequate to prevent problems resulting from human involvement in our business, including risks associated with the design, operation and monitoring of automated systems.\nErrors by our employees or others responsible for systems and controls on which we depend and any resulting failures of those systems and controls could result in significant harm to PNC. This could include customer remediation costs, regulatory fines or penalties, litigation or enforcement actions, or limitations on our business activities. We could also suffer damage to our reputation, as described under \u201cWe are at risk for an adverse impact on our business due to damage to our reputation.\u201d\nWe use automation to help reduce some risks of human error. Recently, we have started taking greater advantage of machine learning, artificial intelligence and robotic process automation tools. Nonetheless, we continue to rely on many manual processes to conduct our business and manage our risks. In addition, use of automation tools does not eliminate the need for effective design and monitoring of their operation to make sure they operate as intended. Enhanced use of automation may present its own risks. These tools are dependent on the quality of the data used by the tool to learn and enhance the process for which it is responsible. Not only bad or missing data but also anomalous data can adversely affect the functioning of such tools. It is possible that humans in some cases are better able than highly automated tools to identify that anomalous data is being used or that results are themselves anomalous.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. - 2019 Form 10-K 27\nWe rely on third party vendors, service providers and other counterparties to help support many aspects of our business. When we do so, our direct control of activities related to our business is reduced, which could introduce risk.\nOur use of third parties to support our business needs typically means that we do not directly control the activities we are having them perform. Risks can arise through greater complexity and inadequate performance by the third party, specifically where that performance could affect us or our customers. Many of the kinds of risks presented by activities performed by third parties are described elsewhere in these Risk Factors. For example, we use outside companies to assist us in processing some confidential customer or employee information. In such a case, a cyber attack on such a company may result in access to our customers\u2019 or employees\u2019 information. We are also vulnerable, including to regulatory penalties, where an outside company fails to comply with legal requirements relevant to its work on our behalf. We may in any such circumstance suffer financial losses, legal consequences and injury to our reputation. Even if the other company makes us whole for financial losses, which is not necessarily the case, it is unlikely that it would be able to restore any injury to our reputation. As a result, the use of third parties to assist in our business activities heightens the risks to us inherent in those activities.\nOther Key Risks\nWe are at risk for the impact of adverse results in legal proceedings.\nMany aspects of our business involve substantial risk of legal liability. We have been named or threatened to be named as defendants in various lawsuits arising from our business activities. In addition, we are regularly the subject of governmental investigations and other forms of regulatory inquiry. We also are at risk when we have agreed to indemnify others for losses related to legal proceedings they face, such as in connection with the sale of a business or assets by us. The results of these legal proceedings could lead to significant monetary damages or penalties, restrictions on the way in which we conduct our business, or reputational harm.\nAlthough we establish accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, we do not have accruals for all legal proceedings where we face a risk of loss. In addition, due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings, amounts accrued often do not represent the ultimate loss to us from the legal proceedings in question. Thus, our ultimate future losses may be higher, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies. We discuss further the unpredictability of legal proceedings and describe certain of our pending legal proceedings in Note 19 Legal Proceedings in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.\nAs a result of our substantial minority equity interest in BlackRock, a publicly traded company, its business operations and financial performance can adversely affect PNC and our results.\nOur investment in BlackRock represents a significant investment for PNC and contributes both income (through equity method accounting) and cash inflows (through dividends) to PNC. See Note 22 Segment Reporting in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report. In 2019, BlackRock contributed 15% of our net income. The value of our investment in BlackRock and its contribution to our financial results are vulnerable to poor financial performance or other issues at BlackRock affecting its business. In addition, we rely on BlackRock for its financial results that, as discussed above, are included in our financial statements. BlackRock is responsible for, and has control over, the preparation of its financial statements and its internal controls over financial reporting. PNC may be impacted by factors such as poor performance or other issues, as well as by financial reporting control failures, at BlackRock, with the extent of the impact on us and our financial results depending on the severity of the issue at BlackRock.\nBlackRock is a public company that files separately with the SEC. In its filings with the SEC, BlackRock provides disclosure as to its business, including disclosure regarding its views as to the drivers of its financial performance and the most significant risks it faces. Its SEC filings also include certifications and disclosure regarding internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls.\nWe grow our business in part by acquiring other financial services businesses from time to time. Sometimes these are businesses with technologies or other assets valuable to us even if they do not themselves provide financial services to customers. These acquisitions present a number of risks and uncertainties related both to the acquisition transactions themselves and to the integration of the acquired businesses into PNC after closing.\nAcquisitions of other companies or of financial assets and related deposits and other liabilities present risks and uncertainties to us in addition to those presented by the nature of the business acquired.\nAcquisitions may be substantially more expensive or take longer to complete than anticipated. This risk includes unanticipated costs incurred in connection with the integration of the acquired business. Anticipated benefits (such as cost savings from synergies or strategic gains from being able to offer enhanced product sets) may take longer or require greater resources to achieve. In some cases, it may prove impossible to realize them in their entirety. The success of an acquisition generally is at least partially dependent on our ability to retain and expand upon the acquired company\u2019s customer base. It is also frequently subject to risks related to human capital, including, if being retained, the quality of leadership of the acquired company.\n28 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. - 2019 Form 10-K\nSpecific factors that can affect the ultimate results from acquisitions include, depending on the nature of the business acquired, the following:\n\u2022\nIf the acquisition includes loan portfolios, the extent of credit losses following completion of the acquisition.\n\u2022\nIf a significant aspect of the value of an acquired business is intellectual property, the extent to which the intellectual property may be protected and commercialized by PNC following the acquisition.\n\u2022\nIf the acquisition involves entering into new businesses or geographic or other markets, potential limitations on our ability to take advantage of these opportunities as a result of our inexperience with respect to them.\n\u2022\nThe results of litigation and governmental investigations that may be pending at the time of the acquisition or be filed or commenced thereafter, as a result of an acquisition or otherwise. It is often hard to predict the results of such legal proceedings. It may also be hard to anticipate what legal proceedings may be started following an acquisition.\nOur ability to analyze the risks presented by prospective acquisitions, as well as our ability to prepare in advance of closing for integration, depends, in part, on the information we can gather with respect to the business we are acquiring. We may not have access to all of the information that would be desirable. Our pre-acquisition review of the business also impacts our ability to prepare for and execute on the integration of an acquired business. An acquired company\u2019s financial and business information and data may not be maintained at the level of detail or comprehensiveness to meet all of our post-acquisition needs.\nOur ability to pursue or complete attractive acquisition opportunities could be negatively impacted by regulatory issues, including delays in obtaining required approvals. Our ability to make large acquisitions in the future may be negatively impacted as well by regulatory rules or future regulatory initiatives designed to limit systemic risk and the potential for a financial institution to become \u201ctoo big to fail.\u201d\nOur business and financial performance could be adversely affected, directly or indirectly, by disasters, natural or otherwise, by terrorist activities or by international hostilities.\nNeither the occurrence nor the potential impact of disasters (whether caused naturally or by human conduct), pandemics, terrorist activities and international hostilities can be predicted. However, these occurrences could adversely impact us, for example, by causing significant damage to our facilities or preventing us from conducting our business in the ordinary course. Also, their impact on our borrowers, depositors, other customers, suppliers or other counterparties could result in indirect adverse effects on us. Other indirect adverse consequences from disasters, pandemics, terrorist activities or international hostilities could result from impacts to the financial markets, the economy in general or in any particular region, or key parts of the infrastructure (such as the power grid) on which we and our customers rely. These types of indirect effects, whether specific to our counterparties or more generally applicable, could lead, for example, to an increase in delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults that could result in our experiencing higher levels of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and provisions for credit losses. They could also cause a reduction in demand for lending or other services that we provide. To the extent that climate change increases the frequency or severity of adverse weather conditions, the impact from these types of natural disasters on us or our customers would be worse.\nOur ability to mitigate the adverse consequences of such occurrences is in part dependent on the quality of our resiliency planning. This includes our ability to anticipate the nature of any such event that might occur. The adverse impact of disasters, pandemics, terrorist activities or international hostilities also could be increased to the extent that there is a lack of preparedness on the part of national or regional emergency responders or on the part of other organizations and businesses that we deal with, many of which we depend on but have limited or no control over.", "PERMNO": 60442, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "PNC"}
