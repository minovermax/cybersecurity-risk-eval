{"cik": "866121", "company": "ORBITAL ATK, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-04-28", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe are subject to a number of risks, including those related to being a U.S. Government contractor and those related to domestic and international commercial sales. The material risks we are subject to are discussed below.\nOur business could be adversely impacted by reductions or changes in NASA or U.S. Government military spending.\nWe depend on contracts with the U.S. Government and its prime contractors for a substantial portion of our sales. In addition, a significant portion of such sales come from a small number of contracts. Our CRS contracts with NASA, which are reported within Flight Systems Group and Space Systems Group, comprised 5% of our sales in the year ended December 31, 2016. Our small-caliber ammunition contract with the U.S. Army, which is reported within Defense Systems Group, comprised 6% , 6%, and 12% of our sales in calendar 2016, the 2015 transition period, and fiscal 2015, respectively. The loss or significant reduction of a material U.S. Government program in which we participate could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition or cash flows.\nU.S. Government contracts are dependent on the continuing availability of Congressional appropriations. Congress usually appropriates funds for a given program on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year. As a result, at the outset of a major program, the contract is usually incrementally funded, and additional monies are normally committed to the contract by the procuring agency only as Congress makes appropriations for future fiscal years. In addition, most U.S. Government contracts are subject to modification if funding is changed. Key programs in which we participate must compete with other programs for consideration during the federal budgeting and appropriation process, and support and funding for any U.S. Government program may be influenced by general economic conditions, political considerations and other factors. A decline in U.S. Government support and funding for programs in which we participate could result in contract terminations, delays in contract awards, the failure to exercise contract options, the cancellation of planned procurements and fewer new business opportunities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition or cash flows.\nWe are subject to intense competition for U.S. Government contracts and programs and therefore may not be able to compete successfully.\nWe encounter competition for most contracts and programs, including in particular, U.S. government contracts. Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, marketing, manufacturing, distribution and other resources. Our ability to compete for these contracts depends to a large extent upon:\n\u2022\nthe creativity and effectiveness of our research and development programs,\n\u2022\nour ability to offer better program performance and/or at a lower cost than our competitors,\n\u2022\nthe readiness of our facilities, equipment and personnel to undertake the programs for which we compete, and\n\u2022\nour past performance and demonstrated capabilities.\nIn some instances, the U.S. Government directs a program to a single supplier. In these cases, there may be other suppliers who have the capability to compete for the programs involved, but they can only enter or reenter the market if the U.S. Government chooses to open the particular program to competition and, as such, these types of programs are subject to risk of the U.S. Government providing new awards to other suppliers. Our sole-source contracts accounted for 47% of our U.S. Government sales in the year ended December 31, 2016.\nWe may not be able to react to increases in our costs due to the nature of our U.S. Government contracts.\nOur U.S. Government contracts can be categorized as either \"cost-plus\" or \"fixed-price.\"\nCost-Plus Contracts. Cost-plus contracts are cost-plus-fixed-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee or cost-plus-award-fee contracts. Cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts allow us to recover approved costs plus a fixed fee. Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts and cost-plus-award-fee contracts allow us to recover approved costs plus a fee that can fluctuate based on actual results as compared to contractual targets for factors such as cost, quality, schedule and performance. The award or incentive fees that are typically associated with these programs are subject to uncertainty and may be earned over extended periods. In these cases, the associated financial risks for cost-plus contracts are primarily in lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise.\nFixed-Price Contracts. Fixed-price contracts are firm-fixed-price, fixed-price-incentive or fixed-price-level-of-effort contracts. Under firm-fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform certain work for a fixed price and absorb any cost overruns. Fixed-price-incentive contracts are fixed-price contracts under which the final contract price may be adjusted based on total final costs compared to total target cost, and may be affected by schedule and performance. Fixed-price-level-of-effort contracts\nallow for a fixed price per labor hour, subject to a contract cap. All fixed-price contracts present the inherent risk of unreimbursed cost overruns. If the initial estimates used to calculate the contract price and the cost to perform the work prove to be incorrect, there could be a material adverse effect on operating results, financial condition or cash flows. The Lake City Army Ammunition Plant ammunition contract is a fixed-price contract, and as discussed elsewhere in this report, is expected to result in a net loss over the term of the contract. In addition, some contracts have specific provisions relating to cost, schedule and performance. If we fail to meet the terms specified in those contracts, the cost to perform the work could increase or our price could be reduced, which would adversely affect our financial condition. The U.S. Government also regulates the accounting methods under which costs are allocated to U.S. Government contracts.\nThe following table identifies the amount contributed to our U.S. Government business by contract type in the year ended December 31, 2016:\nWe use estimates in accounting for our programs. Changes in estimates have affected our financial results and could affect them in the future.\nContract accounting requires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenues, including the impact of scope change negotiations, estimating program costs, and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion is complex and subject to many variables. Assumptions are made regarding the length of time to complete the contract because costs also include expected increases in wages and prices for materials. Similarly, many assumptions are made regarding the future impact of such things as the business base, efficiency initiatives, cost reduction efforts, contract changes and claim recovery. Incentives or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating revenue and profit rates, and are recorded when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated performance. Estimates of award and incentive fees are also used in estimating revenue and profit rates based on actual and anticipated awards.\nBecause of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes described above, it is possible that materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. For example, we have concluded that the Company\u2019s costs will exceed expected revenues under its long-term contract with the U.S. Army to manufacture and supply small caliber ammunition at the Lake City Army Ammunition Plant, resulting in a material net loss over the contract\u2019s term. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates may adversely affect future period financial performance. Additional information on our accounting policies for revenue recognition can be found in Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in the section titled \"Critical Accounting Policies\" of this report.\nOur U.S. Government contracts are subject to termination at any time, with or without cause.\nOur direct and indirect contracts with the U.S. Government or its prime contractors may be terminated or suspended at any time, with or without cause, for the convenience of the government or in the event of a default by the contractor. If a cost-plus contract is terminated, the contractor is entitled to reimbursement of its approved costs. If the contractor would have incurred a loss had the entire contract been performed, then no profit is allowed by the U.S. Government.\nIf the termination is for convenience, the contractor is also entitled to receive payment of a total fee proportionate to the percentage of the work completed under the contract. If a fixed-price contract is terminated, the contractor is entitled to receive payment for items delivered to and accepted by the U.S. Government. If the termination is for convenience, the contractor is also entitled to receive fair compensation for work performed plus the costs of settling and paying claims by terminated subcontractors, other settlement expenses and a reasonable profit on the costs incurred or committed. While the contractor is entitled to these claims under either type of contract, there can be no assurance that these amounts will be recovered.\nIf a contract termination is for default:\n\u2022\nthe contractor is paid an amount agreed upon for completed and partially completed products and services accepted by the U.S. Government,\n\u2022\nthe U.S. Government is not liable for the contractor's costs for unaccepted items, and is entitled to repayment of any advance payments and progress payments related to the terminated portions of the contract, and\n\u2022\nthe contractor may be liable for excess costs incurred by the U.S. Government in procuring undelivered items from another source.\nOne of our major programs is as the provider of solid rocket motors for NASA's SLS program. In the event NASA were to cancel the SLS program, we believe that we will be reimbursed for certain amounts previously incurred by us, as well as amounts to be incurred by us, as part of that termination, (e.g., severance, environmental liabilities and termination administration). There can be no assurance, however, that we would be successful in collecting reimbursement of any termination liability costs.\nOur contracts with NASA to deliver cargo to the ISS is a significant part of our business within Flight Systems Group and Space Systems Group. NASA could cancel this contract for any reason, including as a result of reductions in appropriations or our failure to achieve milestones due to technical issues or delays similar to those that occurred when we experienced an Antares launch failure in 2014. A cancellation of our NASA contracts could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur small-caliber ammunition operations for the U.S. military and U.S. allies are conducted at the Lake City Army Ammunition Plant in Independence, Missouri. The Lake City Army Ammunition Plant is the U.S. Army's principal small-caliber ammunition production facility and is the primary supplier of the U.S. military's small-caliber ammunition needs. We took over operation of this facility in 2000 and are responsible for the operation and management. In September 2012, we were awarded new contracts for the continued production of ammunition and continued operation and maintenance of the Lake City Army Ammunition Plant. The production contract has an initial term of seven years plus the possibility of an award term extension of an additional three years if the Company does not provide written notice of rejection to the U.S. Army. We presently believe that it is probable that we will provide written notice of rejection of the additional three-year award term, which would result in materially lower sales for the Company.\nOther risks associated with U.S. Government contracts may expose us to adverse consequences.\nLike all U.S. Government contractors, we are subject to possible losses on contracts due to risks associated with uncertain cost factors related to:\n\u2022\nscarce technological skills and components,\n\u2022\nthe frequent need to bid on programs in advance of design completion, which may result in unforeseen technological difficulties and/or cost overruns,\n\u2022\nthe substantial time and effort required for design and development,\n\u2022\ndesign complexity,\n\u2022\nrapid obsolescence, and\n\u2022\nthe potential need for design improvement.\nSuch factors can increase the costs associated with a program and delay performance, reducing our profitability and adversely impacting our customer relationships.\nWe manufacture and provide commercial aircraft components which could subject us to exposure unique to the commercial aircraft industry.\nAirbus and Boeing have the contractual right to cancel their contracts with us for convenience, which could include the termination of one or more aircraft models or programs for which we supply products. Although Airbus and Boeing would be required to reimburse us in certain situations for expenses, there can be no assurance these payments would adequately cover our expenses or lost profits resulting from the termination. Furthermore, if Airbus or Boeing experiences a decrease in requirements for the products which we supply to it, a major disruptions in its business, such as a strike, work stoppage or slowdown, fails to perform on its contractual obligations under its agreements with us or we cannot meet the expected production rate increases our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nWe are subject to procurement and other related laws and regulations, and non-compliance may expose us to adverse consequences.\nWe are subject to extensive and complex U.S. Government procurement laws and regulations, along with ongoing U.S. Government audits and reviews of contract procurement, performance and administration. As a result, U.S. Government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency, various agency Inspectors General and the U.S. Department of Justice,\nroutinely audit and investigate government contractors. In particular, these agencies often investigate our launch vehicle failures and other material occurrences relating to our products, including an ongoing DoJ/NASA investigation of the 2009 OCO and 2011 Glory failures involving the Taurus XL launch vehicle. These agencies review a contractor's performance under its contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards, including procurement integrity laws and the False Claims Act.\nCharging practices relating to labor, research and development, and other costs that may be charged directly or indirectly to U.S. Government contracts are often scrutinized to determine that such costs are allowable under U.S. Government contracts and furthermore that such costs are reasonable. Any costs determined to be unallowable or unreasonable may not be reimbursed, and such costs already reimbursed may be subject to repayment. If the amount of such costs were significant, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow could be materially adversely affected. We expect to recover a significant portion of our research and development expenses through billings under certain of our U.S. Government contracts in accordance with applicable regulations, but such billings could be reversed or rejected by the U.S. Government. Our inability to recover a significant portion of such expenses could materially adversely affect our operating results, financial condition or cash flows.\nU.S. Government agencies also review the adequacy of, and a contractor's compliance with, its internal control systems and policies, including the contractor's purchasing, property, estimating, earned value, material management and accounting systems. Adverse findings relating to our systems could result in the U.S. Government customer withholding a percentage of payments and also could impact our ability to win new U.S. Government contracts or exercise contract options.\nResponding to government audits, inquiries or investigations may involve significant expense and divert management attention. Also, if an audit or investigation were to uncover improper or illegal activities, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the U.S. Government. In addition, we could suffer serious harm to our reputation if allegations of impropriety were to be made against us.\nChanges in demand for military and commercial ammunition could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe sell military ammunition to the DoD and commercial ammunition to Vista Outdoor under an ammunition supply agreement. Both the commercial and military markets for ammunition are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that can cause demand to fluctuate unpredictably. Decreases in the demand for ammunition in either market could result in excess manufacturing capacity and increased overhead rates as a result, which could have a negative impact on our operating results. Further since our Lake City Ammunition Contract with the Army is in a loss position, increases in demand by the DoD could adversely affect our financial performance including profitability and cash flow. In addition, manufacturing costs for ammunition could rise as a result of a number of factors, including increases in commodity prices and other raw materials and increases in labor costs at our Lake City Army Ammunition Plant, which could also have an adverse effect on our operating results and further increase our net loss under that contract.\nWe manufacture and sell products that create exposure to potential product liability, warranty liability or personal injury claims and litigation.\nOur products may expose us to potential product liability, warranty liability or personal injury claims relating to the use of those products. Our reputation may be adversely affected by such claims, whether or not successful, including potential negative publicity about its products.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with expansion into new and adjacent commercial markets.\nOur long-term business growth strategy includes further expansion into new and adjacent markets. For example, we currently are investing in several new growth initiatives, including new cutting-edge satellite servicing technologies. Such efforts involve a number of risks, including increased capital expenditures, market uncertainties, market acceptance of new technologies, schedule delays, performance risk, extended payment terms, diversion of management attention, additional credit risk associated with new customers, and costs incurred in competing with companies with strong brand names and market positions. An unfavorable event or trend in any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition or cash flows.\nInternational sales are subject to greater risks that sometimes are associated with doing business in foreign countries.\nA portion of our business is derived from international markets. In the year ended December 31, 2016, approximately 17% of our sales were to foreign customers, compared to 23% in the 2015 transition period. We also procure certain key components from non-U.S. vendors. Our international business may pose greater risks than our business in the United States due to changes in economic, legal and political environments, as well as foreign government priorities and budgets.\nInternational transactions frequently involve increased financial and legal risks arising from differing legal systems and customs in other countries. In addition, some international customers require contractors to agree to offset programs that may require in-country purchases or manufacturing or financial support arrangements as a condition to awarding contracts. The contracts may include penalties in the event a company fails to perform in accordance with the offset requirements. Furthermore, international business may create difficulties and risks with respect to the maintenance of an integrated supply chain network. An unfavorable event or trend in any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition or cash flows. Foreign sales subject us to numerous stringent U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including regulations relating to import-export control, exchange controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and certain other anti-corruption laws, and the anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. Export Administration Act. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in material adverse consequences to us.\nOur products are subject to extensive regulation.\nWe are required to comply with extensive regulation of our products, including those rules and regulations administered by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Department of Commerce. These laws include, but are not limited to, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, International Traffic in Arms Regulations, and the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards. Compliance with these laws is costly and time consuming. A violation of these laws could result in significant fines and penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates which could negatively impact profitability.\nSales and purchases in currencies other than the U.S. dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and may adversely affect our results of operations. Currency fluctuations may affect product demand and prices we pay for materials and, as a result, our operating margins may be negatively impacted. Fluctuations in exchange rates may give rise to translation gains or losses when financial statements of our non-U.S. businesses are translated into U.S. dollars. While we monitor our exchange rate exposures and seek to reduce the risk of volatility through hedging activities, such activities bear a financial cost and are not always available or successful in mitigating such volatility.\nWe have restated our prior consolidated financial statements twice recently, which may lead to additional risks and uncertainties, including loss of investor confidence and negative impacts on our stock price.\nAs a result of our recent restatements, we have become subject to a number of additional costs and risks, including unanticipated costs for accounting and legal fees in connection with or related to the restatements and the remediation of our ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. We are also the subject of a non-public investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, securities class action litigation and shareholder demands and potentially other actions as a result of the restatements. In addition, the attention of our management team has been diverted by these efforts. We could be subject to additional shareholder, governmental, or other actions in connection with the restatements and related matters. Any such proceedings will, regardless of the outcome, continue to consume a significant amount of management\u2019s time and attention and may result in additional legal, accounting, insurance and other costs. If we do not prevail in any such proceedings, we could be required to pay substantial damages or settlement costs. In addition, the restatements and related matters could impair our reputation or could cause our counterparties to lose confidence in us. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which could, if not remediated, adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations in a timely and accurate manner, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. In Part II, Item 9A, \"Controls and Procedures\" of this Form 10-K, our management identified several material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.\nAs a result of the material weaknesses, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2016. The assessment was based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. We have developed a remediation plan designed to address the material weaknesses, but our remediation efforts are not complete and are ongoing. If our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weaknesses, or if additional material weaknesses in our internal control are discovered or occur in the future, it may materially adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations in a timely and accurate manner. If we are unable to report our results in a timely and accurate manner, we may not be able to comply with the applicable covenants in our financing arrangements, and may be required to seek additional\nwaivers or repay amounts under these financing arrangements earlier than anticipated, which could adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition.\nAlthough we review and evaluate internal control systems to allow management to report on the sufficiency of our internal controls, we cannot assure you that we will not discover additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. The next time we evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, if we identify one or more new material weaknesses or are unable to timely remediate our existing weaknesses, we may be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nOur failure to prepare and timely file our periodic reports with the SEC limits our access to the public markets to raise debt or equity capital.\nWe did not file this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended July 3, 2016 and October 2, 2016 within the timeframe required by the SEC. Because we have not remained current in our reporting requirements with the SEC, we are limited in our ability to access the public markets to raise debt or equity capital. Our limited ability to access the public markets could prevent us from pursuing transactions or implementing business strategies that we might otherwise believe are beneficial to our business. Even if we maintain compliance with our SEC reporting obligations, we will be ineligible to use shorter and less costly registration forms, such as Form S-3, to register our securities for sale until approximately one year from the date of this filing. Until then, we may use Form S-1 to register a sale of our stock to raise capital or complete acquisitions, but doing so would likely take significantly longer than using a Form S-3, increase transaction costs and adversely impact our ability to raise capital or complete acquisitions of other companies using our common stock in a timely manner.\nThe restatement of our previously issued financial results could result in government enforcement actions and adverse determinations in litigation that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nWe are subject to a non-public investigation by the SEC, securities class action litigation and shareholder demands relating to the restatements. For additional discussion of legal proceedings related to the restatements, see Part I, Item 3 \"Legal Proceedings\" of this Form 10-K. We could also become subject to other investigations or litigation, or one or more government enforcement actions, arising out of the misstatements in our previously issued financial statements. Our management may be required to devote significant time and attention to these matters, and these and any additional matters that arise could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows. While we cannot estimate our potential exposure in these matters at this time, we expect to expend significant amounts defending the litigation and responding to the SEC investigation.\nWe have a substantial amount of debt, and the cost of servicing that debt could adversely affect our business and hinder our ability to make payments on our debt.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had total debt of $1,450 million. In addition, we had $182 million of outstanding but undrawn letters of credit and, taking into account these letters of credit, an additional $818 million of availability under our revolving credit facility. Additional information on our debt can be found in Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in the section titled \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" of this report.\nWe have demands on our cash resources in addition to interest and principal payments on our debt including, among others, operating expenses. These significant demands on our cash resources could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy obligations,\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends and other general corporate purposes,\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the defense and aerospace industries,\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have lower debt service obligations and significantly greater operating and financing flexibility,\n\u2022\nlimit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants applicable to our indebtedness, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds,\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, and\n\u2022\nresult in a default event upon a failure to comply with financial covenants contained in our senior credit facilities which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur ability to pay interest on and repay our long-term debt and to satisfy our other liabilities will depend upon future operating performance and our ability to refinance our debt as it becomes due. Our future operating performance and ability to refinance will be affected by prevailing economic conditions at that time and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nIf we are unable to service our indebtedness and fund operating costs, we will be forced to adopt alternative strategies that may include:\n\u2022\nreducing or delaying expenditures for capital equipment and/or share repurchases,\n\u2022\nseeking additional debt financing or equity capital,\n\u2022\nforegoing attractive acquisition opportunities,\n\u2022\nselling assets, or\n\u2022\nrestructuring or refinancing debt.\nThere can be no assurance that any such strategies could be implemented on satisfactory terms, if at all.\nThe level of returns on pension and postretirement plan assets, changes in interest rates and other factors could affect our earnings and cash flows.\nOur earnings may be impacted by the amount of expense or income recorded for employee benefit plans, primarily pension plans and other postretirement plans. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") require us to calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations. These valuations are based on assumptions made relating to financial market and other economic conditions. Changes in key economic indicators can result in changes in these assumptions. The key year-end assumptions used to estimate pension and postretirement benefit expense or income for the following year are the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the rate of increase in future compensation levels, mortality rates and the health care cost trend rate. We are required to remeasure our plan assets and benefit obligations annually, which may result in a significant change to equity through other comprehensive income (loss). Our pension and other postretirement benefit income or expense can also be affected by legislation or other regulatory actions. Additional information on how our financial statements can be affected by pension plan accounting policies can be found in Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in the section titled \"Critical Accounting Policies\" of this report.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by security threats, including cyber security and other industrial, insider and physical security threats, and other disruptions.\nAs a U.S. defense contractor, we face cyber security threats, threats to the physical security of our facilities and employees, and terrorist acts, as well as the potential for business disruptions associated with information technology failures, natural disasters or public health crises. We also face the risk of economic espionage, which involves the targeting or acquisition of sensitive financial, trade, proprietary or technological information.\nWe routinely experience cyber security threats, threats to our information technology infrastructure and attempts to gain access to sensitive information, as do our customers, suppliers, subcontractors and joint venture partners. We may experience similar security threats at customer sites that we operate and manage.\nPrior cyber-attacks directed at us have not had a material impact on our financial results, and we believe that our threat detection and mitigation processes and procedures are generally adequate. The threats we face vary from attacks common to most industries to more advanced and persistent threats from highly-organized adversaries who target us because we protect national security information. If we are unable to protect sensitive information, our customers or governmental authorities could question the adequacy of our threat mitigation and detection processes and procedures and, as a result, our present and future business could be negatively impacted.\nAlthough we work cooperatively with our customers, suppliers, subcontractors and joint venture partners to minimize the impact of cyber threats, other security threats or business disruptions, we must rely on the safeguards put in place by these entities, which may in turn affect the security of our own information and that of other parties. The entities we work with have\nvarying levels of cyber security expertise and safeguards and their relationships with government contractors, such as us, may increase the likelihood that they are targeted by the same cyber threats we face.\nThe costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means. Occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our internal operations, the services we provide to customers, loss of competitive advantages derived from our research and development efforts or other intellectual property, the obsolescence of our products and services, our financial results, our reputation and our stock price.\nDisruptions in the supply of key raw materials or components and difficulties in the supplier qualification process, as well as increases in prices of raw materials, could adversely impact us.\nKey raw materials used in our operations include aluminum, steel, steel alloys, copper, zinc, lead, graphite fiber, prepreg, hydroxy terminated polybutadiene, epoxy resins and adhesives, ethylene propylene diene monomer rubbers, diethylether, x-ray film, plasticizers and nitrate esters, impregnated ablative materials, various natural and synthetic rubber compounds, polybutadiene, acrylonitrile and ammonium perchlorate. We also purchase chemicals; electronic, electro-mechanical and mechanical components; subassemblies; and subsystems that are integrated with the manufactured parts for final assembly into finished products and systems.\nWe monitor sources of supply to attempt to assure that adequate raw materials and other supplies needed in manufacturing processes are available. As a U.S. Government contractor, we are frequently limited to procuring materials and components from sources of supply approved by the DoD. In addition, as changes occur in business conditions, the DoD budget, and Congressional allocations, suppliers of specialty chemicals and materials sometimes consider dropping low volume items from their product lines, which may require, as it has in the past, qualification of new suppliers for raw materials on key programs. The supply of ammonium perchlorate, a principal raw material used in our operations, is limited to a single source that supplies the entire domestic solid propellant industry. This single source, however, maintains two separate manufacturing lines a reasonable distance apart, which mitigates the likelihood of a fire, explosion or other problem impacting all production. We may also rely on one primary supplier for other production materials. Although other suppliers of the same materials may exist, the addition of a new supplier may require us to qualify the new source for use. The qualification process may impact our profitability or ability to meet contract deliveries.\nWe also rely on sole source suppliers for a number of key components, including the rocket motors and engines we use on our launch vehicles. If we are unable to obtain such components in the future, due to a supplier's financial difficulties or a supplier's failure to perform as expected, we could have difficulty procuring such components in a timely or cost effective manner. A disruption in the procurement of key components could result in substantial cost increases, significant delays in the execution of certain contracts or our inability to complete certain contracts, any of which could result in a materially adverse impact on our financial results.\nFor example, as a result of the failure of Orbital's Antares launch vehicle in October 2014 and prior engine test failures, we ceased using the AJ-26 rocket engine in our Antares product line and transitioned to a sole-sourced replacement engine, the RD-181. The time, expense and effort associated with our recovery plan resulted in additional costs and delays.\nCertain suppliers of materials used in the manufacturing of rocket motors have discontinued the production of some materials. These materials include certain insulation and resin materials for rocket motor cases and aerospace-grade rayon for nozzles. We have qualified new replacement materials for some programs. For other programs, we or our customers have procured sufficient inventory to cover current program requirements and are in the process of qualifying new replacement materials to be qualified in time to meet future production needs. Our profitability may be affected if unforeseen difficulties in developing and qualifying replacement materials occur.\nWe are also impacted by increases in the prices of raw materials used in production on commercial and fixed-price business. We have seen a significant fluctuation in the prices of commodity metals, including copper, lead, steel and zinc. The fluctuating costs of natural gas and electricity also have an impact on the cost of operating our factories.\nProlonged disruptions in the supply of any of our key raw materials or components, difficulty completing qualification of new sources of supply, implementing use of replacement materials, components or new sources of supply, or a continuing increase in the prices of raw materials, energy or components could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition or cash flows.\nFailure of our subcontractors to perform their contractual obligations could materially and adversely impact our prime contract performance and ability to obtain future business.\nWe rely on subcontracts with other companies to perform a portion of the services we provide our customers on many of our contracts. There is a risk that we may have disputes with our subcontractors, including disputes regarding the quality and\ntimeliness of work performed by the subcontractor, customer concerns about the subcontract, our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a subcontract or our hiring of personnel of a subcontractor. A failure by one or more of our subcontractors to satisfactorily provide on a timely basis the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed-upon services may materially and adversely impact our ability to perform our obligations as the prime contractor. Subcontractor performance deficiencies could result in a customer limiting payments or terminating a contract for default. A default termination could expose us to liability and have a material adverse effect on the ability to compete for future contracts and orders.\nFailure to successfully negotiate or renew collective bargaining agreements, or strikes, slow-downs or other labor-related disruptions, could adversely affect our operations and could result in increased costs that impair our financial performance.\nA number of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, which expire on various dates. Strikes, slow-downs or other labor-related disruptions could occur if we are unable to either negotiate or renew these agreements on satisfactory terms, which could adversely impact our operating results. The terms and conditions of new or renegotiated agreements could also increase our costs or otherwise affect our ability to fully implement future operational changes to enhance our efficiency. In certain instances, we may not be able to pass increased costs from new or renegotiated agreements on to our customers due to the fixed-price nature of many of our contracts, including our small-caliber ammunition contract with the U.S. Army that is performed at the Lake City Army Ammunition Plant.\nOur future success and growth will depend significantly on our ability to develop new technologies and products that achieve market acceptance within acceptable margins while maintaining a qualified workforce to meet the needs of our customers.\nVirtually all of the products produced and sold by us are highly engineered and require sophisticated manufacturing and system integration techniques and capabilities. Our commercial and government businesses both operate in global markets that are characterized by rapidly changing technologies, industry standards, market trends and customer demands. The product and program needs of our government and commercial customers change and evolve regularly. Accordingly, our future performance depends on its ability to identify emerging technological trends, develop and manufacture competitive products, enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors, and bring those products to market quickly at cost-effective prices.\nOur ability to develop new products based on technological innovation can affect our competitive position and requires the investment of significant resources. These development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses, and they may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or that meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings. In addition, the markets for our products may not develop or grow as we anticipate. The failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects.\nIn addition, because of the highly specialized nature of our business, we must be able to hire and retain the skilled and appropriately qualified personnel necessary to perform the services required by our customers. Our operating results, financial condition or cash flows may be adversely affected if we are unable to develop new products that meet customers' changing needs or successfully attract and retain qualified personnel.\nThere can be no assurance that our products will be successfully developed or manufactured or that they will perform as intended.\nMost of the products we develop and manufacture are technologically advanced and sometimes include novel systems that must function under highly demanding operating conditions. From time to time, we experience product failures, cost overruns in developing and manufacturing our products, delays in delivery and other operational problems. We have experienced product and service failures, schedule delays and other problems in connection with certain of our launch vehicles, including the Antares launch vehicle, satellites, advanced space systems and other products. We may have similar occurrences in the future.\nSome of our satellite and launch services contracts impose monetary penalties on us for delays and for performance failures, which penalties could be significant. In addition to any costs resulting from product warranties or required remedial action, product failures or significant delays may result in increased costs or loss of revenues due to the postponement or cancellation of subsequently scheduled operations or product deliveries and may have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition or cash flows. Negative publicity from a product failure could damage our reputation and impair our ability to win new contracts.\nDue to the volatile and flammable nature of our products, fires or explosions may disrupt our business.\nMany of our products involve the manufacture and/or handling of a variety of explosive and flammable materials. From time to time, these activities have resulted in incidents which have temporarily shut down or otherwise disrupted some\nmanufacturing processes, causing production delays and resulting in liability for workplace injuries and fatalities. We have safety and loss prevention programs which require detailed pre-construction reviews of process changes and new operations, along with routine safety audits of operations involving explosive materials, to mitigate such incidents, as well as a variety of insurance policies. However, we cannot ensure that we will not experience similar incidents in the future or that any similar incidents will not result in production delays or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition or cash flows.\nWe are subject to environmental laws and regulations that govern both past practices and current compliance which may expose us to adverse consequences.\nOur operations and ownership or use of real property are subject to a number of federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, as well as applicable foreign laws and regulations, including those for discharge of hazardous materials, remediation of contaminated sites and restoration of damage to the environment. At certain sites that we own or operate or formerly owned or operated, there is known or potential contamination that we are required to investigate, remediate or provide resource restoration. We could incur substantial costs, including remediation costs, resource restoration costs, fines and penalties, or third party property damage or personal injury claims, as a result of liabilities associated with past practices or violations of environmental laws or non-compliance with environmental permits.\nWe expect that a portion of our environmental compliance and remediation costs will be recoverable under U.S. Government contracts. Some of the remediation costs that are not recoverable from the U.S. Government that are associated with facilities purchased in a business acquisition may be covered by various indemnification agreements.\nAlthough we have environmental management programs in place to mitigate risks, and environmental laws and regulations have not had a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition or cash flows in the past, it is difficult to predict whether they will have a material impact in the future.\nCapital market volatility could adversely impact our earnings because of our capital structure.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fluctuation in interest rates. If interest rates increase, we may incur increased interest expense on variable interest-rate debt or short-term borrowings, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results and cash flows.\nWe may pursue or complete acquisitions, or other strategic transactions, which represent additional risk and could impact future financial results.\nOur business strategy includes the potential for future acquisitions or other similar strategic transactions. Acquisitions involve a number of risks including negotiating an appropriate price, successfully integrating the acquired company with our operations, and unanticipated liabilities or contingencies related to the acquired company. We cannot ensure that the expected benefits of any future acquisitions or other transactions will be realized. Costs could be incurred on pursuits or proposed acquisitions that have not yet or may not close which could significantly impact our operating results, financial condition or cash flows. Additionally, after the acquisition, unforeseen issues could arise which adversely affect the anticipated returns or which are otherwise not recoverable as an adjustment to the purchase price. Even after careful integration efforts, actual operating results may vary significantly from initial estimates. Furthermore, we may engage in other strategic business transactions, such as joint ventures or mergers. Such transactions could cause unanticipated costs and difficulties, may not achieve intended results, and may require significant time and attention from management which could have an adverse impact on our business, operating results, financial condition or cash flows.\nOur profitability could be impacted by unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional income tax liabilities.\nOur business operates in many locations under government jurisdictions that impose income taxes. Changes in domestic or foreign income tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation, could result in higher or lower income tax rates assessed or changes in the taxability of certain revenues or the deductibility of certain expenses, thereby affecting income tax expense and profitability. In addition, audits by income tax authorities could result in unanticipated increases in income tax expense.\nProposals for broad reform of the existing United States corporate tax system are under evaluation by various legislative and administrative bodies. We cannot predict the overall impact that such proposals may have on our business. In addition, further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise. These contemplated changes could increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes.\nWe are involved in a number of legal proceedings. We cannot predict the outcome of litigation and other contingencies with certainty.\nWe are subject to lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some involving substantial amounts) that arise out of the conduct of our business including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability, prior acquisitions and divestitures, employment, employee benefits plans, intellectual property, import and export matters, and environmental, health and safety matters. As noted in Part I, Item 3, \"Legal Proceedings\" of this Form 10-K, we are also subject to various claims related to the restatements. Resolution of these matters can be prolonged and costly, and our business may be adversely affected by the ultimate outcome of these matters that cannot be predicted with certainty. Moreover, our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary issues, and we may become subject to or be required to pay damage awards or settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nIf the Distribution does not qualify as a tax-free spin-off under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code (the \"Code\"), including as a result of subsequent acquisitions of our stock or Vista Outdoor, then we or our stockholders immediately prior to the Distribution may be required to pay substantial U.S. federal income taxes and we may be obligated to indemnify Vista Outdoor for such taxes imposed on Vista Outdoor.\nThe Distribution and the Merger are intended to qualify as tax-free to us, our stockholders, Vista Outdoor and Orbital for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, there can be no assurance that the IRS or the courts will agree with the conclusion of the parties and their counsel regarding the tax treatment of the Distribution and Merger. If the Distribution or certain related transactions were taxable, our stockholders would recognize income on their receipt of Vista Outdoor stock in the Distribution, and we would be considered to have made a taxable sale of certain of our assets to Vista Outdoor.\nThe Distribution will be taxable to us pursuant to Section 355(e) of the Code if there is a 50% or more change in ownership of either us or Vista Outdoor, directly or indirectly, as part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the Distribution. Because our stockholders collectively owned more than 50% of our common stock following the Merger, the Merger alone will not cause the Distribution to be taxable to us under Section 355(e). However, Section 355(e) could apply if other acquisitions of our stock before or after the Merger, or of Vista Outdoor after the Merger, are considered to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the Distribution. If Section 355(e) were to apply, we would be considered to have made a taxable sale of certain assets to Vista Outdoor and could recognize a substantial taxable gain.\nUnder the tax matters agreement between us and Vista Outdoor (the \"Tax Matters Agreement\"), in certain circumstances, and subject to certain limitations, Vista Outdoor is required to indemnify us against taxes on the Distribution that arise as a result of actions or failures to act by Vista Outdoor, or as a result of Section 355(e) applying due to acquisitions of Vista Outdoor stock after the Distribution. In other cases, however, we might recognize taxable gain on the Distribution without being entitled to an indemnification payment under the Tax Matters Agreement. If such tax is imposed on Vista Outdoor, then we generally will be required to indemnify Vista Outdoor for that tax.", "PERMNO": 76477, "SIC": 3480, "TIC": "OA"}
