{"cik": "1496631", "company": "First NBC Bank Holding Co", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-08-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to risk. The following discussion, as well as management\u2019s discussion and analysis and our financial statements and footnotes, set forth the most significant risks and uncertainties that we believe could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or growth prospects. If any of the following risks occur, our actual results could differ materially from those described in our forward-looking statements described elsewhere in this report. These risks are not the only risks that we may face. Additional risks and uncertainties of which management is not aware, or that management currently deems to be immaterial, may also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or growth prospects.\nRisks Relating to our Business\nAs a business operating in the financial services industry, our business and operations may be adversely affected in numerous and complex ways by weak economic conditions.\nOur businesses and operations, which primarily consist of lending money to customers in the form of loans, borrowing money from customers in the form of deposits and investing in securities, are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the United States. Although the United States economy, as a whole, has improved moderately over the past several years, and the economy of the New Orleans metropolitan area has performed more strongly than the national economy, the business environment in which we operate continues to be impacted by the effects of the most recent recession. Uncertainty about the federal fiscal policymaking process, the medium and long-term fiscal outlook of the federal government, and future tax rates is\na concern for businesses, consumers and investors in the United States. In addition, economic conditions in foreign countries, including global political hostilities and uncertainty over the stability of the euro currency, could affect the stability of global financial markets, which could hinder domestic economic growth. The current economic environment is characterized by interest rates at historically low levels, which impacts our ability to attract deposits and to generate attractive earnings through our investment portfolio. All of these factors are detrimental to our business, and the interplay between these factors can be complex and unpredictable. Our business is also significantly affected by monetary and related policies of the United States government and its agencies. Changes in any of these policies are influenced by macroeconomic conditions and other factors that are beyond our control. Adverse economic conditions and government policy responses to such conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur ability to effectively implement our business strategies depends, in large part, on our executive management team and other senior personnel, and our operating results could be adversely affected by the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel.\nWe are led by an experienced core management team with substantial experience in the markets that we serve and our operating strategy focuses on providing products and services through long-term relationship managers. The future success of our business will depend in large part on the performance of our relationship managers, as well as on our ability to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified senior and middle management, including our relationship managers. However, competition for employees is intense, and the process of locating key personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to execute our business plan may be lengthy. If we are unable to continue to attract experienced and qualified personnel, or if we lose the services of any of our key personnel for any reason, we may not be able to identify and hire qualified persons on terms acceptable to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nAs a public company, we also require significant additional senior personnel in our accounting and finance departments to establish and maintain systems designed to ensure the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements. We determined that, as of December 31, 2015, we had insufficient qualified personnel at both the executive management and staff levels with appropriate knowledge, experience and training on accounting and reporting matters, which contributed to the material weaknesses that resulted in the restatement, as well as the inability to timely file this report. As a part of our remediation efforts with respect to the material weaknesses identified in this report, we have committed to adding competent and experienced resources in our accounting and finance departments and to hiring a Chief Operating Officer. If we are unable to attract the appropriate resources in our accounting and finance departments and a suitable Chief Operating Officer, we may be unable to timely remediate the identified material weaknesses or prevent their recurrence, or we may be subject to additional material weaknesses in the future, which could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur business is concentrated in the New Orleans metropolitan area, and we are more sensitive than our more geographically diversified competitors to adverse changes in the local economy.\nWe conduct substantially all of our operations in Louisiana, and more specifically, within the New Orleans metropolitan area. Substantially all of the real estate loans in our loan portfolio are secured by properties located in Louisiana. We compete against a number of financial institutions that maintain significant operations outside of the New Orleans metropolitan area and outside the State of Louisiana. Accordingly, a regional or local economic downturn, or natural or man-made disaster, that affects Louisiana and New Orleans or existing or prospective property or borrowers in Louisiana and New Orleans may affect us and our profitability more significantly and more adversely than our more geographically diversified competitors.\nWhile the economy in the New Orleans metropolitan area is more diversified than in the 1980\u2019s, the energy sector continues to play an important role. At December 31, 2015, approximately $158.4 million, or 4.5% of our loan portfolio, by dollar amount, was made to borrowers in the energy industry in Louisiana, with an additional $6.7 million in outstanding loan commitments. Of this amount, we had $90.2 million in exposure to exploration and production, with the remainder of the exposure being primarily to maritime service companies. These borrowers can be significantly impacted by volatility in oil and gas prices, as well as material declines in the level of drilling and production activity in Louisiana. We are also subject to risks associated with our indirect exposure to the energy sector, as adverse developments in the energy sector can have significant spillover effects on the local economies in markets that we serve, including commercial and residential real estate values and overall levels of economic activity. We are carefully monitoring the impact of oil and gas prices, and their volatility events, on our loan portfolio and have reflected our current assessment of these events in the determination of our allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2015. However, we cannot assure you that we will not be materially adversely impacted by the direct and indirect effects of current and future conditions in the energy industry.\nThe market in which we operate is susceptible to hurricanes and other natural disasters and adverse weather, as well as man-made disasters, which may adversely affect our business and operations.\nSubstantially all of our business is in the New Orleans metropolitan area, an area that has been and will continue to be susceptible to major hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, tropical storms, and other natural disasters and adverse weather. These natural disasters can disrupt our operations, cause widespread property damage, and severely depress the local economies in which we operate. Man-made disasters, like the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill off the Louisiana coast, can also depress sectors that are critical to the New Orleans economy, such as tourism, energy and fishing, and other economic activity in the area. Any economic decline as a result of a natural disaster, adverse weather, oil spill or other man-made disaster can reduce the demand for loans and our other products and services. In addition, the rates of delinquencies, foreclosures, bankruptcies and losses on loan portfolios may increase substantially, as uninsured property losses or sustained job interruption or loss may materially impair the ability of borrowers to repay their loans. Moreover, the value of real estate or other collateral that secures the loans could be materially and adversely affected by a disaster. A disaster could, therefore, result in decreased revenue and loan losses.\nWe may not be able to adequately manage our credit risk, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nOur business model is focused primarily on lending to customers. The business of lending is inherently risky, and we are subject to the risk that loans that we make may not be fully repaid in a timely manner or at all or that the value of any collateral supporting those loans will be insufficient to cover our outstanding exposure. These risks may be affected by the strength of the borrower\u2019s business sector and local, regional and national market and economic conditions. Our risk management practices, such as monitoring the concentration of our loans within specific industries and our credit approval practices, may not adequately reduce credit risk, and our credit administration personnel, policies and procedures may not adequately adapt to changes in economic or any other conditions affecting customers and the quality of the loan portfolio. We determined that, as of December 31, 2015, we had a material weakness related to the monitoring of certain borrowers' ability to repay loans, and we have taken remedial steps designed to address this matter, including strengthening our lending and credit review policies. Finally, many of our loans are made to small and medium-sized businesses that are less able to withstand competitive, economic and financial pressures than larger borrowers. A failure to effectively measure and limit the credit risk associated with our loan portfolio could expose us to increased losses that could adversely affect our financial results.\nOur allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses inherent in our loan portfolio.\nOur experience in the banking industry indicates that some portion of our loans will not be fully repaid in a timely manner or at all. Accordingly, we maintain an allowance for loan losses that represents management\u2019s best estimate of the loan losses and risks inherent in our loan portfolio. The level of the allowance reflects management\u2019s continuing evaluation of industry concentrations; specific credit risks; loan loss experience; current loan portfolio quality; present economic, political and regulatory conditions; and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses is inherently highly subjective and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks, all of which may undergo material changes. Inaccurate management assumptions, continuing deterioration of economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses. In addition, our regulators, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our loan portfolio and the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses and may require adjustments based on judgments different than those of management. Further, if actual charge-offs in future periods exceed the amounts allocated to the allowance for loan losses, we may need additional provision for loan losses to restore the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses. If we are required to materially increase our level of allowance for loan losses for any reason, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur commercial real estate loan portfolio exposes us to risks that may be greater than the risks related to our other mortgage loans.\nOur loan portfolio includes non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans for individuals and businesses for various purposes, which are secured by commercial properties, as well as real estate construction and development loans. As of December 31, 2015, our non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans totaled $974.4 million, or 28.2%, of our total loan portfolio. These loans typically involve repayment dependent upon income generated, or expected to be generated, by the property securing the loan in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service, which may be adversely affected by changes in the economy or local market conditions. Our investment in commercial real estate projects which utilize federal tax credits is one way that we mitigate the risks in our commercial real estate portfolio. In general, commercial real estate projects typically have lower loan-to-value ratios and better collateral coverage, and the federal tax credits provide an equity injection. These loans expose us to greater credit risk than loans secured by residential real estate because the collateral\nsecuring these loans typically cannot be liquidated as easily as residential real estate because there are fewer potential purchasers of the collateral. Additionally, non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans generally involve relatively large balances to single borrowers or related groups of borrowers. Accordingly, charge-offs on non-owner-occupied commercial real estate loans may be larger on a per loan basis than those incurred with our residential or consumer loan portfolios. Unexpected deterioration in the credit quality of our commercial real estate loan portfolio would require us to increase our provision for loan losses, which would reduce our profitability, and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nA prolonged downturn in the real estate market could result in losses and adversely affect our profitability.\nAs of December 31, 2015, approximately 48.8% of our loan portfolio was composed of commercial and consumer real estate loans. The real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower, and we are exposed to risk based on the fluctuations in real estate collateral values. The market value of real estate can fluctuate significantly in a relatively short period of time as a result of numerous factors, including market conditions in the geographic area in which the real estate is located, natural or man-made disasters, and changes in monetary, fiscal or tax policy, among others. We stress test our commercial and consumer real estate portfolio on an annual basis to determine its susceptibility to such a prolonged downturn in the real estate market. A decline in real estate values could impair the value of our collateral and our ability to sell the collateral upon any foreclosure, which would likely require us to increase our provision for loan losses. In the event of a default with respect to any of these loans, the amounts that we receive upon sale of the collateral may be insufficient to recover the outstanding principal and interest on the loan. If we are required to re-value the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values or to increase our allowance for loan losses, our profitability could be adversely affected.\nOur high concentration of large loans to certain borrowers may increase our credit risk.\nOur growth over the last several years has been partially attributable to our ability to originate and retain large loans. Many of these loans have been made to a small number of borrowers, resulting in a high concentration of large loans to certain borrowers. As of December 31, 2015, our 10 largest borrowing relationships ranged from approximately $51.8 million to $96.0 million (including unfunded commitments) and averaged approximately $76.4 million in total commitments. Along with other risks inherent in these loans, such as the deterioration of the underlying businesses or property securing these loans, this high concentration of borrowers presents a risk to our lending operations. If any one of these borrowers becomes unable to repay its loan obligations as a result of economic or market conditions, or personal circumstances, such as divorce or death, our nonperforming loans and our provision for loan losses could increase significantly.\nWe face significant competition to attract and retain customers, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability.\nWe operate in the highly competitive banking industry and face significant competition for customers from bank and non-bank competitors, particularly regional and nationwide institutions, in originating loans, attracting deposits and providing other financial services. Many of our competitors are larger and have significantly more resources, greater name recognition, and more extensive and established branch networks than we do. Because of their scale, many of these competitors can be more aggressive than we can on loan and deposit pricing. Also, many of our non-bank competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. We expect competition to continue to intensify due to financial institution consolidation; legislative, regulatory and technological changes; and the emergence of alternative banking sources. Increased competition could require us to increase the rates that we pay on deposits or lower the rates that we offer on loans, which could reduce our profitability. Our failure to compete effectively in our market could restrain our growth or cause us to lose market share, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe are subject to losses resulting from fraudulent and negligent acts on the part of loan applicants, correspondents or other third parties.\nWe rely heavily upon information supplied by third parties, including the information contained in credit applications, property appraisals, title information, equipment pricing and valuation and employment and income documentation, in deciding which loans we will originate, as well as the terms of those loans. If any of the information upon which we rely is misrepresented, either fraudulently or inadvertently, and the misrepresentation is not detected prior to asset funding, the value of the asset may be significantly lower than expected, or we may fund a loan that we would not have funded or on terms we would not have extended. Whether a misrepresentation is made by the applicant or another third party, we generally bear the risk of loss associated with the misrepresentation. A loan subject to a material misrepresentation is typically unsellable or subject to repurchase if it is sold prior to detection of the misrepresentation. The sources of the misrepresentations may also be difficult to locate, and we may be unable to recover any of the monetary losses we may suffer as a result of the misrepresentations.\nAs a community bank, our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to the growth of our business.\nWe are a community bank and our reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business. Our growth over the past several years has depended on attracting new customers from competing financial institutions and increasing our market share, primarily through the involvement of our employees in our communities and word-of-mouth advertising, rather than on growth in the market for banking services in New Orleans. As such, we strive to enhance our reputation by recruiting, hiring and retaining employees who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities we serve and delivering superior service to our customers. We cannot predict, however, the extent to which our reputation may be impacted by the restatement or our ability to timely file our periodic reports with SEC. If our reputation is negatively affected by the actions of our employees or otherwise, we may be less successful in attracting new customers and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to raise additional capital in the future on acceptable terms when needed or at all.\nWe may be required or otherwise need to raise additional capital in the future to provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet regulatory capital requirements or our commitments and business needs. In addition, we may elect to raise additional capital to support our business or to finance acquisitions, if any. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, and the terms of any issuance, will depend, among other things, on conditions in the capital markets and general economic conditions at that time, our financial and regulatory condition, our results of operations, our credit ratings, and our ability to maintain our listing on NASDAQ. As of August 18, 2016, the ratings of our debt at both the holding company and bank levels by Kroll Bond Rating Agency were non-investment grade. In addition, our ability to raise debt capital may also be adversely impacted by any factors that may limit our ability to service our debt obligations. We cannot assure you that such capital will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed our business, financial condition and results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected, and our stock price may decline.\nOur growth has been aided by acquisitions of our local competitors, which may not continue.\nOur growth during our initial years of operations was aided by acquisitions of several of our local competitors by larger regional or nationwide institutions. As a result of these acquisitions, whether because of disruptions caused by merger integration problems, a desire to stay with a New Orleans-based institution or otherwise, many customers of the target institutions chose instead to bank with us. However, since 2011, we have been the largest bank holding company based in New Orleans by a significant margin, and acquisitions of our New Orleans-based competitors in the future would be unlikely to result in a comparable number of customers seeking a new, locally-based financial institution. The absence of these growth opportunities within the New Orleans metropolitan area could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may not be able to manage the risks associated with our anticipated growth and expansion through de novo branching, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nWe believe that branch expansion has been meaningful to our growth since inception and our business strategy includes evaluating strategic opportunities to continue to grow organically through the expansion of our branch banking network. De novo branching presents certain risks, including those associated with the significant upfront costs and anticipated initial operating losses of establishing a branch; the ability to attract qualified management to operate the branch; local market reception for branches established outside of the New Orleans metropolitan area; local economic conditions in the market to be served by the branch; the ability to secure attractive locations at a reasonable cost; and the additional strain on management resources and internal systems and controls. If we are unable to manage the risks associated with our continued organic growth through de novo branching, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to overcome the integration and other risks associated with acquisitions, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability.\nAlthough we plan to continue to grow our business organically, we may from time to time consider acquisition opportunities that we believe complement our activities and have the ability to enhance our profitability. Our acquisition activities could be material to our business and involve a number of risks, including those associated with:\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management attention from the operation of our existing business to identify, evaluate and negotiate potential transactions;\n\u2022\nthe use of inaccurate estimates and judgments to evaluate credit, operations, management and market risks with respect to the target institution or assets;\n\u2022\ntransaction pricing as a result of intense competition from other banking organizations;\n\u2022\nthe potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities related to the acquisition;\n\u2022\nthe time and expense required to integrate the acquisition;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of the integration of the acquisition;\n\u2022\nhigher operating expenses relative to operating income from the acquisition;\n\u2022\nadverse short-term effect on our results of operations;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key employees and customers as a result of execution failures; and\n\u2022\nthe risks of impairment to goodwill or other than temporary impairment.\nDepending on the condition of any institution or assets or liabilities that we may acquire, that acquisition may, at least in the near term, adversely affect our capital and earnings and, if not successfully integrated with our organization, may continue to have such effects over a longer period. We may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with pending or potential acquisitions. Our inability to overcome these risks could have an adverse effect on our profitability, return on equity and return on assets, as well as our ability to implement our business strategy and enhance shareholder value.\nIf our goodwill becomes impaired, our results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $14.6 million in goodwill, $9.8 million of which was created as a result of our two acquisitions during 2015. We perform an impairment assessment at least annually on October 1, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not the fair value of our goodwill may not be fully recoverable. Estimates of fair value are complex, require us to apply significant judgment and are inherently subjective because they require the future occurrence of circumstances that cannot be predicted with certainty. If the fair value of our goodwill falls below its carrying value, we may be required to recognize goodwill impairment, which would result in a charge to earnings for that period.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately and timely, in which case our business may be harmed, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, and the price of our common stock may decline.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for evaluating and reporting on that system of internal control. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. In connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, we have identified material weaknesses relating to our internal control over financial reporting which are described in greater detail in Item 9A of this report. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company's annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As a result of the material weaknesses, we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2015. Specifically, we identified material weaknesses relating to ineffective control environment and risk assessment, monitoring of credit to borrowers and investments in short-term receivables, accounting for investment in tax credit entities, identification and evaluation of variable interest entities and consolidation of variable interest entities, accounting for business combinations and review of journal entries. However, giving full consideration to these weaknesses, and the additional analyses and other procedures we performed to ensure that our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, our management concluded that our consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods disclosed in conformity with GAAP. While the material weaknesses described above create a reasonable possibility that an error in financial reporting may go undetected, after extensive review and the performance of additional analysis and other procedures, a restatement of prior years financial results was required.\nAs further described in Item 9A of this report, we are taking specific steps to remediate the material weaknesses that were identified; however, the material weaknesses will not be remediated until the necessary controls have been implemented and we have determined the controls to be operating effectively. We will continue to periodically test and update, as necessary, our\ninternal control systems, including our financial reporting controls. However, our actions may not be sufficient to result in an effective internal control environment.\nIf our remedial actions prove insufficient to prevent the recurrence of the internal control weakness, if we identify other material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future, if we cannot comply with our requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner or attest that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm cannot express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting when required, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately and timely. As a result, investors, counterparties and customers may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports; our liquidity, access to capital markets, and perceptions of our creditworthiness could be adversely affected; and the market price of our common stock could decline. In addition, we could become subject to investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SEC, the Federal Reserve or the FDIC, or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\nIf we are unable to comply with the applicable continued listing requirements or standards of NASDAQ, or if we fail to comply with the compliance plan that we submitted to NASDAQ, NASDAQ may delist our common stock from trading on its exchange.\nOur common stock is currently listed on NASDAQ. In order to maintain that listing, we must satisfy minimum listing requirements and standards, including those related to complying with our SEC reporting obligations, as well as certain corporate governance requirements. As a result of our failure to timely file our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as well as our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016, we received notifications from NASDAQ informing us that we were not in compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5250(c)(1). We submitted a plan to regain compliance with NASDAQ\u2019s listing standards, which plan was accepted by NASDAQ. Under the plan, as amended, we agreed to file this annual report by August 25, 2016 and our remaining delinquent SEC filings by September 26, 2016.\nIf we fail to comply with our compliance plan, we expect to receive written notice from NASDAQ that our shares of common stock will be subject to delisting. In addition, if we comply with our compliance plan, but subsequently fail to satisfy other requirements for continued listing on NASDAQ, our shares of common stock will be subject to delisting.\nIf NASDAQ delists our common stock, we expect that our securities could be quoted on an over-the-counter market. However, we would expect to face significant material adverse consequences from any delisting, including reduced liquidity for our securities, reduced coverage from market analysts, decreased ability to issue additional securities in the future and diminished ability to engage in acquisition activity funded by our securities, any of which would also be expected to adversely impact the market value of our securities.\nRegulatory requirements affecting our loans secured by commercial real estate could limit our ability to leverage our capital and adversely affect our growth and profitability.\nThe federal bank regulatory agencies have indicated their view that banks with high concentrations of loans secured by commercial real estate are subject to increased risk and should hold higher capital than regulatory minimums to maintain an appropriate cushion against loss that is commensurate with the perceived risk. That view has been incorporated, among other things, into the recent revised regulatory capital standards commonly known as Basel III, which increase the risk weighting for \u201chigh volatility commercial real estate loans\u201d from 100% to 150%. Because a significant portion of our loan portfolio is dependent on commercial real estate, the Basel III capital framework, as well as any other policies affecting commercial real estate, could limit our ability to leverage our capital.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our investments in short-term receivables.\nAs a part of our liquidity management strategy, we invest in short-term receivables traded over the Receivables Exchange, a New York Stock Exchange listed electronic exchange for the sale and purchase of accounts receivable of companies whose annual revenues exceed $1 billion, whose common equity is listed on a national securities exchange or whose debt is rated by Standard & Poor\u2019s or Moody\u2019s. As of December 31, 2015, we had $25.6 million in investments in short-term receivables. Under the terms of the exchange contracts, the seller of the receivable is contractually committed to repurchase the receivable back from the purchaser if payment is not made by a specified repurchase date, subject to certain exceptions. As with substantially all of our other investment securities, we are subject to credit risk with respect to our investments in short-term receivables, which could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. We engage in a review of all sellers from which we purchase receivables over the exchange prior to investing in short-term receivables. However, we determined that as of December 31, 2015, we had a material weakness related to the evaluation and ongoing monitoring of the financial\nstability and creditworthiness of companies from which we acquired short-term receivables. As a result of the material weakness, we recognized $69.9 million in impairment with respect to our investment in short-term receivables. We have taken or are taking the steps that we believe are necessary to remediate this material weakness by strengthening lending and credit review policies. Moreover, we do not expect to enter into any material amount of investments in short-term receivables in the future.\nWe maintain a significant investment in tax credits, which we may not be able to fully utilize.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we maintained an investment of $108.6 million in entities for which we receive allocations of tax credits, which we utilize to offset our taxable income. We earned and recognized $61.3 million and $38.4 million in tax credits in 2015 and 2014, respectively, and as of December 31, 2015, we had tax credit carryforwards of approximately $146.2 million. We also expect to receive an additional $43.0 million in tax credits related to Federal New Markets tax credits for which qualified equity investments have already been made and $39.0 million in tax credits related to Federal Low-Income Housing tax credits. Substantially all of these tax credits are related to development projects that are subject to ongoing compliance requirements over certain periods of time to fully realize their value. If these projects are not operated in full compliance with the required terms, the tax credits could be subject to recapture or restructuring.\nIf we are required to take a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets, our earnings and capital position may be adversely impacted.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had net deferred tax assets of $205.3 million. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for the temporary differences between the book value and tax basis of our assets and liabilities. We periodically assess deferred tax assets to determine if they are fully realizable. Certain of our deferred tax assets, including our tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards, are subject to expiration if we are unable to utilize them during their respective terms and we actively monitor and manage our investments in tax credit entities and our tax credit activities with a view to maximizing realization of the benefits. The analysis of our ability to realize deferred tax assets requires us to apply significant judgment and is inherently subjective because it requires the future occurrence of circumstances that cannot be predicted with certainty. If, based on all available information, we determine that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be fully realized, a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset must be established with a corresponding charge against earnings for that period. Because of the amount of our net deferred tax asset, the determination that a valuation allowance should be established could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and regulatory capital condition.\nThe ability to utilize our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards could be limited under certain circumstances.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards of $155.0 million in the aggregate, which generally can be utilized to reduce future taxable income. However, the ability to fully utilize our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards could be limited under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, if we were to undergo a change in ownership of more than 50% of our capital stock over a three-year period as measured under Section 382. The application of these rules is complex and generally focus on ownership changes involving shareholders owning directly or indirectly 5% or more of our common stock. The Section 382 limitations could come into play in the event of the sale of the company, significant new stock issuances or other transactions, including secondary market sales of our common stock. We have no plans to sell the company and do not intend to undertake any stock offering that would have the effect of causing a Section 382 change in ownership. However, we cannot assure you that a change in ownership will not occur, including as a result of factors beyond our control. If we experience an ownership change, the resulting limit on the use of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards could result in a material increase in our tax liability in future years, which could impact the value of your shares or the amount that you might receive upon the sale of the company.\nOur effective federal income tax rate may increase.\nAs a result of our utilization of tax credits, we have recognized federal income taxes at effective tax rates substantially below statutory tax rates in every year since our inception. In some years, we paid no federal income taxes, even though we were profitable. We expect that tax credit-motivated investments will continue to be a material part of our business strategy for the foreseeable future. However, our ability to continue to access tax credits in the future will depend, among other factors, on federal and state tax policies, as well as the level of competition for future tax credits. Any of these tax credit programs could be discontinued at any time by future legislative action. If we are unable for any reason to maintain a level of federal tax credits consistent with our historical allocations, our effective federal income tax rate and taxes paid would be expected to increase.\nWe are subject to interest rate risk, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nOur profitability, like that of most financial institutions, depends to a large extent on our ability to manage the risks associated with changes in interest rates. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general\neconomic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Federal Reserve Board. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, can impact our financial condition and results of operations in a number of ways. Net interest income, the primary driver of our earnings, is significantly affected by changes in interest rates. Net interest income is a measure of our net interest margin - the difference between the yield that we earn on our loans and investment securities and the interest rate that we pay on deposits and other borrowings - and the amount and mix of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Changes in either our net interest margin or the amount or mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, which can result from changes in interest rates, could affect our net interest income and our earnings. Although the yield that we earn on our assets and our funding costs tend to move in the same direction in response to changes in interest rates, one can rise or fall faster than the other, causing our net interest margin to expand or contract. Changes in interest rates can also affect our business in numerous other ways. Increases in interest rates can have a negative impact on our results of operations by reducing loan demand and the ability of borrowers to repay their current obligations. Changes in interest rates can also affect the value of the investment securities that we hold. We measure and seek to actively manage our interest rate risk by estimating the effect of changes in interest rates on our earnings under various scenarios that differ based on assumptions about the direction, magnitude and speed of the changes and the slope of the interest rate yield curve. We hedge some of that interest rate risk with interest rate derivatives. At this time, we have positioned our asset portfolio to benefit in a higher or lower interest rate environment, but this may not remain true in the future. Furthermore, our strategies may not have the intended effect. If we are unable to effectively monitor and manage our interest rate risk, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\nLiquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and meet our obligations as they become due.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. Liquidity risk is the potential that we will be unable to meet our obligations as they come due because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding, and we monitor our liquidity and manage our liquidity risk at the holding company and bank levels. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general. In addition, our access to certain funding sources may be adversely impacted as a result of the \"adequately capitalized\" classification of our banking subsidiary. Market conditions or other events could also negatively affect the level or cost of funding, affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet contractual obligations and fund asset growth and new business transactions at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and without adverse consequences. Any substantial, unexpected or prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet deposit withdrawals and other customer needs, which could have a material adverse effect on business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, because our primary asset at the holding company level is the bank, our liquidity at the holding company level depends primarily on our receipt of dividends from the bank. If the bank is unable to pay dividends to us for any reason, we may be unable to satisfy our holding company level obligations, which include the funding operating expenses, debt service and dividends on our Series D preferred stock.\nBy engaging in derivative transactions, we are exposed to credit and market risk, which could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.\nWe manage interest rate risk by, among other things, utilizing derivative instruments to minimize significant unplanned fluctuations in earnings that are caused by interest rate volatility. Hedging interest rate risk is a complex process, requiring sophisticated models and constant monitoring, and is not a perfect science. As a result of interest rate fluctuations, hedged assets and liabilities will appreciate or depreciate in market value. The effect of this unrealized appreciation or depreciation will generally be offset by income or loss on the derivative instruments that are linked to the hedged assets and liabilities. By engaging in derivative transactions, we are exposed to credit and market risk. If the counterparty fails to perform, credit risk exists to the extent of the fair value gain in the derivative. Market risk exists to the extent that interest rates change in ways that are significantly different from what we expected when we entered into the derivative transaction. The existence of credit and market risk associated with our derivative instruments could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.\nThe fair value of our investment securities can fluctuate due to factors outside of our control.\nFactors beyond our control can significantly influence the fair value of securities in our portfolio and can cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of these securities. These factors include, but are not limited to, rating agency actions in respect of the securities, defaults by the issuer or with respect to the underlying securities, and changes in market interest rates and continued instability in the capital markets. Any of these factors, among others, could cause other-than-temporary impairments and realized and/or unrealized losses in future periods and declines in other comprehensive income, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. The process for determining whether impairment of a security is other-than-temporary usually requires complex, subjective judgments about\nthe future financial performance and liquidity of the issuer and any collateral underlying the security in order to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security.\nOur financial results depend on management\u2019s selection of accounting methods and certain assumptions and estimates.\nThe preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amount of related revenues and expenses. Certain accounting policies are inherently based to a greater extent on estimates, assumptions and judgments of management and, as such, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally estimated. These critical accounting policies include the allowance for loan losses, accounting for income taxes, the determination of fair value for financial instruments, the impairment on tax credit investments and accounting for stock-based compensation. Management\u2019s judgment and the data relied upon by management may be based on assumptions that prove to be inaccurate, particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances. Even if the relevant factual assumptions are accurate, our decisions may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate because of other flaws in the design or use of analytical tools used by management. Any such failures in our processes for producing accounting estimates and managing risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services companies are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, and other relationships. We have exposure to different industries and counterparties, and through transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, and other institutional clients. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services companies, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. These losses or defaults could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe rely heavily on our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party servicers, and any systems failures or interruptions could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nOur business depends on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party servicers. We outsource many of our major systems, such as data processing, loan servicing and deposit processing systems. The failure of any of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If significant, sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability.\nWe may bear costs associated with the proliferation of computer theft and cybercrime.\nWe necessarily collect, use and hold data concerning individuals and businesses with whom we have a banking relationship. Threats to data security, including unauthorized access and cyber attacks, rapidly emerge and change, exposing us to additional costs for protection or remediation and competing time constraints to secure our data in accordance with customer expectations and statutory and regulatory requirements. It is difficult or impossible to defend against every risk being posed by changing technologies as well as criminals intent on committing cyber-crime. Increasing sophistication of cyber-criminals and terrorists make keeping up with new threats difficult and could result in a breach. Patching and other measures to protect existing systems and servers could be inadequate, especially on systems that are being retired. Controls employed by our information technology department and cloud vendors could prove inadequate. We could also experience a breach by intentional or negligent conduct on the part of employees or other internal sources. Our systems and those of our third-party vendors may become vulnerable to damage or disruption due to circumstances beyond our or their control, such as from catastrophic events, power anomalies or outages, natural disasters, network failures, viruses and malware.\nA breach of our security that results in unauthorized access to our data could expose us to a disruption or challenges relating to our daily operations as well as to data loss, litigation, damages, fines and penalties, significant increases in compliance costs, and reputational damage, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with our lending activities.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. There is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties, and that we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value by limiting our ability to use or sell it. Although we have policies and procedures requiring environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on real property, these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Future laws or regulations or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws and regulations may increase our exposure to environmental liability.\nRisks Relating to the Regulation of our Industry\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment, which could restrain our growth and profitability.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation and supervision that govern almost all aspects of our operations. These laws and regulations, and the supervisory framework that oversees the administration of these laws and regulations, are primarily intended to protect consumers, depositors, the Deposit Insurance Fund and the banking system as a whole, and not shareholders and counterparties. These laws and regulations, among other matters, affect our lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy, operations and growth. Compliance with the myriad laws and regulations applicable to our organization can be difficult and costly. In addition, these laws, regulations and policies are subject to continual review by governmental authorities, and changes to these laws, regulations and policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of these laws, regulations and policies, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and often impose additional compliance costs. Further, any new laws, rules and regulations could make compliance more difficult or expensive. All of these laws and regulations, and the supervisory framework applicable to the banking industry, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe are subject to regulatory capital requirements, which may adversely limit our operations and potential growth.\nBeginning January 1, 2015, we became subject to new rules designed to implement the recommendations with respect to regulatory capital standards, commonly known as Basel III, approved by the International Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The new rules establish a new regulatory capital standard based on tier 1 common equity, increase the minimum tier 1 capital risk-based capital ratio, and impose a capital conservation buffer of at least 2.5% of common equity tier 1 capital above the new minimum regulatory capital ratios, when fully phased in during 2019. Failure to meet the minimum capital requirements established by Basel III, or higher regulatory capital thresholds that may be imposed by our regulators, may subject us to supervisory action, which may include restrictions on our activities and operations. In addition, failure to meet the capital conservation buffer will result in certain limitations on dividends, capital repurchases, and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. The rules also change the manner in which a number of our regulatory capital components are calculated, including deferred tax assets, and the risk weights applicable to certain asset categories. The Basel III rules generally require us to maintain greater amounts of regulatory capital than we were required to maintain prior to implementation of such rules and may also limit or restrict how we utilize our capital. The application of the more stringent Basel III regulatory capital requirements, as they become fully phased in over time, could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, require us to raise additional capital, adversely affect our future growth opportunities and result in regulatory restrictions or supervisory actions if we are unable to comply with such requirements.\nOur banking subsidiary is \u201cadequately capitalized\u201d as defined by regulatory standards, which may limit additional, external sources of liquidity for the bank and result in other adverse consequences.\nAs of December 31, 2015, First NBC Bank was classified as \u201cadequately capitalized\u201d for regulatory capital purposes. Until it becomes \u201cwell capitalized\u201d for regulatory capital purposes, it will be required to obtain FDIC approval before renewing or accepting brokered deposits and will be unable to offer interest rates on deposit accounts that are significantly higher than the average rates in the market. Moreover, other external sources of liquidity could be affected by the change in capital status.\nAny of these events could limit the bank\u2019s growth opportunities. Other possible consequences of the \u201cadequately capitalized\u201d classification include the potential for increases in the bank\u2019s borrowing costs, premiums for federal deposit insurance and regulatory assessments, which could have an adverse impact on the bank\u2019s results of operations. Further, we may be required by supervisory action to raise additional capital to bolster the regulatory capital condition of the bank at times or in amounts that we would not otherwise select in the absence of a supervisory action. In addition, if the bank were to fall below\n\u201cadequately capitalized\u201d thresholds, the bank would be subject to additional restrictions on its activities and operations. See \u201cItem 1. Business - Supervision and Regulation - Regulatory Capital Requirements - Prompt corrective action regulations.\u201d The bank is working diligently to return to \"well capitalized\" status, but we cannot assure you if or when that will occur.\nFederal and state regulators periodically examine our business and we may be required to remediate adverse examination findings or become subject to supervisory action as a results of those examinations.\nThe Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the Louisiana Office of Financial Institutions periodically examine our business, including our compliance with laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, a federal or state banking agency were to determine that our financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity or other aspects of any of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or that we were in violation of any law or regulation, it may take a number of different remedial actions as it deems appropriate. These actions include the power to enjoin \u201cunsafe or unsound\u201d practices, to require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital, to restrict our growth, to assess civil monetary penalties against our officers or directors, to remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate our deposit insurance and place us into receivership or conservatorship. Any regulatory action against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nOur FDIC deposit insurance premiums and assessments may increase.\nThe deposits of First NBC Bank are insured by the FDIC up to legal limits and, accordingly, subject it to the payment of FDIC deposit insurance assessments. The bank\u2019s regular assessments are determined by the level of its assessment base and its risk classification, which is based on its regulatory capital levels and the level of supervisory concern that it poses. We expect the bank's deposit insurance premiums to increase as a result of the bank's \"adequately capitalized\" regulatory capital classification as of December 31, 2015. Moreover, the FDIC has the unilateral power to change deposit insurance assessment rates and the manner in which deposit insurance is calculated and also to charge special assessments to FDIC-insured institutions. The FDIC utilized all of these powers during the financial crisis for the purpose of restoring the reserve ratios of the Deposit Insurance Fund. Any future special assessments, increases in assessment rates or premiums, or required prepayments in FDIC insurance premiums could reduce our profitability or limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities.\nWe are subject to numerous laws designed to protect consumers, including the Community Reinvestment Act and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions.\nThe Community Reinvestment Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The Department of Justice and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. A successful regulatory challenge to an institution\u2019s performance under the Community Reinvestment Act or fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity, restrictions on expansion, and restrictions on entering new business lines. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. Such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe face a risk of noncompliance and enforcement action with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nThe Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration, and Internal Revenue Service. We are also subject to increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions, which may include restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including our acquisition plans. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us.\nRisks Relating to an Investment in our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may be subject to substantial fluctuations, which may make it difficult for you to sell your shares at the volume, prices and times desired.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile, which may make it difficult for you to resell your shares at the volume, prices and times desired. There are many factors that may impact the market price and trading volume of our common stock, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results, financial condition or asset quality;\n\u2022\nchanges in economic or business conditions, including changes in the price and volatility of oil and gas prices;\n\u2022\ninitiation or termination of coverage by securities analysts;\n\u2022\npublication of research reports and other public communications about us, our competitors, or the financial services industry generally, or changes in, or failure to meet, securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial and operating performance, or lack of research reports by industry analysts or ceasing of coverage;\n\u2022\noperating and stock price performance of companies that investors deemed comparable to us;\n\u2022\nfuture issuances of our common stock or other securities;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nproposed or adopted changes in laws, regulations or policies affecting us, including the interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve;\n\u2022\nthe ability to comply with our plan to regain compliance with NASDAQ's listing rules as well as our ongoing ability to comply with those rules, including the timely filing of our periodic reports with the SEC;\n\u2022\nthe continued listing of our common stock on NASDAQ;\n\u2022\nthe impact of litigation or governmental investigation arising from the restatement;\n\u2022\nperceptions in the marketplace regarding our competitors and/or us;\n\u2022\nsignificant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving our competitors or us;\n\u2022\nother economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory and technological factors affecting our operations, pricing, products and services; and\n\u2022\nother news, announcements or disclosures (whether by us or others) related to us, our competitors, our core market or the financial services industry.\nThe stock market and, in particular, the market for financial institution stocks, have experienced substantial fluctuations in recent years, which in many cases have been unrelated to the operating performance and prospects of particular companies. In addition, significant fluctuations in the trading volume in our common stock may cause significant price variations to occur. Increased market volatility may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock, which could make it difficult to sell your shares at the volume, prices and times desired.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for purposes of the federal securities laws. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We could be an emerging growth company until December 31, 2018, although we could lose that status sooner if our gross revenues exceed $1.0 billion, if we issue more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt in a three year period, or if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30 before that time, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions, or if we choose to rely on additional exemptions in the future. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nThe trading volume in our common stock is less than that of other larger financial services companies, which could increase the volatility of our stock price.\nAlthough our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, the trading volume in our common stock is less than that of many other larger financial services companies. Given the lower trading volume, significant sales of our common stock, or the expectation of these sales, could cause our stock price to fall. In addition, a majority of our outstanding common stock is held by institutional shareholders, and trading activity involving large positions may increase the volatility of our stock price. As a result, shareholders may not be able to sell their shares at the volume, prices and times desired.\nThe rights of our common shareholders are subordinate to the rights of the holders of our Series D preferred stock and any debt securities that we may issue and may be subordinate to the holders of any other class of preferred stock that we may issue in the future.\nWe have issued 37,935 shares of our Series D preferred stock to the U.S. Treasury in connection with our participation in the Small Business Lending Fund Program. In addition, on February 18, 2015, we issued $60.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our subordinated debt securities. The Series D preferred stock and subordinated debt securities have rights that are senior to our common stock. As a result, we must make payments on the preferred stock and the subordinated debt before any dividends can be paid on our common stock and, in the event of our bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holders of the Series D preferred stock and the subordinated debt must be satisfied in full before any distributions can be made to the holders of our common stock. Our Board of Directors has the authority to issue in the aggregate up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, and to determine the terms of each issue of preferred stock and subordinated debt, without shareholder approval. Accordingly, you should assume that any shares of preferred stock and subordinated debt that we may issue in the future will also be senior to our common stock. Because our decision to issue debt or equity securities or incur other borrowings in the future will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, the amount, timing, nature or success of our future capital raising efforts is uncertain. Thus, common shareholders bear the risk that our future issuances of debt or equity securities or our incurrence of other borrowings will negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe do not currently pay dividends on our common stock.\nHolders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Historically, we have retained all of our earnings to support growth and build capital. Any future declaration and payment of dividends on our common stock would depend upon our earnings and financial condition, liquidity and capital requirements, the general economic and regulatory climate in which we operate, our ability to service any equity or debt obligations senior to our common stock and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. In addition, we are subject to certain restrictions on the payment of cash dividends as a result of banking laws, regulations and policies. Finally, because First NBC Bank is our only material asset, other than cash, our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders would likely depend on our receipt of dividends from the bank, which is also subject to restrictions on dividends as a result of banking laws, regulations and policies.\nOur corporate governance documents, and certain corporate and banking laws applicable to us, could make a takeover more difficult.\nCertain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws, and corporate and federal banking laws, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of our organization or conduct a proxy contest, even if those events were perceived by many of our shareholders as beneficial to their interests. These provisions, and the corporate and banking laws and regulations applicable to us:\n\u2022\nenable our Board of Directors to issue additional shares of authorized, but unissued capital stock;\n\u2022\nenable our Board of Directors to issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock with such designations, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Board;\n\u2022\nenable our Board of Directors to increase the size of the Board and fill the vacancies created by the increase;\n\u2022\nenable our Board of Directors to amend our bylaws without shareholder approval;\n\u2022\nrequire advance notice for director nominations and other shareholder proposals; and\n\u2022\nrequire prior regulatory application and approval of any transaction involving control of our organization.\nThese provisions may discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control, including under circumstances in which our shareholders might otherwise receive a premium over the market price of our shares.\nAn investment in our common stock is not an insured deposit and is subject to risk of loss.\nYour investment in our common stock is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or any other government agency. Your investment is subject to investment risk and you must be capable of affording the loss of your entire investment.", "PERMNO": 13934, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FNBCQ"}
