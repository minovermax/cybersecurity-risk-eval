RISK FACTORS\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various material risks and uncertainties, including those described below, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, and the trading price of our common stock. You should carefully consider the material risks and uncertainties described below in addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including, but not limited to, the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d The material risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks that we do not know of or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow could be materially adversely affected, and the trading price of our common stock could decline significantly.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur revenue is uncertain.\nWe have been dependent on licensing revenue from our Remote Power Patent for a significant portion of our revenue. Our Remote Power Patent expired on March 7, 2020 and licensees are no longer obligated to pay us royalties for any period after the expiration date. Notwithstanding the expiration of our Remote Power Patent, Cisco has agreed to pay us $18,691,890 in licensing royalties for the period beginning in the fourth quarter of 2017 through March 7, 2020 (see Note O[5] to our consolidated financial statements included herein). In addition, we believe that Netgear, another licensee of our Remote Power Patent, is obligated to pay us royalties that were not paid during the same period. We have commenced litigation against Netgear (see Note K[6] to our consolidated financial statements included herein). Without licensing revenue from our Remote Power Patent, our revenue will be dependent upon litigation outcomes involving our Cox Patent Portfolio and Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio, our ability to monetize our M2M/IoT Patent Portfolio or new patents to be acquired in the future. We currently have pending litigation against Google and YouTube involving patents within our Cox Patent Portfolio and litigation against Facebook involving certain patents within our Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio (see \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d at pages 23-25 hereof). Patent litigation is inherently risky and the outcome is uncertain. Accordingly, our future revenue is uncertain.\nWe have been dependent upon our Remote Power Patent for a significant portion of our revenue and the patent expired on March 7, 2020.\nOur Remote Power Patent has generated licensing revenue in excess of $151,000,000 from May 2007 through December 31, 2020. Revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 from license agreements for our Remote Power Patent constituted $4,403,000 (100% of our revenue), $3,037,000 (100% of our revenue) and $15,785,000 (71% of our revenue), respectively. As a result of the expiration of our Remote Power Patent on March 7, 2020, we no longer receive licensing revenue for our Remote Power Patent for any period subsequent to the expiration date. However, Cisco has agreed to pay us $18,691,890 in licensing royalties for the period beginning in the fourth quarter of 2017 through March 7, 2020 (see Note O[5] to our consolidated financial statements included herein). In addition, we believe that Netgear, another licensee of our Remote Power Patent, is obligated to pay us royalties that were not paid during the same period. We have commenced litigation against Netgear (see Note K[6] to our consolidated financial statements included herein). Furthermore, we may receive additional revenue related to our Remote Power Patent if we are successful in our new trial against Hewlett-Packard as a result of our successful appeal of the District Court\u2019s judgment of non-infringement to the Federal Circuit (see Note K[1] to our consolidated financial statements included herein and \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d at pages 23-25 hereof). Except for the above related to our Remote Power Patent, our future revenue will be entirely dependent on our ability to monetize our Mirror Worlds, Cox and M2M/IoT patent portfolios or patents acquired in the future.\nOur success is dependent upon our ability to protect our patents.\nOur success is substantially dependent upon our proprietary technologies and our ability to protect our intellectual property rights. We currently own eighty-four (84) patents that relate to various technologies including our Remote Power Patent, Cox Patent Portfolio, Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio, and our M2M/IoT Patent Portfolio. Our Remote Power Patent is subject to challenge at our new trial with Hewlett-Packard as a result of our successful appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (see \u201cLegal Proceedings at page 23 hereof). In addition, certain patents within our Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio and Cox Patent Portfolio are currently being challenged in patent infringement litigation pending in the courts (see \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d at pages 24-25 of this Annual Report). The uncertainty of the outcome of litigation creates risks that our efforts to protect our intellectual property assets may not be successful. If we are not successful in protecting our patents, such an event will have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash-flow.\nWe may not be able to capitalize in the future on our strategy to acquire high quality patents with significant licensing opportunities or enter into strategic relationships with third parties to license or otherwise monetize their intellectual property.\nBased upon the success we achieved from licensing our Remote Power Patent (twenty-seven (27) license agreements which generated in excess of $151,000,000 of revenue), the revenue we generated from our Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio ($47,150,000) and establishing a patent portfolio currently consisting of eighty-four (84) patents, we believe we have the expertise and sufficient capital to compete in the intellectual property monetization market and to enter strategic relationships with third parties to develop, commercialize, license or otherwise monetize their intellectual property. However, we may not be able to acquire additional intellectual property or, if acquired, we may not achieve material revenue or profit from such intellectual property. Acquisitions of patent assets are competitive, time consuming, complex and costly to consummate. Our strategy is to focus on acquiring high quality patent assets which management believes have the potential for significant licensing opportunities. These high quality patent opportunities are difficult to find and are often very competitive to acquire. In addition, such acquisitions present material risks. Even if we acquire additional patent assets, we may not be able to achieve significant licensing revenue or even generate sufficient revenue related to such patent assets to offset the acquisition costs and the legal fees and expenses which may be incurred to enforce, license or otherwise monetize such patents. In addition, we may not be able to enter into strategic relationships with third parties to license or otherwise monetize their intellectual property and, even if we consummate such strategic relationships, we may not achieve material revenue or profit from such relationships.\nWe may not be successful in our new trial with Hewlett-Packard involving our Remote Power Patent.\nOn September 24, 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit overturned the judgment of non-infringement of the U.S. District Court of the Eastern District of Texas in our litigation with Hewlett-Packard involving our Remote Power Patent. The Federal Circuit also vacated the District Court judgment of validity of our Remote Power Patent. The Federal Circuit remanded the case to the District Court for a new trial against Hewlett-Packard. If we are not successful in our new trial with Hewlett-Packard, it will have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash-flow.\nWe may not be successful in enforcing or defending our Cox Patent Portfolio, generating additional revenue from our Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio or generating revenue from our M2M/IoT Patent Portfolio.\nWe acquired our Cox Patent Portfolio in 2013, which currently consists of thirty-nine (39) patents. We have not yet achieved any revenue from our Cox Patent Portfolio. We are currently enforcing patents within our Cox Patent Portfolio against Google and YouTube, who are challenging these patents (see \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d at page 25 hereof). With respect to our efforts to enforce our Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio against Facebook, on May 7, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York granted defendants motion for summary judgment on non-infringement. On January 23, 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the summary judgment finding of non-infringement of the District Court and remanded the litigation to the Southern District of New York for further proceedings. In addition, our M2M/IoT Patent Portfolio, currently consisting of twenty-nine (29) patents, is not currently being asserted and thus it is not anticipated that this portfolio will generate revenue for at least the next twelve months. We may not have future success in enforcing or defending our Cox Patent Portfolio, Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio or M2M/IoT Patent Portfolio, which would have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.\nCash dividends may not be continued to be paid.\nOn June 9, 2020, our Board of Directors approved the continuation of our dividend policy which consists of semi-annual cash dividends of $0.05 per share ($0.10 per share annually) which are anticipated to be paid in March and September of each year. Our dividend policy undergoes a periodic review by our Board of Directors and is subject to change at any time depending upon our earnings, financial requirements and other factors existing at the time. We may not be in a position to continue to pay dividends in the future.\nOur investment in ILiAD Biotechnologies involves a high degree of risk and we may lose our entire investment.\nWe have invested $6,000,000 in ILiAD Biotechnologies, LLC, a privately held clinical stage biotechnology company, dedicated to the prevention and treatment of human disease caused by Bordetella pertussis with a current focus on its proprietary intranasal vaccine, BPZE1, for the prevention of pertussis (whooping cough). As an early stage biotechnology investment, our investment involves a high degree of risk including the potential loss of our entire investment.\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic could have an adverse impact on our business.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has and continues to impact economic activities and the financial markets around the world. As to the impact on our Company, COVID-19 has and continues to cause some delays in the courts including the scheduling of trial dates, which could adversely affect the timing of outcomes of our litigations. We do not expect the current COVID-19 situation to present other direct material risks to our business. Our cash is held at major financial institutions in money-market funds, certificates of deposit, or in short-term fixed income securities. With only three employees, our employees are able to work remotely. However, the ongoing pandemic may present risks that we do not currently consider material or risks that may evolve quickly that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nLegislation, regulations, court rulings and actions by the USPTO have materially increased the risk and cost of enforcement of patents and may continue to do so in the future.\nLegislation, regulations, court rulings and actions by the USPTO have materially increased the risk and cost of enforcing patents. U.S. patent laws were amended by the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, referred to as the America Invents Act, which became effective on March 16, 2013. The America Invents Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. In general, it attempts to address issues surrounding the enforceability of patents and the increase in patent litigation by, among other things, establishing new procedures for patent litigation and new administrative post-grant review procedures to challenge the patentability of issued patents outside of litigation, including Inter Partes Review (IPR) and Covered Business Method Review (CBM) proceedings which provide third parties a timely, cost effective alternative to district court litigation to challenge the validity of an issued patent. In addition, the America Invents Act changes the way that parties may be joined in patent infringement actions, increasing the likelihood that such actions will need to be brought against individual parties allegedly infringing by their respective individual actions or activities. The America Invents Act and its implementation has increased the uncertainties and costs surrounding the enforcement of patent rights, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in patent law could adversely impact our business.\nPatent laws may continue to change and may alter the protections afforded to owners of patent rights. Such changes may not be advantageous to us and may make it more difficult to obtain adequate patent protection to enforce our patents. Increased focus on the growing number of patent lawsuits, particularly by non-practicing entities (NPEs), may result in further legislative changes which increase the risk and costs of asserting patent litigation.\nOur pending patent infringement litigations are time consuming and costly.\nWe have pending litigation against Hewlett-Packard related to our Remote Power Patent, Google and YouTube involving certain patents within our Cox Patent Portfolio as well as pending litigation against Facebook involving certain patents within our Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio (see \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d at pages 23-25 of this Annual Report).\nWhile we have contingent legal fee arrangements, or a contingency plus a fixed cash amount arrangement, with our patent litigation counsel in each litigation, we are responsible for all or a portion of the expenses which are anticipated to be material. In addition, the time and effort required of our management to effectively pursue these litigations is likely to be significant and it may adversely affect other business opportunities.\nWe face intense competition to acquire intellectual property and enter into strategic relationships.\nWith respect to our ability to acquire additional intellectual property or enter into strategic relationships with third parties to monetize their intellectual property, we face considerable competition from other companies, many of which have significantly greater financial and other resources than we have. The patent licensing and enforcement business has grown significantly over the past years and there has been an increase in the number of companies seeking to acquire intellectual property rights from third parties. Companies including, among others, Acacia Research Corporation (NASDAQ:ACTG), Intellectual Ventures, WI-LAN, a subsidiary of Quarterhill Inc. (NASDAQ:QTRH), VirnetX Holdings Corp. (NYSE MKT:VHC), and RPX Corporation seek to acquire or partner with third parties to license or enforce intellectual property rights. It is expected that others will enter this market as well. Many of these competitors have significantly more financial and human resources than us.\nWe may also compete with strategic corporate buyers, litigation funding firms such as Burford Capital Limited, Validity Finance, LLC, Fortress Investment Group, LLC, Parabellum Capital LLC and Bentham Capital LLC, venture capital firms and hedge funds for intellectual property acquisitions and licensing opportunities. Many of these competitors have greater financial resources and human resources than us.\nOur quarterly and annual operating and financial results and our revenue are difficult to predict and are likely to fluctuate significantly in future periods.\nOur quarterly and annual operating and financial results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from period to period. We had revenue of $4,403,000 and incurred a net loss of $1,709,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. We had revenue of $3,037,000 and incurred a net loss of $1,792,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to revenue of $22,106,000 and net income of $7,706,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our revenue and net income was $16,451,000 and $4,133,000, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $65,088,000 and $23,223,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. Accordingly, our revenue, net income and results of operations may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors that are outside our control including our ability and timing in consummating future license agreements for our intellectual property assets, the timing and extent of payments received by us from licensees, the timing and our ability to achieve successful outcomes from current and future patent litigation, whether we will achieve a return on our investment in ILiAD Biotechnologies and the timing of any such distributions, and the timing and our ability to achieve revenue from future strategic relationships.\nThe patent monetization cycle is long, costly and unpredictable.\nThere is generally a significant time lag between acquiring a patent portfolio and recognizing revenue from those patent assets. During this time lag, significant costs are likely to be incurred which may have a negative impact on our results of operations, cash flow and financial position. Furthermore, the outcome of our efforts to monetize our patents is uncertain and we may not be successful.\nIn the future we could be classified as a Personal Holding Company resulting in a 20% tax on our PHC Income that we do not distribute to our shareholders.\nThe personal holding company (\u201cPHC\u201d) rules under the Internal Revenue Code impose a 20% tax on a PHC\u2019s undistributed personal holding company income (\u201cUPHCI\u201d), which means, in general, taxable income subject to certain adjustments. For a corporation to be classified as a PHC, it must satisfy two tests: (i) that more than 50% in value of its outstanding shares must be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals at any time during the second half of the year (after applying constructive ownership rules to attribute stock owned by entities to their beneficial owners and among certain family members and other related parties) (the \u201cOwnership Test\u201d) and (ii) at least 60% of its adjusted ordinary gross income for a taxable year consists of dividends, interest, royalties, annuities and rents (the \u201cIncome Test\u201d). Beginning in July 2020, based upon available shareholder information and certain assumptions as to the attribution of stock ownership, we may have satisfied the Ownership Test. In addition, we may have satisfied the Income Test. In any event, we did not have UPHCI for 2020 because we did not have taxable income as adjusted for purposes of computing UPHCI for 2020. If we satisfy both the Ownership Test and Income Test and have UPHCI for the year ending December 31, 2021 (or for any subsequent year in which such tests are also satisfied), we would be subject to a 20% tax on the amount of UPHCI that we do not distribute to our stockholders.\nWe are dependent upon our CEO and Chairman.\nOur success is largely dependent upon the personal efforts of Corey M. Horowitz, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors. Our employment agreement with Mr. Horowitz expires on July 14, 2021, which we intend to renew. The loss of the services of Mr. Horowitz would have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects. We do not maintain key-man life insurance on the life of Mr. Horowitz.\nOur markets are subject to rapid technological change and our technologies face potential technology obsolescence.\nThe markets covered by our intellectual property are characterized by rapid technological changes, changing customer requirements, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, and evolving industry standards. The introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards may render our technologies obsolete or less marketable.\nIn addition, other companies may develop competing technologies that offer better or less expensive alternatives to the other technologies covered by our intellectual property. Moreover, technological advances or entirely different approaches developed by other companies or adopted by various standards groups could render our other patents obsolete, less marketable or unenforceable.\nThe burdens of being a public company may adversely affect us including our ability to pursue litigation.\nAs a public company, our management must devote substantial time, attention and financial resources to comply with U.S. securities laws. This may have a material adverse effect on management's ability to effectively and efficiently pursue its business. In addition, our disclosure obligations under U.S. securities laws require us to disclose information publicly that will be available to litigation opponents. We may, from time to time, be required to disclose information that may have a material adverse effect on our litigation strategies. This information may enable our litigation opponents to develop effective litigation strategies that are contrary to our interests.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nInvestors may have limited influence on stockholder decisions because ownership of our common stock is concentrated.\nAs of March 1, 2021, our executive officers and directors beneficially owned 30.9% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders may be able to exercise substantial control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets. This concentration of ownership will limit other stockholders' ability to influence corporate matters and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control over us.\nOur common stock may be delisted from the NYSE American Exchange if we fail to comply with continued listing standards.\nOur common stock is currently traded on the NYSE American Exchange under the symbol \u201cNTIP\u201d. If we fail to meet any of the continued listing standards of the NYSE American exchange, our common stock could be delisted. Such delisting could adversely affect the price and trading (including liquidity) of our common stock.\nProvisions in our corporate charter, by-laws and in Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, discourage a takeover and adversely affect existing stockholders.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes the board of directors to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The preferred stock may be issued in one or more series, the terms of which may be determined at the time of issuance by our board of directors, without further action by stockholders, and may include, among other things, voting rights (including the right to vote as a series on particular matters), preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion and redemption rights, and sinking fund provisions, any of which could adversely affect holders of our common stock. Although there are currently no shares of preferred stock outstanding, future holders of preferred stock may have rights superior to our common stock and such rights could also be used to restrict our ability to merge with, or sell our assets to third parties.\nWe are also subject to the \u201canti takeover\u201d provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which could prevent us from engaging in a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with a 15% or greater stockholder for a period of three years from the date such person acquired that status unless appropriate board or stockholder approvals are obtained.\nIn addition, our By-laws contain advance notice requirements for director nominations and for new business to be brought up at stockholder meetings. Stockholders wishing to submit director nominations or raise matters to a vote of stockholders must provide notice to us within specified date windows and in very specific forms in order to have that matter voted on at a stockholders meeting.\nThe aforementioned provisions could deter unsolicited takeovers or delay or prevent changes in our control or management, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over the then current market price. These provisions may also limit the ability of stockholders to delay, deter or prevent a change of control, or approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests.\nOur stock price may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u2022 the outcome of our new trial and further proceedings with Hewlett-Packard involving our Remote Power Patent;\n\u2022 the outcome of our litigation against Google and YouTube involving certain patents within our Cox Patent Portfolio;\n\u2022 the outcome of our litigation against Facebook involving certain patents within our Mirror Worlds Patent Portfolio;\n\u2022 our ability to further develop, license and monetize our M2M/IoT Patent Portfolio;\n\u2022 our ability to acquire additional intellectual property;\n\u2022 our ability to enter into strategic relationships with third parties to license or otherwise monetize their intellectual property;\n\u2022 our ability to achieve a return on our investment in ILiAD Biotechnologies, LLC;\n\u2022 variations in our quarterly and annual operating results;\n\u2022 our ability to continue to pay cash dividends;\n\u2022 our ability to raise capital if needed;\n\u2022 sales of our common stock;\n\u2022 technology changes;\n\u2022 legislative, regulatory and competitive developments; and\n\u2022 economic and other external factors.\nIn addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also have a material and adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 34936, "SIC": 6794, "TIC": "NTIP"}
