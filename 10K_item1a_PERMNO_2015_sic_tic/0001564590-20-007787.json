{"cik": "940942", "company": "Hub Group, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nBecause we depend on railroads for our operations, our operating results and financial condition are likely to be adversely affected by any increase in rates, reduction or deterioration in rail service or change in the railroads\u2019 reliance on us to market their intermodal transportation services.\nWe depend on the major railroads in the United States for virtually all of the intermodal services we provide. In many markets, rail service is limited to one or a few railroads. Consequently, a reduction in, or elimination of, rail service to a particular market is likely to adversely affect our ability to provide intermodal transportation services to some of our customers. Rate increases would result in higher intermodal transportation costs, reducing the attractiveness of intermodal transportation compared to truck or other transportation modes, which could cause a decrease in demand for our services. Further, our ability to continue to expand our intermodal transportation business is dependent upon the railroads\u2019 ability to increase capacity for intermodal freight and provide consistent and reliable service. Our business could also be adversely affected by a work stoppage at one or more railroads or by adverse weather conditions or other factors that hinder the railroads\u2019 ability to provide reliable transportation services. To date, the railroads have chosen to rely on us and other intermodal competitors to market their intermodal services rather than fully developing their own marketing capabilities. If one or more of the major railroads reduced their dependence on us, the volume of intermodal shipments we arrange would likely decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur ability to expand our business or maintain our profitability may be adversely affected by a shortage of drivers and capacity.\nWe derive significant revenue from our intermodal, truck brokerage, dedicated and logistics services. There is significant competition for qualified drivers in the transportation industry. Additionally, interventions and enforcements under the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (\u201cFMCSA\u201d) Compliance, Safety, Accountability program may shrink the industry\u2019s pool of drivers as those drivers with unfavorable scores may no longer be eligible to drive for us. Driver shortages and reliance on third-party companies for the operation of our intermodal, truck brokerage, dedicated and logistics services could adversely affect our profitability and limit our ability to expand our business or retain customers. Most drayage and certain less than truckload companies operate relatively small fleets and have limited access to capital for fleet expansion. Particularly during periods of economic expansion, it may be difficult for Dedicated, HGT and third-party trucking companies to expand their fleets due to chronic driver shortages. Driver shortages may require us to increase drivers\u2019 compensation that we may be unable to pass on to our customers, let trucks sit idle, utilize lower quality drivers or face difficulty meeting customer demands, all of which could adversely affect our growth and profitability.\nIf we fail to maintain and enhance our information technology systems, or if we fail to successfully implement new technology or enhancements, we may be at a competitive disadvantage and lose customers.\nHub Group continues to see technology as key to driving internal efficiencies as well as providing additional capabilities to customers and carriers. In addition, Hub Group\u2019s systems are critical to our operations and our ability to compete effectively as an intermodal provider, dedicated and drayage carrier, truck broker and logistics provider. We expect our customers to continue to demand more sophisticated technology-driven solutions from their suppliers and we must enhance or replace our information technology systems in response. This may involve significant research and development costs, implementation costs and potential challenges. To keep pace with changing technologies and customer demand, we are making investments in our technology, as well as investing in emerging technology to further drive innovation and efficiency. The back-office investments include implementing new order management, transportation management, contract management and financial management processes and systems. In a transformation of this size and scope we must mitigate risk by engaging external expertise and hiring internal experts. If we fail to successfully implement critical technology, if it does not provide the anticipated benefits or it does not meet market demands, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage and could lose customers, materially adversely impacting our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur information technology systems also depend upon the Internet, third-party service providers, global communications providers, satellite-based communications systems, the electric utilities grid, electric utility providers and telecommunications providers as well as their respective vendors, all of whom have at some point experienced significant system failures and outages in the past. We have minimal control over the operation, quality, or maintenance of these services or whether vendors will improve their services or continue to provide services that are essential to our business. Disruptions due to transitional challenges in upgrading or enhancing our technology systems; failures in the services upon which our information technology platforms rely, including those that may arise from adverse weather conditions or natural calamities, such as floods, hurricanes, earthquakes or tornadoes; illegal acts, including terrorist attacks; human error or systems modernization initiatives; and/or other disruptions, may adversely affect our business, which could increase our costs or result in a loss of customers that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nTechnology and new market entrants may also disrupt the way we and our competitors operate. As technology improves and new companies enter the freight brokerage market, our customers may be able to find alternatives to our services for matching shipments with available freight hauling capacity. We must continue to develop innovative emerging technologies to source, track and provide visibility to capacity while exploiting machine learning and artificial intelligence to further improve customer outcomes.\nOur information technology systems are subject to cyber and other risks some of which are beyond our control, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.\nWe rely heavily on the proper functioning and availability of our information systems for our operations as well as for providing value-added services to our customers. Our information systems, including our accounting, communications and data processing systems, are integral to the efficient operation of our business. It is critical that the data processed by these systems remain confidential, as it often includes competitive customer information, confidential customer credit card and transaction data, employee records and key financial and operational results and statistics. The sophistication of efforts by hackers, foreign governments, cyber-terrorists, and cyber-criminals, acting individually or in coordinated groups, to launch distributed denial of service attacks or other coordinated attacks that may cause service outages, gain inappropriate or block legitimate access to systems or information, or result in other business interruptions has continued to increase in recent years. We utilize third-party service providers who have access to our systems and certain sensitive data, which exposes us to additional security risks, particularly given the complex and evolving laws and regulations regarding privacy and data protection. While we and our third-party service providers have experienced cyber-attacks and attempted breaches of our and their information technology systems and networks or similar events from time to time, no such incidents have been, individually or in the aggregate, material to us. Cyber incidents that impact the security, availability, reliability, speed, accuracy or other proper functioning of our systems, information and measures, including outages, computer viruses, break-ins and similar disruptions, could have a significant impact on our operations.\nAlthough our information systems are protected through physical and software safeguards, as well as redundant systems, network security measures and backup systems, it is difficult to fully protect against the possibility of power loss, telecommunications failures, cyber attacks, and other cyber incidents in every potential circumstance that may arise. A significant cyber incident, including system failure, security breach, disruption by malware or ransomware, or other damage, could interrupt or delay our operations, damage our reputation and brand, cause a loss of customers, expose us to a risk of loss or litigation, result in regulatory scrutiny, investigations, actions, fines or penalties and/or cause us to incur significant time and expense to remedy such an event, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position. Furthermore, any failure to comply with data privacy, security or other laws and regulations could result in claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations. As cyber threats are continually evolving, our controls and procedures may become inadequate and we may be required to devote additional resources to modifying or enhancing our systems in the future. In Addition, while we maintain insurance intended to address costs associated with aspects of cyber incidents, network failures and data privacy-related concerns, our coverage may not sufficiently cover all types of losses or claims that may arise.\nThe inability to successfully implement our new enterprise resource planning system could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe are engaged in a multi-year implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system. The ERP is designed to efficiently maintain our books and records and provide information important to the operation of our business to our management team. The ERP will continue to require significant investment of human and financial resources. In implementing the ERP, we may experience significant delays, increased costs and other difficulties. Any significant disruption or deficiency in the design and implementation of the ERP could adversely affect our ability to process orders, service customers, send invoices and track payments, fulfill contractual obligations, meet financial reporting obligations or otherwise operate our business.\nInsurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our earnings.\nWe are exposed to claims related to cargo loss and damage, property damage, personal injury, workers\u2019 compensation, group health and group dental. We maintain insurance coverage with third-party insurance carriers, but we assume a significant portion of the risk associated with these claims due to high self-insured retention (\u201cSIR\u201d) and deductibles. Our operating results could be adversely affected if any of the following were to occur: (i) the number or the severity of claims increases; (ii) we are required to accrue or pay additional amounts because claims prove to be more severe than our original assessment; or (iii) claims exceed our coverage amounts. If the number or severity of claims increases, our operating results could also be adversely affected if the cost to renew our insurance was increased when our current coverage expires. If these expenses increase, and we are unable to offset the increase with higher freight rates to our customers, our earnings could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, insurance companies generally require us to collateralize our SIR or deductible levels. If these collateralization requirements increase, our borrowing capacity could be adversely affected.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and our business may suffer if we are unable to adequately address potential downward pricing pressures and other competitive factors.\nThe transportation industry is highly competitive. We face competition in all geographic markets and each industry sector in which we operate. Increased competition or our inability to compete successfully may lead to a reduction in our volume, reduced revenues, reduced profit margins, increased pricing pressure, or a loss of market share, any one of which could affect our financial results. Numerous competitive factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability, including the following:\n\u2022\nour competitors may periodically reduce their prices to gain business, especially during times of declining economic growth, which may limit our ability to maintain or increase prices or impede our ability to maintain or grow our market share;\n\u2022\nour inability to obtain expected customer retention levels or sales growth targets;\n\u2022\nwe compete with many other transportation and logistics service providers, some of which have greater capital resources or lower cost structures than we do;\n\u2022\nour inability to compete with new entrants in the transportation and logistics market that may offer similar services at lower cost or have greater technological capabilities;\n\u2022\ncustomers may choose to provide for themselves the services that we now provide;\n\u2022\nmany customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs, and this process may depress rates or result in the loss of some of our business to competitors;\n\u2022\nthe continuing trend toward consolidation in the trucking industry may result in larger carriers with greater financial resources than we have;\n\u2022\nadvances in technology require increased investments to remain competitive, and our customers may not be willing to accept higher prices to cover the cost of these investments; and\n\u2022\nbecause cost of capital is a significant competitive factor, any increase in either the cost of our debt or equity as a result of reductions in our debt rating or stock price volatility could have a significant impact on our competitive position.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from our largest customers and the loss of one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and business.\nOur 10 largest customers accounted for approximately 42% of our total revenue in 2019, 41% in 2018 and 36% in 2017. While our dedicated and logistics businesses may involve long-term contracts, those contracts may contain cancellation clauses, and there is no assurance that our current customers will continue to utilize our services or continue at the same levels. A reduction in or termination of our services by one or more of our largest customers could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and business. While we continue to focus our efforts on diversifying our customer base, we may not be successful in doing so.\nOur customers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 businesses may be negatively affected by various economic and other factors such as recessions, downturns in the economy, global uncertainty and instability, the effects or perceived effects of pandemics, changes in U.S. social, political, and regulatory conditions and/or a disruption of financial markets, which may decrease demand for our services or increase our costs.\nAdverse economic and other conditions, both in the U.S. and internationally, can negatively affect our customers\u2019 business levels, the amount of transportation services they need, their ability to pay for our services and overall freight levels, any of which might impair our asset utilization. For example, the effects (or perceived effects) of pandemics (including matters such as the coronavirus) may affect international trade, supply chains, travel, employee productivity and other economic activities. Additionally, uncertainty and instability in the global economy and any other action that the U.S. government may take to withdraw from or materially modify international trade arrangements, including related to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which was agreed upon on September 30, 2018 and is designed to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (\u201cNAFTA\u201d), may lead to fewer goods being transported and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. The U.S. government has made significant changes in U.S. trade policy and has taken certain other actions that may impact U.S. trade, including imposing tariffs on certain goods imported into the United States. To date, several governments, including the European Union, China, and India, have imposed tariffs on certain goods imported from the United States. Any further changes in U.S. or international trade policy could trigger additional retaliatory actions by affected countries, resulting in \u201ctrade wars\u201d and increased costs for goods transported globally, which may reduce customer demand for these products if the parties having to pay those tariffs increase their prices, or in trading partners limiting their trade with countries that impose anti-trade measures. If these consequences are realized, the volume of global economic activity may be significantly reduced. Such a reduction could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCustomers adversely affected by changes in U.S. trade policies or otherwise encountering adverse economic or other conditions may be unable to obtain additional financing or financing under acceptable terms. These customers represent a greater potential for bad debt losses, which may require us to increase our reserve for bad debt. Economic conditions resulting in bankruptcies of one or more of our large customers could have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity in a particular year or quarter. Further, when adverse economic times arise, customers may select competitors that offer lower rates in an attempt to lower their costs, and we might be forced to lower our rates or lose freight volumes.\nOur suppliers\u2019 business levels also may be negatively affected by adverse economic and other conditions and changes in the political and regulatory environment, as well as the effects (or perceived effects) of pandemics and other public concerns, both in the U.S. and internationally, or financial constraints, any one of which could lead to disruptions in the supply and availability of equipment, parts and services critical to our operations. A significant interruption in our normal supply chain could disrupt our operations, increase our costs and negatively impact our ability to serve our customers.\nWe are also subject to cost increases outside of our control that could materially reduce our profitability if we are unable to increase our rates sufficiently. Such cost increases include, but are not limited to, increases in wage rates, fuel prices, interest rates, taxes, tolls, license and registration fees, insurance, revenue equipment and healthcare for our employees.\nOur obligation to pay our carriers is not contingent upon receipt of payment from our clients and we extend credit to certain clients as part of our business model.\nIn most cases, we take full risk of credit loss for the transportation services we procure from carriers. Our obligation to pay our carriers is not contingent upon receipt of payment from our clients. If any of our key clients fail to pay for our services, our profitability would be negatively impacted.\nBecause our business is concentrated on intermodal services, any decrease in demand for intermodal transportation services compared to other transportation services could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe derived 59% of our revenue from our intermodal services in 2019 and 60% in both 2018 and 2017. As a result, any decrease in demand for intermodal transportation services compared to other transportation services could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nRelatively small increases in our transportation costs that we are unable to pass through to our customers are likely to have a significant effect on our gross margin and operating income.\nTransportation costs represented 86% of our consolidated revenue in 2019, 88% in 2018 and 89% in 2017. Because transportation costs represent such a significant portion of our costs, any increases in the operating costs of railroads, trucking companies or drayage companies can be expected to result in higher freight rates. Transportation costs may increase if we are unable to sign on owner-operators or recruit employee drivers as this may increase driver costs or force us to use more expensive purchased transportation. The inability to pass cost increases to our customers is likely to have a significant effect on our gross margin and operating income.\nOur operations may be affected by external factors such as severe weather and other natural occurrences, including floods, fires, hurricanes and earthquakes at operating locations where we have vehicles, warehouses and other facilities. As a result, our vehicles and facilities may be damaged, our workforce may be unavailable, fuel costs may rise, and significant business interruptions could occur. In addition, the performance of our vehicles could be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions. Insurance to protect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from these natural occurrences is subject to coverage limitations, depending on the nature of the risk insured. This insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our damages or damages to others and this insurance may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates. Even with insurance, if any natural occurrence leads to a catastrophic interruption of service, we may not be able to mitigate a significant interruption in operations.\nOur business depends on the availability of fuel. Fuel availability can be affected by natural or man-made disasters, adverse weather conditions, political events, disruption or failure of technology or information systems, price and supply decisions by oil producing countries and cartels, terrorist activities, armed conflict and world supply and demand imbalance. We do not maintain fuel storage and pumping stations at all of our facilities. Therefore, a disruption in the global fuel supply resulting from factors outside of our control, hence increasing the demand for fuel traditionally used by trucks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nAdditionally, fuel costs can be very volatile. Over recent years, fuel prices have fluctuated greatly due to factors outside our control. Significant increase in fuel prices or fuel taxes that were unable to offset by any fuel surcharges or freight rate increases could have an adverse impact on our business operations. We have a fuel surcharge program in place with many of our customers. These fuel surcharges typically allow us the ability to recover the costs associated with the volatile fuel prices. Our inability to time the fuel surcharges billed to customers with the change in fuel costs could affect our operations. Rapid increases in fuel costs could also have a material adverse effect on our operations or future profitability.\nUncertainty about global economic conditions or a global pandemic such as coronavirus could also increase the volatility of our stock price.\nWe use a significant number of independent contractors, such as owner operators, in our businesses. Legislative, judicial and regulatory authorities may continue to take actions or render decisions that could affect the independent contractor classification, which could have a significant impact on our gross margin and operating income.\nWe do business with a large number of independent contractors, such as HGT owner-operators, consistent with longstanding industry practices. Legislative, judicial, and regulatory (including tax) authorities have taken actions and rendered decisions that could affect the independent contractor classifications. Class action and individual lawsuits have been filed against us and others in our industries, challenging the independent contractor classifications. See Item 3 - Legal Proceedings for further discussion and see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements under \u201cLegal Matters\u201d for a description of material pending litigation and regulatory matters affecting us and certain risks to our business presented by such matters. If independent contractors are determined to be employees, or the Company a joint-employer of warehousemen used for our consolidation business, then we may incur legal liabilities associated with that determination, such as liability for unpaid wages, overtime, employee health insurance and taxes. If we were to change how we treat independent contractors or reclassify independent contractors to employees, then we would likely incur expenses associated with that reclassification and could incur additional ongoing expenses. The costs associated with these matters could have a material adverse effect on results of operations and our financial position.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry, and changes in existing regulations or costs of compliance with, or liability for violation of, existing or future regulations or antiterrorism measures could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe Company and various subsidiaries, including Dedicated and CaseStack, are regulated by the Department of Transportation (\u201cDOT\u201d) as motor carrier freight brokers. The DOT prescribes qualifications for acting in this capacity, including surety bond requirements. The transportation industry is subject to DOT regulations regarding, among other things, driver breaks and \u201crestart\u201d rules that can affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or influencing the demand for, and cost of providing, transportation services. The FMCSA, under the DOT, also manages a compliance and enforcement initiative partnering with state agencies designed to monitor and improve commercial vehicle motor safety. We are audited periodically by the DOT to ensure that we are in compliance with various safety, hours-of-service, and other rules and regulations. If we were found to be out of compliance, the DOT could levy fines and restrict or otherwise impact our operations. To date, compliance with these regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. We may also become subject to new or more restrictive regulations relating to carbon emissions under climate change legislation or limits on vehicle weight and size. Future laws and regulations may be more stringent and require changes in operating practices, influence the demand for transportation services or increase the cost of providing transportation services, any of which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe are not able to accurately predict how new governmental laws and regulations, or changes to existing laws and regulations, will affect the transportation industry generally, or us in particular. We are also unable to predict how the change in administration will affect government regulation of the transportation industry. Although government regulation that affects us and our competitors may simply result in higher costs that can be passed along to customers, that may not be the case.\nOur failure to comply with any existing or future laws, rules or regulations to which we are, or may become subject, whether actual or alleged, could have a material adverse effect on our business and on our ability to access the capital required to operate our business. Among other things, any such failure could expose us to reputational harm, loss of business, fines, penalties or potential litigation liabilities, including costs, settlements and judgments, as well as the loss of operating authority and restrictions on our operations.\nFurthermore, terrorist attacks, along with any government response to those attacks, may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Our fleet, other key infrastructure and information technology systems may be targets or indirect casualties of acts of terror, other harmful acts, or war. Further, because transportation assets continue to be a target of terrorist activities, federal, state and local governmental bodies are proposing and, in some cases, have adopted legislation and regulations relating to security issues that impact the transportation industry, including checkpoints and travel restrictions on large trucks. If additional security measures disrupt or impede the timing of our operations, we may fail to meet the requirements of our customers or incur increased expenses to do so. In addition, complying with these or future regulations could continue to increase our operating costs and reduce operating efficiencies. We maintain insurance coverages addressing these risks; however, such insurance may be inadequate or become unavailable, premiums charged for some or all of the insurance could increase dramatically, or regulations may change. These changes could exacerbate the effects of an act of terrorism on our business, resulting in a significant business interruption, increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues or an adverse impact on results of operation.\nOur growth could be adversely affected if we are not able to make or to successfully integrate acquisition prospects.\nWe believe that the failure to integrate an acquired business or assets could significantly impact financial results. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to execute and integrate acquisitions on commercially acceptable terms. Financial results most likely to be negatively affected include, but are not limited to, revenue, gross margin, salaries and benefits, selling general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, net income and our debt level.\nAlthough we believe we have adequate liquidity and capital resources to fund our operations internally, our inability to access the capital markets on favorable terms, or at all, may adversely affect our ability to engage in strategic transactions. The inability to obtain adequate financing from debt or capital sources could force us to self-fund strategic initiatives or even forgo certain opportunities, which in turn could potentially harm our performance.\nOur failure to implement or market new and existing services to existing and potential customers could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nThe Company continues to expand its service offerings. We may continue to add additional services in the future. In the event we implement new service offerings, we may devote substantial resources to educating our customers on such offerings with no assurance that a sufficient number of customers will use such additional services. If we add new services, we may not identify trends correctly or may not be able to bring new services as quickly, effectively or price-competitively as our competitors. Our failure to implement new services or market any existing or future services to our current customer base and/or new customers could have a material adverse impact on our operations.\nWe depend on third parties for equipment essential to operate our business, and if we fail to secure sufficient equipment, we could lose customers and revenue.\nWe depend on third parties for transportation equipment, such as tractors, containers, chassis, trailers and cross docks necessary for the operation of our business. Our industry has experienced equipment shortages in the past, particularly during the peak shipping season in the fall. A substantial amount of intermodal freight originates at or near the major West Coast ports, which have historically had the most severe equipment shortages. As an asset-light freight transportation management company, if we cannot secure sufficient transportation equipment at a reasonable price from third parties to meet our customers\u2019 needs, our customers may seek to have their transportation needs met by other providers with their own assets. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.\nWe may fail to establish sufficient insurance reserves and adequately estimate for future workers\u2019 compensation and vehicle liabilities.\nWe are partially self-insured for vehicle liability and workers\u2019 compensation claims. Our self-insurance accruals are based on actuarially estimated, undiscounted cost of claims, which includes claims incurred but not reported. While we believe that our estimation processes are well designed and comply with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and other accounting and finance best practices, any projection of losses concerning workers\u2019 compensation and vehicle insurance is subject to a considerable degree of variability. The causes of this variability include litigation trends, claim settlement patterns and fluctuations in the frequency or severity of accidents. If actual losses incurred are greater than those anticipated, our self-insurance reserves may be insufficient and additional costs could be recorded in our consolidated financial statements. If we suffer a substantial loss in excess of our self-insured limits, the loss and attendant expenses may be covered by traditional insurance and excess insurance the Company has in place, but if not covered or above such coverages, losses could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are partially self-insured for certain losses related to employee medical coverage. Our self-insurance reserves may not be adequate to cover our medical claim liabilities.\nWe are partially self-insured for certain losses related to employee medical coverage, excluding employees covered by health maintenance organizations. We generally have an individual stop loss deductible per enrollee unless specific exposures are separately insured. We accrue a contingent liability based upon examination of historical trends, historical actuarial analysis, our claims experience, total plan enrollment (including employee contributions), population demographics, and other various estimates. Self-insurance reserves, net income, and cash flows could be materially affected if future claims differ significantly from our historical trends and assumptions.\nThe ability to hire or retain management and other key personnel is critical to our continued success, and the loss of or inability to hire such personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the transportation services industry. Many individuals in the industry are required to sign non-competition agreements, severely limiting our ability to hire qualified personnel to compete in the market-place. As all key personnel devote their full time to our business, the loss of any member of our management team, or other key persons, or the inability to hire key persons, could have an adverse effect on us. We do not have written employment agreements with any of our executive officers and do not maintain key man insurance on any of our executive officers, although we do have non-competition agreements with them. If we lose key members of our senior management team or are unable to effect smooth transitions from one executive to another as part of our succession plan, we may not be able to effectively manage our current operations or meet ongoing and future business challenges, and this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business could be adversely affected by strikes or work stoppages by draymen, truckers, warehousemen, port workers and railroad workers, or the decision of our employees to unionize.\nThere may be labor unrest, including strikes and work stoppages, among workers at various transportation providers and in industries affecting the transportation industry, such as port workers. We could lose business due to any significant work stoppage or slowdown and, if labor unrest results in increased rates for transportation providers such as draymen, we may not be able to pass these cost increases on to our customers. Strikes among longshoreman and clerical workers at ports in the past few years have slowed down the ports for a time, creating a major impact on the transportation industry. Work stoppages occurring among owner-operators in a specific market have increased our operating costs periodically in the past. In the past several years, there have been strikes involving railroad workers. Future strikes by railroad workers in the United States, Canada or anywhere else that our customers\u2019 freight travels by railroad would impact our operations. Any significant work stoppage, slowdown or other disruption involving port workers, railroad workers, truckers or draymen could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nCurrently, none of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. If in the future our employees decide to unionize, this would increase our operating costs and force us to alter the way we operate causing an adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur business may be affected by uncertainty or changes in U.S. or global social, political or regulatory conditions.\nWe arrange for the movement of freight, much of which originates from China, into and out of every major city in the U.S., Mexico and Canada, and we import 53-foot intermodal containers manufactured in China. Adverse developments in laws, policies or practices in the U.S. and internationally can negatively impact our business and the business of our customers. Negative domestic and international global trade conditions as a result of social, political or regulatory changes or perceptions (such as those that might be associated with pandemics) could materially affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations. We provide services both domestically and to a lesser extent outside of the U.S., which subjects our business to various additional risks, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in tariffs, trade restrictions, trade agreements and taxes;\n\u2022\nvarying tax regimes, including consequences from changes in applicable tax laws;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing or overseeing foreign operations and agents;\n\u2022\ndifferent liability standards;\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of fuel;\n\u2022\nuncertainty and changes to political and regulatory regimes as a result of changing social, political, regulatory and economic environments in the U.S. and internationally; and\n\u2022\ngeopolitical conditions, such as national and international conflict, including terrorist acts and the effects (or perceived effects of pandemics (such as the coronavirus).\nIf we do not correctly anticipate changes in social, political or regulatory conditions or their impact on the transportation industry, we may not alter our business practices in time to avoid adverse effects. Additionally, the occurrence or consequences of any of these factors may restrict our ability to operate in the affected region and/or decrease the profitability of our operations in that region.\nOur suppliers may also be affected by changes in the political and regulatory environment, both in the U.S. and internationally. Negative impacts on our suppliers could result in disruptions in the supply and availability of equipment or services needed for our business that could in turn affect our ability to operate and serve our customers as planned. Additionally, changes to current U.S. international trade agreements, such as NAFTA and other trade agreements, may lead to fewer goods transported and we may need to restructure certain terms of business with suppliers or customers. On January 29, 2020, following Congressional approval, President Trump signed an agreement with Mexico on the United States-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement (\u201cUSMCA\u201d), The agreement remains to be ratified by Canada. The full impact of this agreement on us, our customers and on economic conditions is currently unknown.\nOur operations may be subject to various environmental laws and regulations, the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local governmental laws and regulations that govern, among other things, the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the environment, the presence of hazardous materials at our properties or in our vehicles, fuel storage tanks, the transportation of certain materials and the discharge or retention of storm water. Under certain environmental laws, we could also be held responsible for any costs relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at third-party waste disposal sites, as well as costs associated with the clean-up of accidents involving our vehicles. Environmental laws have become and may continue to be increasingly more stringent over time, and there can be no assurance that our costs of complying with current or future environmental laws or liabilities arising under such laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business, operations or financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we arrange for the movement of hazardous materials at the request of our customers. As a result, we may be subject to various environmental laws and regulations relating to the handling of hazardous materials. If we are involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous materials, or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe Company is also subject to certain Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) and California Air Resources Board (\u201cCARB\u201d) regulations. We may become subject to enforcement actions, new or more restrictive regulations, or differing interpretations of existing regulations, which may increase the cost of providing transportation services or adversely affect our results of operations. In addition to EPA and state agency regulations on exhaust emissions with which we must comply, there is an increased legislative and regulatory focus on climate change, greenhouse gas emissions and the impact of global warming. State and local governments are\nincreasingly considering greenhouse gas emissions regulation. This possibility of increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions potentially exposes us to significant new taxes, fees and other costs. We are also subject to increasing sensitivity to sustainability issues. This increased focus on sustainability may result in new regulations and/or customer requirements that could adversely impact our business. Any future limitations on the emission of greenhouse gases, other environmental legislation or customer sustainability requirements could increase our future capital expenditures and have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe are subject to the risks of litigation and governmental inquiries, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe nature of our business exposes us to a variety of litigation risks related to a number of issues, including without limitation, accidents involving our trucks and employees, alleged violations of federal and state labor and employment laws, securities laws, environmental liability and other matters. Accordingly, we are, and in the future may be, subject to legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of our business and may include class-action allegations. We are also subject to potential governmental proceedings, inquiries, and claims. The parties in such actions may seek amounts from us that may not be covered in whole or in part by insurance. These proceedings may be time-consuming, expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. The defense of such lawsuits could result in significant expense and the diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention from the operation of our business. In recent years, several insurance companies have stopped offering coverage to trucking companies as a result of increases in the severity of automobile liability claims and higher costs of settlements and verdicts. This trend could adversely affect our ability to obtain suitable insurance coverage or could significantly increase our cost for obtaining such coverage, which would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. Costs we incur to defend or to satisfy a judgment or settlement of these claims may not be covered by insurance or could exceed the amount of that coverage or increase our insurance costs and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nChanges in immigration laws could increase the costs of doing business or otherwise disrupt our operations.\nWe have hired individuals, including Information Technology (\u201cIT\u201d) employees, from outside the United States. We have employee drivers and owner-operator drivers who are immigrants to the U.S. We engage third party consultants, including for various IT projects, who may utilize personnel from outside the United States. If immigration laws are changed or if new more restrictive government regulations are enacted or increased, our access to qualified and skilled personnel may be limited, the costs of doing business may increase and our operations may be disrupted.\nOur inability to defend our intellectual property could damage our reputation and incur costs that have a negative impact on our operations or financial condition.\nThe Company has registered various trademarks and designs in the United States, Mexico and Canada. These marks play a major role in our business as they strengthen our brand recognition while helping accomplish our marketing strategy. Some of our intellectual property rights related to trademarks, trade secrets, domain names, copyrights, or other intellectual property could be challenged or invalidated or misappropriated or infringed upon, by third parties. Our continued efforts to obtain, enforce, protect and defend our intellectual property against a third-party infringement claim may be ineffective and could result in substantial costs which could adversely impact our corporate reputation, business, results of operations, and financial conditions.\nDamage to our reputation through unfavorable publicity or the actions of our employees could adversely affect our financial condition.\nOur success depends on our ability to consistently deliver operational excellence and strong customer service. Our inability to deliver our services and solutions as promised on a consistent basis, or our customers having a negative experience or otherwise becoming dissatisfied, can negatively impact our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand and reputation, which could, in turn, adversely affect revenue and earnings growth. Adverse publicity (whether or not justified) relating to activities by our employees, contractors, agents or others with whom we do business, such as customer service mishaps or noncompliance with laws, could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand. With the increase in the use of social media outlets such as Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and Twitter, adverse publicity can be disseminated quickly and broadly, making it increasingly difficult for us to effectively respond. This unfavorable publicity could also require us to allocate significant resources to rebuild our reputation.\nThe market value of our common stock may fluctuate and could be substantially affected by various factors.\nWe expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among others:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in earnings, financial or operating performance or liquidity\u037e\n\u2022\nchanges in analysts\u2019 recommendations or projections\u037e\n\u2022\nfailure to meet analysts\u2019 and our Company's projections\u037e\n\u2022\ngeneral political, social, economic and capital market conditions\u037e\n\u2022\nannouncements of developments related to our business\u037e\n\u2022\noperating and stock performance of other companies deemed to be peers\u037e\n\u2022\nactions by government regulators\u037e\n\u2022\nnews reports of trends, concerns and other issues related to us or our industry, including changes in regulations; and\n\u2022\ngeopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism, military conflicts, and the effects (or perceived effects) of pandemics (such as the coronavirus).\nOur common stock price may fluctuate significantly in the future, and these fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance. General market price declines or market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of our common stock, and the current market price of our common stock may not be indicative of future market prices.", "PERMNO": 83272, "SIC": 4731, "TIC": "HUBG"}
