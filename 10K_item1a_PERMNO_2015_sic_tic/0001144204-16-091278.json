{"cik": "1019272", "company": "EMPIRE RESOURCES INC /NEW/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe are highly dependent on a few suppliers.\nOur two largest suppliers in 2015 were PT. Alumindo Light Metal Industry and Hulamin Ltd., from whom we purchased approximately 45% of our products. Accordingly, the termination or limitation by one or more of our largest suppliers of their relationships with us could limit our ability to fulfill customer orders or cause us to purchase products at a loss, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, our loss of any one of our other suppliers (or material default by any supplier in its obligations to us) for any reason, including but not limited to bankruptcy, financial difficulties, expropriation, social unrest, destruction, sabotage, strikes, natural disasters, acquisition by a person or entity unwilling to provide products to us, or for any other reason, could limit our ability to fulfill customer orders or cause us to purchase products at a loss, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAn interruption in the sources of our metal supply could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe rely on our suppliers to fulfill contractual obligations. The failure of any one of our suppliers to fulfill its obligations to us may expose us to serious losses by requiring us to purchase material at a loss in the open market and/or absorb losses for hedges applied to the defaulting supplier\u2019s transaction. Our primary suppliers could curtail or discontinue their delivery of metals to us in the quantities we need with little or no notice. If our suppliers experience production problems, lack of capacity or transportation disruptions, we may be unable to obtain sufficient amounts of metal on a timely basis, or we may not be able to obtain metal from alternate sources at competitive prices to meet our delivery schedules.\nIn addition, in recent years, the metal producing supply base has experienced significant consolidation, with a few domestic producers accounting for a majority of the domestic metal market. The number of available suppliers could be reduced in the future by factors such as further industry consolidation or bankruptcies affecting metal suppliers. Although we have successfully replaced suppliers lost as a result of industry consolidations in the past, there can be no assurance that we will be able to replace the volume of production or the type of products supplied by any of our current suppliers if they were acquired or their operations terminated or were interrupted.\nThe occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are highly dependent on a few significant customers.\nOur sales are highly concentrated among a few customers. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, 37% and 34%, respectively, of our revenues were derived from sales to ten customers. During 2015 one customer accounted for 10% or more of our sales as compared to no one customer accounting for 10% for the year ended December 31, 2014. Over the last several years, there have been consolidations in the industries we serve that may increase our sales concentration and the related risks. Any material reduction in sales to any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our sales contracts tend to be short term in nature. We typically sell our products on monthly or quarterly customer commitments. As a result, the relationship, as well as particular orders, can generally be terminated with relatively little advance notice. The loss of any one of our major customers or decrease in demand by those customers or credit constraints placed on them could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe counterparties to our commodity derivative instruments may not be able to perform their obligations to us, which could materially affect our cash flows and results of operations.\nIn order to minimize risk associated with fluctuations in commodity prices and foreign currency, we use derivative instruments to hedge metal pricing and foreign currency risk as we deem appropriate for a majority of our purchase and sales contracts. We are exposed to the risk of a counterparty default in fulfilling these derivative instruments. Should there be a counterparty default, we could be exposed to losses on the original derivative instrument or be unable to recover anticipated gains from the transactions, which could result in decreased gross margins, profitability and/or outright losses.\n- 9 -\nAlthough we expect to finance our future and in-process growth initiatives through borrowings under our credit facility, we may have to find additional sources of funding, which could be difficult. Additionally, increased leverage could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nWe expect to finance our future and in-process growth initiatives through borrowings under our $275 million secured, asset-based credit facility. However, our credit facility may not be sufficient or available to finance our growth initiatives, and we may have to find additional sources of financing. It may be difficult for us in the future to obtain the necessary funds and liquidity to run and expand our business.\nAdditionally, if we incur substantial additional debt, including under our credit facility, to finance future growth, our leverage could increase as could the risks associated with such leverage. A high degree of leverage could have important consequences to us. For example, it could:\n\u00b7 increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u00b7 require us to dedicate a substantial portion of cash from operations to the payment of debt service, thereby reducing the availability of cash to fund working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and other general corporate purposes;\n\u00b7 limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, general corporate purposes or acquisitions;\n\u00b7 place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged; and\n\u00b7 limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our existing debt service obligations.\nOur ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations will depend on our future financial performance, which will be affected by a range of economic, competitive and business factors, many of which are outside of our control. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy our debt obligations, we may be required to undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our debt, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital investments or seek to raise additional capital. We may not be able to consummate any such transaction at all or on a timely basis or on terms, and for proceeds, that are acceptable to us, and these transactions may not be permitted under the terms of our various debt instruments then in effect. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations or to timely refinance our obligations on acceptable terms could adversely affect our ability to serve our customers and could cause us to reduce or discontinue our planned operations.\nWe service industries that are highly cyclical, and any downturn in our customers\u2019 demand could reduce our sales, margins and profitability.\nMany of our products are sold to customers in industries that experience significant fluctuations in demand based on economic conditions, energy prices, consumer demand, availability of adequate credit and financing, customer inventory levels, changes in governmental policies (including those that would limit or reduce defense spending) and other factors beyond our control. When one or more of our customers\u2019 industries experiences a decline, we may have difficulty increasing or maintaining our level of sales or profitability if we are not able to divert sales of our products to customers in other industries.\nWe are vulnerable to interest rate fluctuations on our indebtedness, which could hurt our operating results.\nWe are exposed to various interest rate risks as a result of our indebtedness under our credit facility. Market risk arises from changes in variable interest rates of our borrowings, which are primarily short-term LIBOR or money market based loans, which are subject to change. If interest rates significantly increase, we could be unable to service our debt, or we would have to dedicate materially more of our resources toward debt service, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\n- 10 -\nWe are dependent on our executive officers and key employees.\nWe are highly dependent on the management and leadership skills of our executive officers and other key employees, including Nathan Kahn, our chief executive officer, president and a director, Sandra Kahn, our vice president, chief financial officer and a director, and Harvey Wrubel, our vice president of sales/director of marketing and a director. There can be no assurance that these individuals will continue to provide services to us. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees or the failure to attract and retain additional qualified personnel could prevent us from implementing our business strategy and continuing to grow our business at a rate necessary to maintain future profitability.\nMany of our suppliers and customers are located in international markets, which expose us to a number of risks.\nWe generally purchase metal products from foreign suppliers, and our customers are principally located throughout the Americas, Australia, New Zealand and Europe. Thus, our operations could be materially and adversely affected by changes in economic, political and social conditions in the countries where we currently purchase or sell or may in the future purchase or sell such products, including the potential for adverse change in the local political or social climate or in government policies, laws and regulations, restrictions on imports and exports or sources of supply, and change in duties and taxes.\nIn addition, an act of war or terrorism or major pandemic event could disrupt international shipping schedules, cause additional delays in importing our products into the U.S. or increase the costs required to do so. Acts of crime or violence in these international markets could also adversely affect our operating results. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar versus foreign currencies could reduce the value of these assets as reported in our financial statements, which could reduce our stockholders\u2019 equity. Our failure to adequately anticipate and respond to these risks and the other risks inherent in international operations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and other worldwide and bribery laws.\nWe are subject to the FCPA which prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making payments to non-U.S. government officials for purposes of obtaining or retaining business or securing any other improper advantage. We have policies and procedures in place to ensure that we comply with the FCPA and similar laws; however, there is no assurance that such policies and procedures will protect us against liability under the FCPA or related laws for actions taken by our employees and intermediaries with respect to our business. Failure to comply with the FCPA and related laws could disrupt our business and lead to criminal and civil penalties including fines, suspension of our ability to do business with the federal government and denial of government reimbursement of our products, which could result in a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We could also be adversely affected by any allegation that we violated such laws.\nOur future operating results could be impacted by the volatility of the prices of metals, which could cause our results to be adversely affected.\nThe metal industry is highly cyclical and pricing can be volatile. The prices we pay for metals and the prices we charge our customers may fluctuate depending on many factors, including general economic conditions (both domestic and international), competition, production levels, import duties and other trade restrictions and currency fluctuations. We rely on long-term relationships with our suppliers but generally have no long-term, fixed-price purchase contracts. Instead we purchase at prevailing market prices at the time orders are placed, typically with discounts for quantity purchases. To the extent metal prices decline, we would generally expect lower sales and possibly lower net income, depending on the timing of the price changes and the ability to pass price changes on to our customers. To the extent we are not able to pass on to our customers any increases in our raw materials prices, our operating results may be adversely affected. In addition, because we maintain substantial inventories of metals in order to meet short lead-times and the just-in-time delivery requirements of our customers, a reduction in our selling prices could result in lower profitability or, in some cases, losses, either of which could adversely impact our ability to remain in compliance with certain financial covenants in our loan facilities, as well as result in us incurring impairment charges.\nIf suppliers fail to provide products of sufficient quality, customer relationships and prices could be negatively affected.\nOur relationships with our customers depend, in part, on our ability to deliver products of the quality specified by those customers. We rely on certifications from our suppliers that attest to the quality of the metals received from those suppliers for resale and generally, consistent with industry practice, do not undertake independent testing of such metals. In the event that metal purchased from suppliers is deemed defective material or deemed to not meet quality specifications as set forth in the certifications or customer specifications, we may be forced to buy products of the specified quality from another source to fulfill the customer\u2019s order. While we would then be left with a claim against the supplier for any loss sustained by us, we may not be able to bring these claims successfully, particularly in foreign jurisdictions. In addition, we could suffer damage to our reputation that may arise from sub-standard products and possibly lose customers.\n- 11 -\nWe are exposed to credit risk from our customers.\nWe do not require collateral for customer receivables. We have significant balances owing from customers that operate in cyclical industries and under leveraged conditions, which may impair our collection of these receivables. We carry credit insurance with a 10% deductible covering the majority of our customers, and we have set specific limits on each customer\u2019s receivables. However, we sometimes elect to exceed these specific credit limits, and in selected instances the co-pay may be increased. Our failure to collect a significant portion of the amount due on our receivables directly from customers or through insurance claims (or other material default by customers) could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to the risk of default by our customers.\nWe rely on our customers to fulfill contractual obligations. The failure of our customers to do so may expose us to serious losses and may force us to sell material at a loss in the open market and/or absorb losses for metal hedges applied to the defaulting customer\u2019s transaction. A default by a single customer or multiple customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could be held liable for any product failures related to the products we manufactured at our extrusion facility or for products manufactured by our suppliers.\nAs a result of the production that took place at our extrusion facility prior to September 2009, when we ceased production at the facility, we may be exposed to potentially serious risks such as product failure following distribution in the market. While we are not aware of any defects in our aluminum extrusion products, defects in the products that we manufactured may result in serious and potentially fatal accidents which may in turn result in substantial losses to us. Additionally, we may be exposed to risks as a result of product failures by the products we import.\nSignificant changes to international trade regulations could adversely affect our results of operations.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, approximately 17% and 15%, respectively, of our purchases of aluminum products were from countries whose exports were eligible for preferential tariff treatment for import into the U.S. under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (\u201cAGOA\u201d) and the Generalized System of Preferences (\u201cGSP\u201d). GSP expired on July 31, 2013, and was reinstated retroactively on June 29, 2015. If preferential tariff treatment of any of our suppliers that are currently eligible for such treatment under AGOA becomes unavailable, then imports from such supplier may be subjected to a tariff instead of the duty-free treatment those imports now enjoy. To the extent that these increased costs could not be passed on to our customers, our profit margins could suffer. In fact, one of our suppliers, PT. Alumindo Light Metal Industry, exceeded the quota of imports permitted under the GSP statute during 2011, and triggered the Competitive Needs Limit of the GSP program. As a result, imports from PT. Alumindo Light Metal Industry are subject to a 3% duty as of July 1, 2012. This increase in duty rate, along with other duty increases imposed on our other suppliers, could adversely affect our profit margins to the extent these increased costs cannot be passed on to our customers, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAntidumping and other duties could be imposed on us, our suppliers and our products.\nThe imposition of an antidumping or other increased duty on any products that we import in any of our markets, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. For example, under U.S. law, an antidumping duty may be imposed on any imports if two conditions are met. First, the Department of Commerce must decide that the imports are being sold in the U.S. at less than fair value. Second, the International Trade Commission must determine that the U.S. industry is materially injured or threatened with material injury by reason of the imports. The International Trade Commission\u2019s determination of injury involves a two-prong inquiry: first, whether the industry is materially injured, and second, whether the dumping, not other factors, caused the injury. The International Trade Commission is required to analyze the volume of imports, the effect of imports on U.S. prices for like merchandise, and the effects the imports have on U.S. producers of like products, taking into account many factors, including lost sales, market share, profits, productivity, return on investment, and utilization of production capacity.\n- 12 -\nGeneral global economic, credit and capital market conditions have had and could continue to have an adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe are susceptible to macroeconomic downturns in the U.S. and abroad which have had, and in the future may continue to have, an adverse effect on demand for our products and our customers\u2019 ability to pay for the products ordered and consequently impact our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Future negative economic conditions, could lead to reduced demand for our products, increased price competition, reduced gross margins, increased risk of obsolete inventories and higher operating costs as a percentage of revenue.\nDisruption of the capital and credit markets may negatively impact our business, including our ability to access additional financing at a time when we would like, or need, to access those markets to run or expand our business. These events may also make it more costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of our equity securities and could reduce our net income by increasing our interest expense and other costs of capital. The diminished availability of credit and other capital could also affect the industries we serve and could result in reduction in sales volumes and increased credit and collection risks.\nOur industry is highly competitive, which may force us to lower our prices and may have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nThe principal markets that we serve are highly competitive. Competition is based principally on price, service, quality, processing capabilities, inventory availability and timely delivery. Many of our competitors are significantly larger than us, and many have captive sources of supply and significantly greater access to capital and other resources or may choose to sell products below market pricing or below their own costs. Increased competition could lower our margins or reduce our market share and have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. Additionally, if our sources of supply were interrupted, our competitors could be in a position to capture our customers.\nIncreases in energy prices would increase our operating costs, and we may be unable to pass all these increases on to our customers in the form of higher prices.\nIf our energy costs increase disproportionately to our revenues, our earnings could be reduced. We use energy to transport our products. Our operating costs increase if energy costs, including electricity, diesel fuel and natural gas, rise. During periods of higher energy costs, we may not be able to recover our operating cost increases through price increases without reducing demand for our products. In addition, we generally do not hedge our exposure to higher energy prices. Increases in energy prices will increase our operating costs and may reduce our profitability if we are unable to pass all of the increases on to our customers.\nRising freight rate costs and lack of adequate cargo space may affect our operations.\nSubstantially all of the products we distribute require transportation, either through ocean vessels, rail or trucks. Increasing freight rates may materially adversely affect our profit margin and lack of cargo space may affect our ability to deliver products in a timely manner. Further, labor disruptions affecting ports or any of the means of transportation and handling we use to deliver our products may have an adverse effect on our margins and overall competitive position.\nThe failure of our key computer-based systems could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe currently maintain computer-based systems in the operation of our business and we depend on these systems to a significant degree for all areas of business operations. These systems are vulnerable to, among other things, damage or interruption from fire, flood, tornado, and other natural disasters, power loss, computer system and network failures, operator negligence, physical and electronic loss of data or security breaches and computer viruses. The destruction or failure of any one of our computer-based systems for any significant period of time could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may face risks associated with current or future litigation and claims.\nAlthough we do not believe that we currently face any material litigation or claims, there can be no guarantee that we will not, in the future, be involved in one or more lawsuits, claims or other proceedings. These suits could concern issues including contract disputes, employment actions, employee benefits, taxes, environmental, health and safety, personal injury and product liability matters. Due to the uncertainties of litigation, we can give no assurance that we will prevail on any claims made against us in any such lawsuit. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of any pending lawsuits and claims, we do not believe that the disposition of any such pending matters is likely to have an adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity, although the resolution in any reporting period of one of more of these matters could have an adverse effect on our operating results for that period. Also, we can give no assurance that any other lawsuits or claims brought in the future will not have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity or operating results.\n- 13 -\nRisks Related our Common Stock\nThe interests of our controlling stockholders may not coincide with yours and such controlling stockholder may make decisions with which you may disagree.\nAs of March 21, 2016, Nathan Kahn, our chief executive officer, president and a director, and Sandra Kahn, our vice president, chief financial officer and a director, beneficially owned approximately 46.7% of our outstanding common stock (43.4% excluding the 10% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes Due June 1, 2016, which only have voting rights once they are converted to common stock) and Harvey Wrubel, our vice president of sales/director of marketing and a director, beneficially owns approximately 3%. In addition, through ownership of our 10% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes Due June 1, 2016, Leon G. Cooperman and his affiliates beneficially own (i.e., have the right acquire) approximately 19% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, our controlling stockholders control substantially all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. In addition, this concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change in control of our company and make some future transactions more difficult or impossible without the support of our controlling stockholders. The interests of our controlling stockholders may not coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders.\nOur common stock may be affected by limited trading volume and price fluctuations, each of which could adversely impact the value of our common stock.\nHistorically, there has been relatively limited trading volume in our common stock. As such, our common stock has experienced, and is likely to experience in the future, significant price and volume fluctuations, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock without regard to our operating performance. In addition, we believe that factors such as quarterly fluctuations in our financial results and changes in the overall economy or the condition of the financial markets could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. These fluctuations may also cause short sellers to enter the market from time to time in the belief that we will have poor results in the future. We cannot predict the actions of market participants and, therefore, can offer no assurances that the market for our stock will be stable or appreciate over time.\nOur stock price may be volatile, which could result in substantial losses for investors.\nThe market price of our common stock is highly volatile and could fluctuate widely in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u00b7 additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u00b7 sales of our common stock, including management shares;\n\u00b7 our ability to execute our business plan;\n\u00b7 operating results that fall below expectations;\n\u00b7 loss of any strategic relationship;\n\u00b7 industry developments; and\n\u00b7 general domestic or international economic, market and political conditions.\nIn addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also significantly affect the market price of our common stock.\n- 14 -\nA significant number of our shares are eligible for sale and their sale or potential sale may depress the market price of our common stock.\nSales of a significant number of shares of our common stock in the public market could harm the market price of our common stock. In particular, all of our currently outstanding shares of common stock are freely tradeable unless they are purchased by our \u201caffiliates,\u201d as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and 2,901,686 shares of common stock issuable at December 31, 2015 upon the conversion of our 10% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes Due June 1, 2016 are currently freely tradable pursuant to an effective registration statement.\nIn addition, 50,000 shares are issuable upon exercise of options. If any options are exercised, the shares issued upon exercise will be restricted, but may be sold under Rule 144 after the applicable holding period has been satisfied and the satisfaction of certain other conditions.\nIn addition to the possibility that actual sales of significant amounts of our common stock in the public market could harm our common stock price, the fact that our stockholders have the ability to make such sales could create a circumstance commonly referred to as an \u201coverhang,\u201d in anticipation of which the market price of our common stock could fall. The existence of an overhang, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional financing through the sale of equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate.\nAlthough we have paid dividends in prior periods, there can be no assurance that we will pay dividends in the future. As a result, any return on investment may be limited to the value of our common stock.\nAlthough we have paid dividends in prior periods, there can be no assurance that we will pay dividends in the future. The payment of dividends on our common stock will depend on our earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors as our board of directors may consider relevant. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because a return on your investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not currently have research coverage by securities and industry analysts and you should not invest in our common stock in anticipation that we will obtain such coverage. If we obtain securities or industry analyst coverage and if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management\u2019s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations has increased and will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly, and increase demand on our systems and resources. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. As a result, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business and operating results. We may need to hire more employees in the future, which will increase our costs and expenses.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.\n- 15 -\nWe also expect that being a public company that is subject to these rules and regulations could make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors and qualified executive officers.\nWe are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal controls over financial reporting. We may not complete our analysis of our internal controls over financial reporting in a timely manner, or these internal controls may not be determined to be effective, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nWe are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for fiscal 2015. This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting.\nThese reporting and other obligations place significant demands on our management, administrative, operational, internal audit and accounting resources. Any failure to maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and stock price. Moreover, effective internal control is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, we may not be able to manage our business as effectively as we would if an effective control environment existed, and our business and reputation with investors may be harmed. In addition, if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would cause the price of our common stock to decline.", "PERMNO": 84030, "SIC": 5051, "TIC": "ERS"}
