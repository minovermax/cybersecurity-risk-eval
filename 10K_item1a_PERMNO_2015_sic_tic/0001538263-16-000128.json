{"cik": "1538263", "company": "HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-09-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock is subject to risks inherent in our business. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included in this report. In addition to the risks and uncertainties described below, other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The value or market price of our common stock could decline due to any of these identified or other risks, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nChanges in economic conditions, particularly a further economic slowdown in our primary market areas, could hurt our business.\nOur primary market areas are concentrated in North Carolina (including the Asheville metropolitan area, the \u201cPiedmont\u201d region, Charlotte, Raleigh), South Carolina (Greenville), East Tennessee (including Kingsport/Johnson City, Knoxville, and Morristown) and the Roanoke Valley area of Virginia. Adverse economic conditions in our market areas can reduce our rate of growth, affect our customers\u2019 ability to repay loans and adversely impact our financial condition and earnings. General economic conditions, including inflation, unemployment and money supply fluctuations, also may affect our profitability adversely. Weak economic conditions and ongoing strains in the financial and housing markets have resulted in higher levels of loan and lease delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures and a decline in the values of the collateral securing our loans.\nAlthough the U.S. economy and housing market, including in our market areas, appears to be improving, deterioration in economic conditions, particularly within our primary market areas could result in the following consequences, among others, any of which could materially hurt our business:\n\u2022\nloan delinquencies may increase;\n\u2022\nproblem assets and foreclosures may increase;\n\u2022\ndemand for our products and services may decline;\n\u2022\ncollateral for our loans may decline in value, in turn reducing a customer\u2019s borrowing power and reducing the value of collateral securing our loans; and\n\u2022\nthe net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us.\nAt June 30, 2016, the most significant portion of our loans located outside of our primary market areas was HELOCs-purchased totaling $144.4 million, or 7.9% of our loan portfolio, secured by one-to-four family properties located primarily in several western states. As a result, our financial condition and results of operations will be subject to general economic conditions and the real estate conditions prevailing in the markets in which the underlying properties securing these loans are located, as well as the conditions in our primary market areas. If economic conditions or if the real estate market declines in the areas in which these properties are located, we may suffer decreased net income or losses associated with higher default rates and decreased collateral values on our existing portfolio. Further, because of their geographical diversity, these loans can be more difficult to oversee than loans in our market areas in the event of delinquency.\nA continued weak economic recovery or a return to recessionary conditions could increase our level of nonperforming assets, lower real estate values in our market and reduce demand for loans, which would result in increased loan losses and lower earnings.\nEconomic conditions have improved since the end of the economic recession that officially ended in June, 2009, however, economic growth has been slow and uneven, unemployment remains high and concerns still exist over the federal deficit, and government spending, which have all contributed to diminished expectations for the economy. A return of recessionary conditions and/or negative developments in the domestic and international credit markets may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the value of our loans and investments, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability. Declines in real estate values and sales volumes and high unemployment levels may result in higher than expected loan delinquencies and a decline in demand for our products and services. These negative events may cause us to incur losses and may adversely affect our capital, liquidity, and financial condition.\nFurthermore, the Federal Reserve, in an attempt to help the economy, has, among other things, kept interest rates low through its targeted federal funds rate and the purchase of U.S. Treasury and mortgage-backed securities. The Federal Reserve has recently increased the federal funds rate by 25 basis points and indicated further increases in the rate could occur in 2016. As the federal funds rate increases, market interest rates would likely rise, which may negatively affect the housing markets and the U.S. economic recovery. In addition, deflationary pressures, while possibly lowering our operating costs, could have a significant negative effect on our borrowers, especially our business borrowers, and the values of underlying collateral securing loans, which could negatively affect our financial performance.\nOur business may be adversely affected by credit risk associated with residential property.\nAt June 30, 2016, $623.7 million, or 34.0% of our total loan portfolio, was secured by first liens on one-to-four family residential loans. In addition, at June 30, 2016, our home equity lines of credit totaled $307.7 million or 16.8% of our total loan portfolio. These types of loans are generally sensitive to regional and local economic conditions that significantly impact the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations, making loss levels difficult to predict. A decline in residential real estate values resulting from a downturn in the housing market may reduce the value of the real estate collateral securing these types of loans and increase our risk of loss if borrowers default on their loans. Recessionary conditions or declines in the volume of real estate sales and/or the sales prices coupled with elevated unemployment rates may result in higher than expected loan delinquencies or problem assets, and a decline in demand for our products and services. These potential negative events may cause us to incur losses, adversely affect our capital and liquidity, and damage our financial condition and business operations.\nHigh loan-to-value ratios on a portion of our residential mortgage loan portfolio exposes us to greater risk of loss.\nMany of our one-to-four family loans and home equity lines of credit are secured by liens on mortgage properties in which the borrowers have little or no equity because of these declines in home values in our market areas. Residential loans with high combined loan-to-value ratios will be more sensitive to declining property values than those with lower combined loan-to-value ratios and therefore may experience a higher incidence of default and severity of losses. In addition, if the borrowers sell their homes, they may be unable to repay their loans in full from the sale. Further, the majority of our home equity lines of credit consist of second mortgage loans. For those home equity lines secured by a second mortgage, it is unlikely that we will be successful in recovering all or a portion of our loan proceeds in the event of default unless we are prepared to repay the first mortgage loan and such repayment and the costs associated with a foreclosure are justified by the value of the property. For these reasons, we may experience higher rates of delinquencies, defaults and losses.\nOur non-owner-occupied real estate loans may expose us to increased credit risk.\nAt June 30, 2016, $91.6 million, or 14.6%, of our one-to-four family loans and 5.0% of our total loan portfolio, consisted of loans secured by non-owner-occupied residential properties. Loans secured by non-owner-occupied properties generally expose a lender to greater risk of non-payment and loss than loans secured by owner-occupied properties because repayment of such loans depend primarily on the tenant\u2019s continuing ability to pay rent to the property owner, who is our borrower, or, if the property owner is unable to find a tenant, the property owner\u2019s ability to repay the loan without the benefit of a rental income stream. In addition, the physical condition of non-owner-occupied properties is often below that of owner-occupied properties due to lax property maintenance standards, which has a negative impact on the value of the collateral properties. Furthermore, some of our non-owner-occupied residential loan borrowers have more than one loan outstanding with HomeTrust Bank which may expose us to a greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to an owner-occupied residential mortgage loan.\nOur construction and development loans and construction and land/lot loans have a higher risk of loss than residential or commercial real estate loans.\nAt June 30, 2016, construction and land/lot loans in our retail consumer loan portfolio was $38.1 million, or 2.1%, of our total loan portfolio, and consists primarily of construction to permanent loans to homeowners building a residence or developing lots in residential subdivisions intending to construct a residence within one year. Construction and development loans in our commercial loan portfolio at June 30, 2016, totaled $86.8 million, or 4.7%, of our total loan portfolio, and consists of loans to contractors and builders primarily to finance the construction of single and multi-family homes, subdivisions, as well as commercial properties. We originate these loans whether or not the collateral property underlying the loan is under contract for sale.\nConstruction and development lending generally involves additional risks because funds are advanced upon estimates of costs in relation to values associated with the completed project. Construction and development lending involves additional risks when compared with permanent residential lending because funds are advanced upon the collateral for the project based on an estimate of costs that will produce a future value at completion. Because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs, as well as the market value of the complete project and the effects of governmental regulation on real property, it is relatively difficult to evaluate accurately the total funds required to complete a project and the completed project loan-to-value ratio. Changes in demand for new housing and higher than anticipated building costs, may cause actual results to vary significantly from those estimated. For these reasons, this type of lending also typically involves higher loan principal amounts and is often concentrated with a small number of builders. A downturn in housing, or the real estate market, could increase loan delinquencies, defaults and foreclosures, and significantly impair the value of our collateral and our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure. Some of the builders we deal with have more than one loan outstanding with us. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss.\nIn addition, during the term of some of our construction and development loans, no payment from the borrower is required since the accumulated interest is added to the principal of the loan through an interest reserve. As a result, these loans often involve the disbursement of funds with repayment substantially dependent on the success of the ultimate project and the ability of the borrower to sell or lease the property or obtain permanent take-out financing, rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest. If our appraisal of the value of a completed project proves to be overstated, we may have inadequate security for the repayment of the loan upon completion of construction of the project and may incur a loss. Because construction loans require active monitoring of the building process, including cost comparisons and on-site inspections, these loans are more difficult and costly to monitor. Increases in market rates of interest may have a more pronounced effect on construction loans by rapidly increasing the end-purchasers' borrowing costs, thereby reducing the overall demand for the project. Properties under construction are often difficult to sell and typically must be completed in order to be successfully sold which also complicates the process of working out problem construction loans. This may require us to advance additional funds and/or contract with another builder to complete construction and assume the market risk of selling the project at a future market price, which may or may not enable us to fully recover unpaid loan funds and associated construction and liquidation costs. Furthermore, in the case of speculative construction loans, there is the added risk associated with identifying an end-purchaser for the finished project. At June 30, 2016, $12.2 million of our construction and development loans were for speculative construction loans and $1.4 million or 1.6%, of our construction and development loans were classified as nonaccruing.\nOur commercial real estate loans involve higher principal amounts than other loans and repayment of these loans may be dependent on factors outside our control or the control of our borrowers.\nWhile commercial real estate lending may potentially be more profitable than single-family residential lending, it is generally more sensitive to regional and local economic conditions, making loss levels more difficult to predict. Collateral evaluation and financial statement analysis in these types of loans require a more detailed analysis at the time of loan underwriting and on an ongoing basis. At June 30, 2016, commercial real estate loans were $486.6 million, or 26.6% of our total loan portfolio, including multifamily loans totaling $63.9 million or 3.5% of our total loan portfolio. These loans typically involve higher principal amounts than other types of loans and some of our commercial borrowers have more than one loan outstanding with us. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one-to-four family residential mortgage loan. Repayment of these loans is dependent upon income being generated from the property securing the loan in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service, which may be adversely affected by changes in the economy or local market conditions. Commercial real estate loans also expose a lender to greater credit risk than loans secured by one-to-four family residential real estate because the collateral securing these loans typically cannot be sold as easily as residential real estate. In addition, many of our commercial real estate loans are not fully amortizing and contain large balloon payments upon maturity. Such balloon payments may require the borrower to either sell or refinance the underlying property in order to make the payment, which may increase the risk of default or non-payment. At June 30, 2016, commercial real estate loans that were nonperforming were $3.2 million, or 17.4% of our total nonperforming loans.\nA secondary market for most types of commercial real estate loans is not readily available, so we have less opportunity to mitigate credit risk by selling part or all of our interest in these loans. As a result of these characteristics, if we foreclose on a commercial real estate loan, our holding period for the collateral typically is longer than for one-to-four family residential loans because there are fewer potential purchasers of the collateral. Accordingly, charge-offs on commercial real estate loans may be larger on a per loan basis than those incurred with our residential and consumer loan portfolios.\nOur increased auto finance lending increases our exposure to increased lending risks.\nAt June 30, 2016, $108.5 million, or 5.9%, of our total loan portfolio consisted of indirect auto finance loans originated by us. Indirect auto finance loans are inherently risky as they are secured by assets that depreciate rapidly. In some cases, repossessed collateral for a defaulted automobile loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan and the remaining deficiency may not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower. Automobile loan collections depend on the borrower\u2019s continuing financial stability, and therefore, are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness, or personal bankruptcy. In addition, our ability to originate loans is reliant on our relationships with automotive dealers. In particular, our automotive finance operations depend in large part upon our ability to establish and maintain relationships with reputable automotive dealers that direct customers to our offices or originate loans at the point-of-sale. Although we have relationships with certain automotive dealers, none of our relationships are exclusive and any may be terminated at any time. If our existing dealer base experiences decreased sales we may experience decreased loan volume in the future, which may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nRepayment of our municipal leases is dependent on the fire department receiving tax revenues from the county/municipality.\nAt June 30, 2016, municipal leases were $103.2 million, or 5.6%, of our total loan portfolio. We offer ground and equipment lease financing to fire departments located throughout North Carolina and, to a lesser extent, South Carolina. Repayment of our municipal leases is often dependent on the tax revenues collected by the county/municipality on behalf of the fire department. Although a municipal lease does not constitute a general obligation of the county/municipality for which the county/municipality's taxing power is pledged, a municipal lease is ordinarily backed by the county/municipality's covenant to budget for, appropriate and pay the tax revenues to the fire department. However, certain municipal leases contain \"non-appropriation\" clauses which provide that the municipality has no obligation to make lease or installment purchase payments in future years unless money is appropriated for that purpose on a yearly basis. In the case of a \"non-appropriation\" lease, our ability to recover under the lease in the event of non-appropriation or default will be limited solely to the repossession of the leased property, without recourse to the general credit of the lessee, and disposition or releasing of the property might prove difficult. At June 30, 2016, $3.0 million of our municipal leases contained a non-appropriation clause.\nOur allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses in our loan portfolio.\nLending money is a substantial part of our business and each loan carries a certain risk that it will not be repaid in accordance with its terms, or that any underlying collateral will not be sufficient to assure repayment. This risk is affected by, among other things:\n\u2022\ncash flow of the borrower and/or the project being financed;\n\u2022\nthe changes and uncertainties as to the future value of the collateral, in the case of a collateralized loan;\n\u2022\nthe duration of the loan;\n\u2022\nthe character and creditworthiness of a particular borrower; and\n\u2022\nchanges in economic and industry conditions.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses, which we believe is an appropriate reserve to provide for probable losses in our loan portfolio. The allowance is funded by provisions for loan losses charged to expense. The amount of this allowance is determined by our management through periodic reviews and consideration of several factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nour general reserve, based on our historical default and loss experience, certain macroeconomic factors, and management\u2019s expectations of future events;\n\u2022\nour specific reserve, based on our evaluation of nonaccruing loans and their underlying collateral; and\n\u2022\nan unallocated reserve to provide for other credit losses inherent in our portfolio that may not have been contemplated in the other loss factors.\nWe make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we review our loans and our loss and delinquency experience, and we evaluate economic conditions. If our assumptions are incorrect, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover probable incurred losses in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions to our allowance for loan losses through the provision for losses on loans which is charged against income.\nAdditionally, pursuant to our growth strategy, management recognizes that significant new growth in loan portfolios, new loan products and the refinancing of existing loans can result in portfolios comprised of unseasoned loans that may not perform in a historical or projected manner and will increase the risk that our allowance may be insufficient to absorb losses without significant additional provisions. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for possible loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management. In addition, if charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan losses we will need additional provisions to replenish the allowance for loan losses. Any additional provisions will result in a decrease in net income and possibly capital, and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our nonperforming assets increase, our earnings will be adversely affected.\nOur nonperforming assets (which consist of nonaccruing loans and REO) were $24.5 million, or 0.9%, of total assets at June 30, 2016, compared to $31.9 million, or 1.15% of total assets, and $52.6 million, or 2.5% of total assets, at June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our nonperforming assets adversely affect our net income in various ways:\n\u2022\nwe record interest income only on a cash basis for nonaccrual loans and any nonperforming investment securities; and do not record interest income for REO;\n\u2022\nwe must provide for probable loan losses through a current period charge to the provision for loan losses;\n\u2022\nnoninterest expense increases when we write down the value of properties in our REO portfolio to reflect changing market values or recognize other-than-temporary impairment (\u201cOTTI\u201d) on nonperforming investment securities;\n\u2022\nthere are legal fees associated with the resolution of problem assets, as well as, carrying costs, such as taxes, insurance, and maintenance fees related to our REO; and\n\u2022\nthe resolution of nonperforming assets requires the active involvement of management, which can distract them from more profitable activity.\nIf additional borrowers become delinquent and do not pay their loans and we are unable to successfully manage our nonperforming assets, our losses and troubled assets could increase significantly, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We have also classified $28.3 million in loans as performing troubled debt restructurings at June 30, 2016.\nTo meet our growth objectives we may originate or purchase loans outside of our market areas which could affect the level of our net interest margin and nonperforming loans.\nIn order to achieve our desired loan portfolio growth, we opportunistically purchase loans outside of our primary market areas either individually, through participations, or in bulk or \u201cpools\u201d. We perform certain due diligence procedures and may re-underwrite these loans to our underwriting standards prior to purchase, and anticipate acquiring loans subject to customary limited indemnities, however, we may be exposed to a greater risk of loss as we acquire loans of a type or in geographic areas where management may not have substantial prior experience and which may be more difficult for us to monitor. During the years ended June 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014 we purchased $120.6 million, $95.0 million and $16.1 million of loans, respectively. Loan pools purchased in the past three years consisted primarily of home equity loans secured by single family residential properties located in several western states, most of which are still in our loan portfolio. When determining the purchase price we are willing to pay to acquire loans, management will make certain assumptions about, among other things, if and how much borrowers will prepay their loans, the real estate market and our ability to collect loans successfully and, if necessary, when and how to dispose of any real estate that may be acquired through foreclosure. To the extent that our underlying assumptions prove to be inaccurate or the basis for those assumptions change (such as an unanticipated decline in the real estate market), the purchase price paid may prove to have been excessive, resulting in a lower yield or a loss of some or all of the loan principal. For example, if we purchase \u201cpools\u201d of loans at a premium and some of the loans are prepaid before we anticipate, we will earn less interest income on the acquired loans than expected. Our success in increasing our loan portfolio through loan purchases will depend on our ability to price the loans properly and on general economic conditions in the geographic areas where the underlying properties or collateral for the loans acquired are located. Inaccurate estimates or declines in economic conditions or real estate values in the markets where we purchase loans could significantly adversely affect the level of our nonperforming loans and our results of operations.\nIf our REO is not properly valued or sufficiently reserved to cover actual losses, or if we are required to increase our valuation reserves, our earnings could be reduced.\nWe obtain updated valuations in the form of appraisals and broker price opinions when a loan has been foreclosed and the property taken in as REO and at certain other times during the asset\u2019s holding period. Our net book value (\u201cNBV\u201d) in the loan at the time of foreclosure and thereafter is compared to the updated market value of the foreclosed property less estimated selling costs (fair value). A charge-off is recorded for any excess in the asset\u2019s NBV over its fair value. If our valuation process is incorrect, or if property values decline, the fair value of our REO may not be sufficient to recover our carrying value in such assets, resulting in the need for additional charge-offs.\nSignificant charge-offs to our REO could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, bank regulators periodically review our REO and may require us to recognize further charge-offs. Any increase in our charge-offs may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur securities portfolio may be negatively impacted by fluctuations in market value and interest rates.\nOur securities portfolio may be impacted by fluctuations in market value, potentially reducing accumulated other comprehensive income and/or earnings. Fluctuations in market value may be caused by changes in market interest rates, lower market prices for securities and limited investor demand. Our securities portfolio is evaluated for OTTI. If this evaluation shows impairment to the actual or projected cash flows associated with one or more securities, a potential loss to earnings may occur. Changes in interest rates can also have an adverse effect on our financial condition, as our available-for-sale securities are reported at their estimated fair value, and therefore are impacted by fluctuations in interest rates. We increase or decrease our shareholders' equity by the amount of change in the estimated fair value of the available-for-sale securities, net of taxes. There can be no assurance that the declines in market value will not result in other-than-temporary impairments of these assets, which would lead to accounting charges that could have a material adverse effect on our net income and capital levels.\nAn increase in interest rates, change in the programs offered by secondary market purchasers or our ability to qualify for their programs may reduce our mortgage banking revenues, which would negatively impact our noninterest income.\nOur mortgage banking operations provide a significant portion of our noninterest income. We generate mortgage revenues primarily from gains on the sale of single-family mortgage loans pursuant to programs currently offered by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae and non-GSE investors. These entities account for a substantial portion of the secondary market in residential mortgage loans. Any future changes in these programs, our eligibility to participate in such programs, the criteria for loans to be accepted or laws that significantly affect the activity of such entities could, in turn, materially adversely affect our results of operations. Mortgage banking is generally considered a volatile source of income because it depends largely on the level of loan volume which, in turn, depends largely on prevailing market interest rates. In a rising or higher interest rate environment, our originations of mortgage loans may decrease, resulting in fewer loans that are available to be sold to investors. This would result in a decrease in mortgage banking revenues and a corresponding decrease in noninterest income. In addition, our results of operations are affected by the amount of noninterest expense associated with mortgage banking activities, such as salaries and employee benefits, occupancy, equipment and data processing expense and other operating costs. During periods of reduced loan demand, our results of operations may be adversely affected to the extent that we are unable to reduce expenses commensurate with the decline in loan originations. In addition, although we sell loans into the secondary market without recourse, we are required to give customary representations and warranties about the loans to the buyers. If we breach those representations and warranties, the buyers may require us to repurchase the loans and we may incur a loss on the repurchase.\nFluctuating interest rates can adversely affect our profitability.\nOur earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Federal Reserve. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and investments and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, but these changes could also affect (i) our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, (ii) the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities, which could negatively impact shareholders' equity, and our ability to realize gains from the sale of such assets; (iii) our ability to obtain and retain deposits in competition with other available investment alternatives; (iv) the ability of our borrowers to repay adjustable or variable rate loans; and (v) the average duration of our mortgage-backed securities portfolio and other interest-earning assets. If the interest rates paid on deposits and borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, our net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. As a result of the relatively low interest rate environment, an increasing percentage of our deposits have been comprised of short-term time deposits and other deposits yielding no or a relatively low rate of interest. At June 30, 2016, we had $325.5 million in certificates of deposit that mature within one year and $1.4 billion in checking, savings, and money market accounts. We would incur a higher cost of funds to retain these deposits in a rising interest rate environment. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and borrowings.\nA prolonged period of exceptionally low market interest rates, such as we are currently experiencing, limits our ability to lower our interest expense, while the average yield on our interest-earning assets may decrease as our loans reprice or are originated at these low market rates. Accordingly, our net interest income may decrease, which may have an adverse effect on our profitability. In addition, a substantial amount of our loans have adjustable interest rates. As a result, these loans may experience a higher rate of default in a rising interest rate environment. Further, a significant portion of our adjustable rate loans have interest rate floors below which the loan\u2019s contractual interest rate may not adjust. As of June 30, 2016, our loans with interest rate floors totaled approximately $577.0 million or 31.5% of our total loan portfolio and had a weighted average floor rate of 4.05% of which $263.0 million, or 45.4%, had yields that would begin floating again once prime rates increase at least 200 basis points. The inability of our loans to adjust downward can contribute to increased income in periods of declining interest rates, although this result is subject to the risks that borrowers may refinance these loans during periods of declining interest rates. Also, when loans are at their floors, there is a further risk that our interest income may not increase as rapidly as our cost of funds during periods of increasing interest rates which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nAlthough management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on our results of operations, any substantial, unexpected or prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Also, our interest rate risk modeling techniques and assumptions likely may not fully predict or capture the impact of actual interest rate changes on our balance sheet. If we are unable to manage interest rate risk effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed.\nLiquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans or other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or the terms of which are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the North Carolina, South Carolina, and/or Tennessee markets in which our loans are concentrated or adverse regulatory action against us. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry. Deposit flows, calls of investment securities and wholesale borrowings, and the prepayment of loans and mortgage-related securities are also strongly influenced by such external factors as the direction of interest rates, whether actual or perceived, and competition for deposits and loans in the markets we serve. Furthermore, changes to the FHLB\u2019s underwriting guidelines for wholesale borrowings or lending policies may limit or restrict our ability to borrow, and could therefore have a significant adverse impact on our liquidity. In addition, the need to replace funds in the event of large-scale withdrawals of brokered deposits could require us to pay significantly higher interest rates on retail deposits or other wholesale funding sources, which could have an adverse impact on our net interest income and net income. A decline in available funding could adversely impact our ability to originate loans, invest in securities, meet our expenses, or to fulfill such obligations as repaying our borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands.\nOur strategy of pursuing acquisitions exposes us to financial, execution and operational risks that could adversely affect us.\nWe are implementing a strategy of supplementing organic growth by acquiring other financial institutions or their businesses that we believe will help us fulfill our strategic objectives and enhance our earnings. There are risks associated with this strategy, however, including the following:\n\u2022\nWe may be exposed to potential asset quality issues or unknown or contingent liabilities of the banks, businesses, assets and liabilities we acquire. If these issues or liabilities exceed our estimates, our results of operations and financial condition may be materially negatively affected;\n\u2022\nPrices at which future acquisitions can be made may not be acceptable to us;\n\u2022\nOur growth initiatives may require us to recruit experienced personnel to assist in such initiatives. The failure to identify and retain such personnel would place significant limitations on our ability to execute our growth strategy;\n\u2022\nOur strategic efforts may divert resources or management\u2019s attention from ongoing business operations and may subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny;\n\u2022\nThe acquisition of other entities generally requires integration of systems, procedures and personnel of the acquired entity into our company to make the transaction economically successful. This integration process is complicated and time consuming and can also be disruptive to the customers of the acquired business. If the integration process is not conducted successfully and with minimal effect on the acquired business and its customers, we may not realize the anticipated economic benefits of particular acquisitions within the expected time frame, and we may lose customers or employees of the acquired business. We may also experience greater than anticipated customer losses even if the integration process is successful;\n\u2022\nTo finance a future acquisition, we may borrow funds, thereby increasing our leverage and diminishing our liquidity, or raise additional capital, which could dilute the interests of our existing shareholders;\n\u2022\nWe have completed four mergers during the past two fiscal years that enhanced our rate of growth. We may not be able to continue to sustain our past rate of growth or to grow at all in the future; and\n\u2022\nWe expect our net income will increase following our acquisitions, however, we also expect our general and administrative expenses and consequently our efficiency rates will also increase. Ultimately, we would expect our efficiency ratio to improve; however, if we are not successful in our integration process, this may not occur, and our acquisitions or branching activities may not be accretive to earnings in the short or long-term.\nThe required accounting treatment of loans we acquire through acquisitions, including purchase credit impaired loans, could result in higher net interest margins and interest income in current periods and lower net interest margins and interest income in future periods.\nUnder U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"), we are required to record loans acquired through acquisitions, including purchase credit impaired loans, at fair value. Estimating the fair value of such loans requires management to make estimates based on available information and facts and circumstances as of the acquisition date. Actual performance could differ from management's initial estimates. If these loans outperform our original fair value estimates, the difference between our original estimate and the actual performance of the loan (the \u201cdiscount\u201d) is accreted into net interest income. Thus, our net interest margins may initially increase due to the discount. We expect the yields on our loans to decline as our acquired loan portfolio pays down or matures and the discount decreases, and we expect downward pressure on our interest income to the extent that the runoff on our acquired loan portfolio is not replaced with comparable high-yielding loans. This could result in higher net interest margins and interest income in current periods and lower net interest rate margins and lower interest income in future periods.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and market areas.\nWe face substantial competition in all phases of our operations from a variety of different competitors. Our future growth and success will depend on our ability to compete effectively in this highly competitive environment. To date, we have been competitive by focusing on our business lines in our market areas and emphasizing the high level of service and responsiveness desired by our customers. We compete for loans, deposits and other financial services with other commercial banks, thrifts, credit unions, brokerage houses, mutual funds, insurance companies and specialized finance companies. Many of our competitors offer products and services which we do not offer, and many have substantially greater resources and lending limits, name recognition and market presence that benefit them in attracting business. In addition, larger competitors may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively than we do, and newer competitors may also be more aggressive in terms of pricing loan and deposit products than we are in order to obtain a share of the market. Some of the financial institutions and financial services organizations with which we compete are not subject to the same degree of regulation as is imposed on bank holding companies, federally insured state-chartered banks and national banks and federal savings banks. As a result, these nonbank competitors have certain advantages over us in accessing funding and in providing various services.\nOur ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including the following:\n\u2022\nthe ability to develop, maintain and build upon long-term customer relationships based on top-quality service, high ethical standards and safe, sound assets;\n\u2022\nthe ability to expand our market position;\n\u2022\nthe scope, relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands;\n\u2022\nthe rate at which we introduce new products and services relative to our competitors;\n\u2022\ncustomer satisfaction with our level of service; and\n\u2022\nindustry and general economic trends.\nFailure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in federal and state laws and regulations that are expected to increase our costs of operations.\nThe financial services industry is extensively regulated. HomeTrust Bank is subject to extensive examination, supervision and comprehensive regulation by the Federal Reserve, our primary federal regulator, the NCCOB, and the FDIC, as insurer of our deposits. As a financial holding company, HomeTrust Bancshares is subject to examination, supervision and regulation by the Federal Reserve. Such regulation and supervision governs the activities in which an institution and its holding company may engage, and are intended primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance fund and consumers and not to benefit our shareholders. These regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the ability to impose restrictions on our operations, the classification of our assets, the determination of the level of our allowance for loan losses, and the level of deposit insurance premiums assessed. Additionally, actions by regulatory agencies or significant litigation against us could require us to devote significant time and resources to defending our business and may lead to penalties that materially affect us. These regulations, along with the currently existing tax, accounting, securities, insurance, and monetary laws, regulations, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations control the methods by which financial institutions conduct business, implement strategic initiatives and tax compliance, and govern financial reporting and disclosures. Because our business is highly regulated, the applicable laws, rules and regulations are subject to constant modification and change, and the laws, rules, and regulations adopted in the future could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, or prospects.\nAs discussed under \u201cBusiness-How We are Regulated-Financial Regulatory Reform\u201d in Item I of this Form 10-K, the Dodd-Frank Act has significantly changed the bank regulatory structure and will affect the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations, and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. The federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting and implementing rules and regulations, and consequently, many of the details and much of the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act may not be known for many months or years. It is difficult at this time to predict when or how any new standards will ultimately be applied to us or what specific impact the Dodd-Frank Act and the yet to be written implementing rules and regulations will have on community banks. However, it is expected that at a minimum they will increase our operating and compliance costs and could increase our interest expense.\nThe CFPB, which was created under the Dodd-Frank Act, has issued a number of final regulations and changes to certain consumer protections under existing laws and continues to issue new rules. These final rules (including the qualified mortgage rule), generally prohibit creditors from extending mortgage loans without regard for the consumers\u2019 ability-to-repay and add restrictions and requirements to mortgage origination and servicing practices. In addition, these rules limit prepayment penalties and require creditors to retain evidence of compliance with the ability-to-repay requirement for three years. Compliance with these rules has increased our overall regulatory compliance costs and may require changes to our underwriting practices with respect to mortgage loans. This includes compliance with the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act Integrated Disclosure (TRID) rule, which combines certain disclosures that consumers receive in connection with applying for and closing a mortgage loan. Moreover, these rules may adversely affect the volume of mortgage loans that we underwrite and may subject us to increased potential liabilities related to such residential loan origination activities. The CFPB has adopted a number of additional requirements and issued additional guidance, including with respect to indirect auto lending, appraisals, escrow accounts and servicing, each of which will entail increased compliance costs. We will continue to monitor these developments and analyze the expected impacts on our business.\nNon-compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, Bank Secrecy Act, or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions and limit our ability to get regulatory approval of acquisitions.\nThe USA PATRIOT and Bank Secrecy Acts require financial institutions to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If such activities are detected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury\u2019s Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions and limit our ability to get regulatory approval of acquisitions. Recently several banking institutions have received large fines for non-compliance with these laws and regulations. While we have developed policies and procedures designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations, no assurance can be given that these policies and procedures will be effective in preventing violations of these laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to potentially significant litigation and our legal related costs might increase.\nThe Company is involved in several litigation matters in the ordinary course of business. In the current economic environment, our involvement in litigation has increased significantly, primarily as a result of defaulted borrowers asserting claims to defeat or delay foreclosure proceedings. These proceedings and the associated legal claims are often contested and the outcome of individual matters is not always predictable. These claims and counter claims typically arise during the course of collection efforts on problem loans or with respect to actions to enforce liens on properties in which the Company holds a security interest. There can be no assurance that loan workouts and other activities will not expose the Company to additional legal actions, including lender liability or environmental claims. Therefore, the Company may be exposed to substantial liabilities, which could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, the expenses of legal proceedings will adversely affect its results of operations until they are resolved. The Company is not a party to any pending legal proceedings that management believes would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to certain risks in connection with our use of technology.\nOur security measures may not be sufficient to mitigate the risk of a cyber attack. Communications and information systems are essential to the conduct of our business, as we use such systems to manage our customer relationships, our general ledger and virtually all other aspects of our business. Our operations rely on the secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. Although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant, the security of our computer systems, software, and networks may be vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses, or other malicious code and cyber attacks that could have a security impact. If one or more of these events occur, this could jeopardize our or our customers' confidential and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or the operations of our customers or counterparties. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us. We could also suffer significant reputational damage.\nSecurity breaches in our internet banking activities could further expose us to possible liability and damage our reputation. Any compromise of our security also could deter customers from using our internet banking services that involve the transmission of confidential information. We rely on standard internet security systems to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data. These precautions may not protect our systems from compromises or breaches of our security measures, and could result in significant legal liability and significant damage to our reputation and our business.\nOur security measures may not protect us from system failures or interruptions. While we have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of systems failures and interruptions, there can be no assurance that such events will not occur or that they will be adequately addressed if they do. In addition, we outsource certain aspects of our data processing and other operational functions to certain third-party providers. If our third-party providers encounter difficulties, or if we have difficulty in communicating with them, our ability to adequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and our business operations could be adversely impacted. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other vendors and their personnel.\nThe occurrence of any failures or interruptions may require us to identify alternative sources of such services, and we cannot assure you that we could negotiate terms that are as favorable to us, or could obtain services with similar functionality as found in our existing systems without the need to expend substantial resources, if at all. Further, the occurrence of any systems failure or interruption could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business, could subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or could expose us to legal liability. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nManaging reputational risk is important to attracting and maintaining customers, investors and employees.\nThreats to our reputation can come from many sources, including adverse sentiment about financial institutions generally, unethical practices, employee misconduct, failure to deliver minimum standards of service or quality, compliance deficiencies, and questionable or fraudulent activities of our customers. We have policies and procedures in place to protect our reputation and promote ethical conduct, but these policies and procedures may not be fully effective. Negative publicity regarding our business, employees, or customers, with or without merit, may result in the loss of customers, investors and employees, costly litigation, a decline in revenues and increased governmental regulation.\nWe may experience future goodwill impairment.\nIn accordance with GAAP, we record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair value, and, as such, acquisitions typically result in recording goodwill. We perform a goodwill evaluation at least annually to test for goodwill impairment. As part of its testing, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company determines the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount using these qualitative factors, the Company then compares the fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount, and then measures impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. Adverse conditions in our business climate, including a significant decline in future operating cash flows, a significant change in our stock price or market capitalization, or a deviation from our expected growth rate and performance may significantly affect the fair value of our goodwill and may trigger additional impairment losses, which could be materially adverse to our operating results and financial position.\nWe cannot provide assurance that we will not be required to take an impairment charge in the future. Any impairment charge has an adverse effect on our results of shareholders\u2019 equity and financial results and could cause a decline in our stock price.\nOur net operating loss carryforwards could be substantially limited if we experience an ownership change as defined in the Internal Revenue Code.\nAs of June 30, 2016 we had approximately $62.1 million of federal net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d). Our ability to use our NOLs and other pre-ownership change losses (collectively, \u201cPre-Change Losses\u201d) to offset future taxable income will be limited if we experience an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time (the \u201cCode\u201d). In general, an ownership change occurs if, among other things, the shareholders (or specified groups of shareholders) who own or have owned, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of a corporation\u2019s common stock or are otherwise treated as 5% shareholders under Section 382 and U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder increase their aggregate percentage ownership of that corporation\u2019s stock by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the stock owned by these shareholders over a rolling three-year period. If we experience an ownership change our Pre-Change Losses will be\nsubject to an annual limitation on their use, which is generally equal to the fair market value of our outstanding stock immediately before the ownership change multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate, which was 2.50% for ownership changes occurring in June 2016. Depending on the size of the annual limitation (which is in part a function of our market capitalization at the time of the ownership change) and the remaining carryforward period for our Pre-Change Losses (U.S. federal net operating losses generally may be carried forward for a period of 20 years), we could realize a permanent loss of some or all of our Pre-Change Losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn September 2012, we adopted a shareholder rights plan (the \u201cRights Plan\u201d), which provides an economic disincentive for any person or group to become an owner, for relevant tax purposes, of 4.99% or more of our stock. While adoption of the Rights Plan should reduce the likelihood that future transactions in our stock will result in an ownership change under Section 382, there can be no assurance that the Rights Plan will be effective to deter a shareholder from increasing its ownership interests beyond the limits set by the Rights Plan or that an ownership change will not occur in the future.", "PERMNO": 13534, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "HTBI"}
