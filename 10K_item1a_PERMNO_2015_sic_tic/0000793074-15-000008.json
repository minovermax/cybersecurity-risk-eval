Caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements made herein because such statements speak only to the date they were made. Unless otherwise required by applicable securities laws, we undertake no obligation or duty to revise or update any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect subsequent events or circumstances or the occurrence of unanticipated events. Also refer to the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in Item 7 of Part II of this Form 10-K.\nOur business is subject to overall economic conditions that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions that impact customer shipping volumes, industry freight demand and industry truck capacity. When shipping volumes decline or available truck capacity increases, freight pricing generally becomes more competitive as carriers compete for loads to maintain truck productivity. We may be negatively affected by future economic conditions including employment levels, business conditions, fuel and energy costs, interest rates and tax rates. Economic conditions may also impact the financial condition of our customers, resulting in a greater risk of bad debt losses, and that of our suppliers, which may affect negotiated pricing or availability of needed goods and services.\nDifficulty in recruiting and retaining experienced drivers, recent driver training school graduates and independent contractors could impact our results of operations and limit growth opportunities.\nAt times, the trucking industry has experienced driver shortages. Driver availability may be affected by changing workforce demographics, alternative employment opportunities (i.e., housing construction and manufacturing industries), national unemployment rates, freight market conditions, availability of financial aid for driver training schools and changing industry regulations. If such a shortage were to occur and additional driver pay rate increases were necessary to attract and retain drivers, our results of operations would be negatively impacted to the extent that we could not obtain corresponding freight rate increases. Additionally, a shortage of drivers could result in idled equipment, which could affect our profitability.\nIndependent contractor availability may also be affected by both inflationary cost increases that are the responsibility of independent contractors and the availability of equipment financing. If a shortage of independent contractors occurs, additional increases in per mile settlement rates (for independent contractors) and driver pay rates (for company drivers) may become necessary to attract and retain a sufficient number of drivers. This could negatively affect our results of operations to the extent that we would be unable to obtain corresponding freight rate increases.\nIncreases in fuel prices and shortages of fuel can have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and profitability.\nTo lessen the effect of fluctuating fuel prices on our margins, we have fuel surcharge programs with our customers. These programs generally enable us to recover a majority, but not all, of the fuel price increases. The remaining portion is generally not recoverable because it results from empty and out-of-route miles (which are not billable to customers) and truck idle time. Fuel prices that change rapidly in short time periods also impact our recovery because the surcharge rate in most programs only changes once per week. Fuel shortages, increases in fuel prices and petroleum product rationing could have a material adverse impact on our operations and profitability. To the extent that we cannot recover the higher cost of fuel through customer fuel surcharges, our financial results would be negatively impacted. As of December 31, 2014, we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry, which may limit growth opportunities and reduce profitability.\nThe freight transportation industry is highly competitive and includes thousands of trucking and non-asset-based logistics companies. We compete primarily with other truckload carriers in our Truckload segment. Logistics companies, intermodal companies, railroads, less-than-truckload carriers and private carriers also provide a lesser degree of competition in our Truckload segment, but such providers are more direct competitors in our VAS segment. Competition for the freight we transport or manage is based primarily on service, efficiency, available capacity and, to some degree, on freight rates alone. This competition could have an adverse effect on either the number of shipments we transport or the freight rates we receive, which could limit our growth opportunities and reduce our profitability.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry. Changes in existing regulations or violations of existing or future regulations could adversely affect our operations and profitability.\nWe are regulated by the DOT in the United States and similar governmental transportation agencies in foreign countries in which we operate. We are also regulated by agencies in certain U.S. states. These regulatory agencies have the authority to govern transportation-related activities, such as safety, authorization to conduct motor carrier operations and other matters. The Regulation subsection in Item 1 of Part I of this Form 10-K describes several proposed and pending regulations that may have a significant effect on our operations including our productivity, driver recruitment and retention and capital expenditures. The subsidiaries of WGL hold a variety of licenses required to carry out its international services, and the loss of any of these licenses could adversely impact the operations of WGL.\nThe seasonal pattern generally experienced in the trucking industry may affect our periodic results during traditionally slower shipping periods and winter months.\nIn the trucking industry, revenues generally follow a seasonal pattern which may affect our results of operations. After the December holiday season and during the remaining winter months, our freight volumes are typically lower because some customers reduce shipment levels. Our operating expenses have historically been higher in the winter months because of cold temperatures and other adverse winter weather conditions which result in decreased fuel efficiency, increased cold weather-related maintenance costs of revenue equipment and increased insurance and claims costs. Revenue can also be affected by adverse weather conditions, holidays and the number of business days during a given period because revenue is directly related to the available working days of shippers.\nWe depend on key customers, the loss or financial failure of which may have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability.\nA significant portion of our revenue is generated from key customers. During 2014, our largest 5, 10 and 25 customers accounted for 25%, 41% and 60% of revenues, respectively. No single customer generated more than 10% of our revenues in 2014, and our largest customer accounted for 6% of our revenues in 2014. We do not have long-term contractual relationships with many of our key One-Way Truckload customers. Our contractual relationships with our Specialized Services customers are typically one to three years in length and may be terminated by either party upon 30 to 90 days\u2019 notice following the expiration of the contract\u2019s first year, and we review rates in these contracts annually. We cannot provide any assurance that key customer relationships will continue at the same levels. If a key customer substantially reduced or terminated our services, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We review our customers\u2019 financial conditions for granting credit, monitor changes in customers\u2019 financial conditions on an ongoing basis, and review individual past-due balances and collection concerns. However, a key customer\u2019s financial failure may negatively affect our results of operations.\nWe depend on the services of third-party capacity providers, the availability of which could affect our profitability and limit growth in our VAS segment.\nOur VAS segment is highly dependent on the services of third-party capacity providers, such as other truckload carriers, less-than-truckload carriers, railroads, ocean carriers and airlines. Many of those providers face the same economic challenges as we do and therefore are actively and competitively soliciting business. These economic conditions may have an adverse effect on the availability and cost of third-party capacity. If we are unable to secure the services of these third-party capacity providers at reasonable rates, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf we cannot effectively manage the challenges associated with doing business internationally, our revenues and profitability may suffer.\nOur results are affected by the success of our operations in Mexico, China and other foreign countries in which we operate. We are subject to risks of doing business internationally, including fluctuations in foreign currencies, changes in the economic strength of the countries in which we do business, difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations and intellectual property rights, burdens of complying with a wide variety of international and United States export and import laws, and social, political, and economic instability. Additional risks associated with our foreign operations, including restrictive trade policies and imposition of duties, taxes, or government royalties by foreign governments, are present but largely mitigated by the terms of NAFTA for Mexico and Canada. The agreement permitting cross border movements for both United States and Mexican based carriers into the United States and Mexico presents additional risks in the form of potential increased competition and the potential for increased congestion on the cross border lanes between countries.\nOur earnings could be reduced by increases in the number of insurance claims, cost per claim, costs of insurance premiums or availability of insurance coverage.\nWe are self-insured for a significant portion of liability resulting from bodily injury, property damage, cargo and associate workers\u2019 compensation and health benefit claims. This is supplemented by premium-based insurance with licensed insurance companies above our self-insurance level for each type of coverage. To the extent we experience a significant increase in the number of claims, cost per claim or insurance premium costs for coverage in excess of our retention amounts, our operating results would be negatively affected. Healthcare legislation and inflationary cost increases could also have a negative effect on our results.\nDecreased demand for our used revenue equipment could result in lower unit sales, resale values and gains on sales of assets.\nWe are sensitive to changes in used equipment prices and demand, especially with respect to tractors. We have been in the business of selling our company-owned trucks since 1992, when we formed our wholly-owned subsidiary Fleet Truck Sales. Reduced demand for used equipment could result in a lower volume of sales or lower sales prices, either of which could negatively affect our gains on sales of assets.\nOur operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties.\nIn addition to direct regulation by DOT, EPA and other federal, state, and local agencies, we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials, aboveground and underground fuel storage tanks, discharge and retention of storm-water, and emissions from our vehicles. We operate in industrial areas, where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination have occurred. Our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage, environmental damage and hazardous waste disposal, among others. We also maintain bulk fuel storage at several of our facilities. If we are involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous\nsubstances, or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. If we fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations, we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability. Tractors and trailers used in our daily operations have been affected by regulatory changes related to air emissions and fuel efficiency, and may be adversely affected in the future by new regulatory actions.\nWe rely on the services of key personnel, the loss of which could impact our future success.\nWe are highly dependent on the services of key personnel, including our executive officers. Although we believe we have an experienced and highly qualified management team, the loss of the services of these key personnel could have a significant adverse impact on us and our future profitability.\nDifficulty in obtaining goods and services from our vendors and suppliers could adversely affect our business.\nWe are dependent on our vendors and suppliers. We believe we have good vendor relationships and that we are generally able to obtain favorable pricing and other terms from vendors and suppliers. If we fail to maintain satisfactory relationships with our vendors and suppliers, or if our vendors and suppliers experience significant financial problems, we could experience difficulty in obtaining needed goods and services because of production interruptions or other reasons. Consequently, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe use our information systems extensively for day-to-day operations, and service disruptions could have an adverse impact on our operations.\nThe efficient operation of our business is highly dependent on our information systems. Much of our software was developed internally or by adapting purchased software applications to suit our needs. Our information systems are used for receiving and planning loads, dispatching drivers and other capacity providers, billing customers and providing financial reports. If any of our critical information systems fail or become unavailable, we would have to perform certain functions manually, which could temporarily affect our ability to efficiently manage our operations. We maintain information security policies to protect our systems and data from cyber security events and threats. We purchased redundant computer hardware systems and have our own off-site disaster recovery facility approximately ten miles from our headquarters for use in the event of a disaster. We took these steps to reduce the risk of disruption to our business operation if a disaster occurred. We believe any such disruption would be minimal or moderate; however, we cannot predict the degree to which any disaster would affect our information systems or disaster recovery facility. Any system failure, disruption, or security breach could interrupt or delay our operations, damage our reputation, cause us to lose customers, or impact our ability to manage our operations, any of which could have an adverse effect on our operations.", "PERMNO": 10397, "SIC": 4213, "TIC": "WERN"}
