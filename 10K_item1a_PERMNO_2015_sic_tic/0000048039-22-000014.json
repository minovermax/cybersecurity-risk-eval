You should carefully consider all information in this Form 10-K, including the Management\u2019s Discussion & Analysis section and the financial statements and related notes, prior to investing in our common stock. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following:\nRisks Related to our Business/Industry:\n\u2022The prices of crude oil and refined and finished lubricant products materially affect our profitability, and are dependent upon many factors that are beyond our control.\n\u2022Our operations are subject to catastrophic losses, operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions and other disruptive risks for which we may not be adequately insured.\n\u2022To successfully operate our facilities, we are required to expend significant amounts for capital outlays and operating expenditures. If we are unable to complete capital projects at their expected costs or in a timely manner, our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\n\u2022The COVID-19 pandemic, actions taken in response thereto, and certain global oil market developments,, have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\u2022Competition in the refining and marketing industry and in our lubricants and specialty products segment is highly competitive, and an increase in competition could adversely affect our earnings and profitability.\n\u2022A disruption to or proration of the refined product distribution systems or manufacturing facilities we utilize could negatively impact our profitability.\n\u2022A material decrease in the supply, or a material increase in the price, of crude oil or other raw materials or equipment available to our refineries and other facilities could significantly reduce our production levels and negatively affect our operations.\n\u2022Terrorist attacks, and the threat of terrorist attacks or vandalism, have resulted in increased costs to our business. Continued global hostilities or other sustained military campaigns may adversely impact our results of operations.\n\u2022Our business may suffer due to a change in the composition of our Board of Directors, or the departure of any of our key senior executives or other key employees. Furthermore, a shortage of skilled labor may make it difficult for us to maintain labor productivity.\n\u2022A portion of our workforce is unionized, and any disruptions in our labor force or adverse employee relations could adversely affect our business.\n\u2022Our business is subject to the risks of international operations, including currency fluctuations.\n\u2022Potential product, service or other related liability claims and litigation could adversely affect our business, reputation and results of operations.\n\u2022We depend upon HEP for a substantial portion of the crude supply and distribution network that serve our refineries, and we own a significant equity interest in HEP.\n\u2022Certain of our facilities and assets are located on or adjacent to Native American tribal lands, which may be subject to access restrictions. Furthermore, our operations are subject to potentially disruptive activity by those concerned with our industry.\n\u2022An impairment of our goodwill or long-lived assets could reduce our earnings or negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022We sell many of our lubricants and specialty products through distributors, which presents risks that could adversely affect our operating results.\n\u2022The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, and the value of a stockholder's investment could be impacted.\nTable of Content\nRisks Related to Our Acquisition Strategy and Recent/Pending Acquisitions\n\u2022Our acquisition strategy involves numerous risks, any of which could adversely affect us.\n\u2022The pending Sinclair Transactions may not be consummated on a timely basis or at all. Failure to complete the acquisition within the expected timeframe or at all could adversely affect our stock price and our future business and financial results.\n\u2022In order to complete the Sinclair Transactions, both we and Sinclair must obtain certain governmental approvals, and if such approvals are not granted with conditions that become applicable to the parties, completion of the transactions may be jeopardized or prevented or the anticipated benefits of the transactions could be reduced.\n\u2022The Sinclair Transactions will require management to devote significant attention and resources to integrating the acquired Sinclair businesses with our business.\n\u2022The actual value of the consideration we will pay to Sinclair at closing may exceed the value allocated to such consideration at the time we entered into the Business Combination Agreement.\n\u2022We will issue a large number of shares New Parent Common Stock in connection with the Sinclair Transactions, which will result in dilution to our existing stockholders and may cause the market price of our common stock to decline in the future as the result of sales of our common stock owned by Sinclair stockholders or current HollyFrontier stockholders. Our stockholders may not realize a benefit from the Sinclair Transactions commensurate with the ownership dilution they will experience.\n\u2022Sinclair will become a significant holder of the combined company\u2019s common stock following completion of the Sinclair Transactions, and as a result, will have the ability to influence our management and affairs.\n\u2022The Sinclair Transactions will expand our branded marketing and licensing business, and we could face a variety of risks as a result of this business expansion.\n\u2022Litigation relating to the Sinclair Transactions could result in substantial costs to HollyFrontier or an injunction preventing the completion of the Sinclair Transactions.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\n\u2022We incur significant costs, and expect to incur additional costs in the future, to comply with existing, new and changing environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, and face potential exposure for environmental matters.\n\u2022There are various risks associated with greenhouse gases and climate change, including increased regulation of CO2 emissions, that could result in increased operating costs and litigation and reduced demand for the refined products we produce and investment in our industry.\n\u2022Physical impacts of climate change could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022The availability and cost of renewable identification numbers and other required credits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022Compliance with and changes in tax laws could materially and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Cybersecurity, Data Security, Information Technology and Intellectual Property\n\u2022Cyberattacks, data security breaches, information technology system failures, network disruptions, terrorist attacks or vandalism, continued global hostilities or other sustained military campaigns could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022Our business is subject to complex and evolving global laws, regulations and security standards regarding privacy, cybersecurity and data protection, which could result in claims, increased cost of operations, or otherwise harm our ability to compete in the market.\n\u2022We may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property, which may increase our cost of doing business or otherwise hurt our ability to compete in the market.\n\u2022If we fail to comply with our obligations under license or technology agreements with third parties or are unable to license rights to use technologies on reasonable terms, we may be required to pay damages or could potentially lose license rights that are critical to our business.\nRisks Related to Liquidity, Financial Instruments and Credit\n\u2022We may not be able to obtain funding on acceptable terms or at all because of volatility and uncertainty in the credit and capital markets. This may hinder or prevent us from meeting our future capital needs.\n\u2022We are exposed to the credit risks, and certain other risks, of our key customers and vendors.\nTable of Content\n\u2022Changes in our credit profile, or a significant increase in the price of crude oil, may affect our relationship with our suppliers, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and limit our ability to purchase sufficient quantities of crude oil to operate our refineries at desired capacity.\n\u2022Our credit facility contains certain covenants and restrictions that may constrain our business and financing activities.\n\u2022Our hedging transactions may limit our gains and expose us to other risks.\n\u2022We have temporarily suspended our quarterly dividends and may be unable to pay future dividends.\nAdditional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business operations. If any of the following risks were to actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. The headings provided in this Item 1A. are for convenience and reference purposes only and shall not affect or limit the extent or interpretation of the risk factors.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS/INDUSTRY\nThe prices of crude oil and refined and finished lubricant products materially affect our profitability, and are dependent upon many factors that are beyond our control, including general market demand and economic conditions, seasonal and weather-related factors, regional and grade differentials and governmental regulations and policies.\nAmong these factors is the demand for crude oil and refined and finished lubricant products, which is largely driven by the conditions of local and worldwide economies, as well as by weather patterns, changes in consumer preferences and the taxation of these products relative to other energy sources. Governmental regulations and policies, particularly in the areas of taxation, energy and the environment, and more recently in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, also have a significant impact on our activities. Operating results can be affected by these industry factors, product and crude pipeline capacities, crude oil differentials (including regional and grade differentials), changes in transportation costs, accidents or interruptions in transportation, competition in the particular geographic areas that we serve, global market conditions, actions by foreign nations and factors that are specific to us, such as the success of particular marketing programs and the efficiency of our refinery operations. The demand for crude oil and refined and finished lubricant products can also be reduced due to a local or national recession or other adverse economic condition, which results in lower spending by businesses and consumers on gasoline and diesel fuel, higher gasoline prices due to higher crude oil prices, a shift by consumers to more fuel-efficient vehicles or alternative fuel vehicles (such as ethanol or wider adoption of gas/electric hybrid vehicles), or an increase in vehicle fuel economy, whether as a result of technological advances by manufacturers, legislation mandating or encouraging higher fuel economy or the use of alternative fuel.\nWe do not produce crude oil and must purchase all our crude oil, the price of which fluctuates based upon worldwide and local market conditions. Our profitability depends largely on the spread between market prices for refined petroleum products and crude oil prices. This margin is continually changing and may fluctuate significantly from time to time. Crude oil and refined products are commodities whose price levels are determined by market forces beyond our control. For example, the reversal of certain existing pipelines or the construction of certain new pipelines transporting additional crude oil or refined products to markets that serve competing refineries could affect the market dynamic that has allowed us to take advantage of favorable pricing. A deterioration of crack spreads or price differentials between domestic and foreign crude oils could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAdditionally, due to the seasonality of refined products markets and refinery maintenance schedules, results of operations for any particular quarter of a fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year and can vary year to year in the event of unseasonably cool weather in the summer months and/or unseasonably warm weather in the winter months in the markets in which we sell our petroleum products. For example, commodity prices for oil and natural gas increased in the first half of 2021, in part due to adverse weather events along the Gulf Coast, including winter storm Uri, that impacted suppliers in those areas. In general, prices for refined products are influenced by the price of crude oil. Although an increase or decrease in the price for crude oil may result in a similar increase or decrease in prices for refined products, there may be a time lag in the realization of the similar increase or decrease in prices for refined products. The effect of changes in crude oil prices on operating results, therefore, depends in part on how quickly refined product prices adjust to reflect these changes. A substantial or prolonged increase in crude oil prices without a corresponding increase in refined product prices, a substantial or prolonged decrease in refined product prices without a corresponding decrease in crude oil prices, or a substantial or prolonged decrease in demand for refined products could have a significant negative effect on our earnings and cash flow. Also, our crude oil and refined products inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market under the last-in, first-out (\u201cLIFO\u201d) inventory valuation methodology. If the market value of our inventory were to decline to an amount less than our LIFO cost, we would record a write-down of inventory and a non-cash charge to cost of products sold even when there is no underlying economic impact at that point in time. Continued volatility in crude oil and refined products prices could result in lower of cost or market inventory charges in the future, or in reversals reducing cost of products sold in subsequent periods should prices recover.\nTable of Content\nOur operations are subject to catastrophic losses, operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions and other disruptive risks for which we may not be adequately insured.\nOur operations are subject to catastrophic losses, operational hazards, unforeseen interruptions and other disruptive risks such as natural disasters, adverse weather, accidents, maritime disasters or casualties (including those involving marine vessels/terminals), fires, explosions, hazardous materials releases or spills, terror or cyberattacks, vandalism, power failures, mechanical failures and other events beyond our control. These events could result in an injury, loss of life, property damage or destruction, as well as a curtailment or an interruption in our operations and may affect our ability to meet customer commitments. In addition, the consequences of any operational incident (including as a result of a maritime disaster or casualty) at our marine terminal facilities may be even more significant as a result of the complexities involved in addressing releases or spills occurring in U.S. federal and/or state waters and/or the repair of marine terminal facilities.\nWe may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at commercially reasonable rates and exclusions from coverage may limit our ability to recover the amount of the full loss in all situations. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies have increased and may continue to increase. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or has become available only for reduced amounts of coverage.\nThere can be no assurance that insurance will cover all or any damages and losses resulting from these types of hazards. We are not fully insured against all risks to our business and therefore, we self-insure certain risks. If any of our facilities were to experience an interruption in operations, our earnings could be materially adversely affected (to the extent not recoverable through insurance) because of lost production and repair costs.\nThe energy industry is highly capital intensive, and the entire or partial loss of individual facilities can result in significant costs to both industry companies, such as us, and their insurance carriers. In recent years, several large energy industry claims have resulted in significant increases in the level of premium costs and deductible periods for participants in the energy industry. As a result of large energy industry claims, insurance companies that have historically participated in underwriting energy-related facilities may discontinue that practice or demand significantly higher premiums or deductible periods to cover these facilities. If significant changes in the number or financial solvency of insurance underwriters for the energy industry occur, or if other adverse conditions over which we have no control prevail in the insurance market, we may be unable to obtain and maintain adequate insurance at reasonable cost. In addition, we cannot assure you that our insurers will renew our insurance coverage on acceptable terms, if at all, or that we will be able to arrange for adequate alternative coverage in the event of non-renewal. Further, our underwriters could have credit issues that affect their ability to pay claims. If a significant accident or event occurs that is self-insured or not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTo successfully operate our facilities, we are required to expend significant amounts for capital outlays and operating expenditures. If we are unable to complete capital projects at their expected costs or in a timely manner, or if the market conditions assumed in our project economics deteriorate, our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur facilities consist of many processing units, a number of which have been in operation for many years. One or more of the units may require unscheduled downtime for unanticipated maintenance or repairs that are more frequent than our scheduled turnaround for such units. Scheduled and unscheduled maintenance could reduce our revenues during the period of time that the units are not operating. We have taken significant measures to expand and upgrade units in our facilities by installing new equipment and redesigning older equipment to improve refinery capacity or to address changes in consumer preferences, such as the growing demand for renewable diesel and other lower carbon fuels. The installation and redesign of key equipment at our facilities, including the construction of the renewable diesel and pre-treatment units at our Artesia facility, involves significant uncertainties, including the following: our upgraded equipment may not perform at expected levels; operating costs of the upgraded equipment may be higher than expected; the yield and product quality of new equipment may differ from design and/or specifications and redesign, modification or replacement of the equipment may be required to correct equipment that does not perform as expected, which could require facility shutdowns until the equipment has been redesigned or modified. Any of these risks associated with new equipment, redesigned older equipment, or repaired equipment could lead to lower revenues or higher costs or otherwise have a negative impact on our future financial condition and results of operations. For example, in the third quarter of 2020, we ceased refining operations at our Cheyenne Refinery due, in part, to uncompetitive operating and maintenance costs for the refinery.\nOne of the ways we may grow our business is through the construction of new refinery processing units (or the purchase and refurbishment of used units from another refinery) and the conversion or expansion of existing ones, such as the conversion of\nTable of Content\nthe Cheyenne Refinery to renewable diesel production and the connection of a new renewable diesel and a pre-treatment unit in Artesia, New Mexico. Projects are generally initiated to increase the yields of higher-value products, increase the amount of lower cost crude oils that can be processed, increase refinery production capacity, meet new governmental requirements or take advantage of new government incentive programs, or maintain the operations of our existing assets. Additionally, our growth strategy includes projects that permit access to new and/or more profitable markets, including the growing demand for renewable diesel and other lower carbon fuels. The construction process involves numerous regulatory, environmental, political, and legal uncertainties, most of which are not fully within our control, including:\n\u2022third party challenges to, denials, or delays with respect to the issuance of requisite regulatory approvals and/or obtaining or renewing permits, licenses, registrations and other authorizations;\n\u2022societal and political pressures and other forms of opposition;\n\u2022compliance with or liability under environmental regulations;\n\u2022unplanned increases in the cost of construction materials or labor;\n\u2022disruptions in transportation of modular components and/or construction materials;\n\u2022severe adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, terror or cyberattacks, vandalism or other events (such as equipment malfunctions, explosions, fires or spills) affecting our facilities, or those of vendors and suppliers;\n\u2022shortages of sufficiently skilled labor, or labor disagreements resulting in unplanned work stoppages;\n\u2022market-related increases in a project's debt or equity financing costs; and/or\n\u2022nonperformance or force majeure by, or disputes with, vendors, suppliers, contractors, or sub-contractors involved with a project.\nIf we are unable to complete capital projects at their expected costs or in a timely manner our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Delays in making required changes or upgrades to our facilities could subject us to fines or penalties as well as affect our ability to supply certain products we make. In addition, our revenues may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project. For instance, the construction of our previously announced renewable diesel unit and pre-treatment unit at our Artesia facility will occur over an extended period of time and we will not receive any material increases in revenues until after completion of the project. Moreover, we may construct facilities to capture anticipated future growth in demand for refined products or renewable diesel in a region in which such growth does not materialize. As a result, new capital investments may not achieve our expected investment return, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, we expect to execute turnarounds at our refineries, which involve numerous risks and uncertainties. These risks include delays and incurrence of additional and unforeseen costs. The turnarounds allow us to perform maintenance, upgrades, overhaul and repair of process equipment and materials, during which time all or a portion of the refinery will be under scheduled downtime.\nOur forecasted internal rates of return are also based upon our projections of future market fundamentals which are not within our control, including changes in general economic conditions, available alternative supply, global market conditions, actions by foreign nations and customer demand.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic or any other widespread outbreak of an illness or pandemic or other public health crisis, and actions taken in response thereto, as well as certain developments in the global oil markets, have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our operations, business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.\nOur success depends on the demand for petroleum products such as transportation fuels and finished lubricant products, which is largely driven by the conditions of local and worldwide economies, and the supply of crude oil and other feedstocks. COVID-19\u2019s spread across the globe and governmental actions in response thereto have negatively affected worldwide economic and commercial activity, significantly impacted global demand for oil, gas and refined products, and created significant volatility and disruption of financial and commodity markets. Other factors currently impacting crude oil supply include production levels implemented by OPEC members, other large oil producers such as Russia and domestic and Canadian oil producers. The oversupply of crude oil in the market has caused certain domestic and Canadian oil producers from whom we source crude oil to shut-in their production, which could impact our ability to readily source crude oil once the stored crude oil is depleted. See \u201cItem 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business\u201d for additional discussion of the impact of COVID-19 on our business.\nIn addition, the supply and demand for refined and finished lubricant products depends on many other factors outside of our control, some of which include:\nTable of Content\n\u2022changes in domestic and international demand for, and the marketability of, our refined and finished lubricant products due to governmental actions, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and shutdowns, which could result in a full or partial shutdown of our facilities;\n\u2022increased price volatility, including the price we receive for refined and finished lubricant products;\n\u2022the health of our workforce, including contractors and subcontractors, and their access to our facilities, which could result in a full or partial shutdown of our facilities if a significant portion of the workforce at a facility is impacted;\n\u2022the availability, distribution and effectiveness of vaccines for COVID-19;\n\u2022the ability or willingness of our vendors and suppliers to provide the equipment, parts, crude oil or other raw materials for our operations or otherwise fulfill their contractual obligations, which could reduce our production levels or otherwise cause our delay or failure to deliver refined or other finished lubricant products timely or at all or cause delay or failure to complete projects at our facilities;\n\u2022the ability or willingness of our customers to fulfill their contractual obligations or any material reduction in, or loss of, revenue from our customers;\n\u2022increased potential for the occurrence of operational hazards, including terrorism, cyberattacks or domestic vandalism, as well as information system failures or communication network disruptions;\n\u2022increased cost and reduced availability of capital for growth or capital expenditures;\n\u2022availability and operability of terminals, tankage and pipelines that store and transport crude oil and refined and finished lubricant products;\n\u2022delay by government authorities in issuing or maintaining permits necessary for our business or our capital projects;\n\u2022shareholder activism and activities by non-governmental organizations to limit sources of funding for the energy sector;\n\u2022increased costs of operation in relation to the COVID-19 outbreak, which costs may not be fully recoverable or adequately covered by insurance; and\n\u2022the impact of any economic downturn, recession or other disruption of the U.S. and global economies and financial and commodity markets.\nAdverse developments in the global economy or in regional economies could also negatively impact our customers and suppliers, and therefore have a negative impact on our business or financial condition. In the event of adverse developments or stagnation in the economy or financial markets, our customers may experience deterioration of their businesses, reduced demand for their products, cash flow shortages and difficulty obtaining financing. As a result, existing or potential customers might delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us in a timely fashion. Further, suppliers may experience similar conditions, which could impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to us.\nThe spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices (including limiting employee and contractor presence at our work locations, restricting travel unless approved by senior leadership, quarantining employees when necessary, reducing our expected total consolidated capital expenditures for 2021 and reducing utilization at our refineries from time to time as needed), and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, contractors, customers, suppliers and communities. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus, and our ability to perform critical functions could be adversely impacted. In addition, deterioration in gross margins and the economic slowdown resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic was a contributing factor in certain goodwill and long-lived asset impairments we recorded in 2020. See \u201cAn impairment of our goodwill or long-lived assets could reduce our earnings or negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations\u201d for further discussion of the impairment risk in our business and the impairments we recorded in 2020. A reasonable expectation exists that further deterioration in gross margins or a prolonged economic slowdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic could result in an additional impairment of assets or of goodwill at some point in the future. Such impairment charges could be material.\nThe effects of COVID-19 are difficult to predict and the duration of any potential business disruption or the extent to which it may negatively affect our operating results is uncertain. The extent to which the pandemic will continue to impact our business results and operations remains uncertain in light of the rapidly evolving environment, duration and severity of the spread of the virus, emerging variants, vaccine and booster effectiveness, public acceptance of safety protocols, and government measures, including vaccine mandates, designed to slow and contain the spread of COVID-19, among others, and all of which are beyond our control. In addition, if the volatility and seasonality in the oil and gas industry were to increase, the demand for our products and the prices that we will be able to charge for those products may decline. We continue to monitor the situation to assess further possible implications to our business and to take actions in an effort to mitigate adverse consequences. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the volatility in global oil markets, while uncertain, have and may continue to, materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows, as well as our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nTable of Content\nCompetition in the refining and marketing industry is intense, and an increase in competition in the markets in which we sell our products could adversely affect our earnings and profitability.\nWe compete with a broad range of refining and marketing companies, including certain multinational oil companies. Because of their geographic diversity, larger and more complex refineries, integrated operations and greater resources, some of our competitors may be better able to withstand volatile market conditions, to obtain crude oil in times of shortage and to bear the economic risks inherent in all areas of the refining industry.\nWe are not engaged in petroleum exploration and production activities and do not produce any of the crude oil feedstocks used at our refineries. We do not have a retail business and therefore are dependent upon others for outlets for our refined products. Certain of our competitors, however, obtain a portion of their feedstocks from company-owned production and have retail outlets. Competitors that have their own production or extensive retail outlets, with brand-name recognition, are at times able to offset losses from refining operations with profits from producing or retailing operations, and may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refining margins or feedstock shortages.\nIn recent years there have been several refining and marketing consolidations or acquisitions between entities competing in our geographic market. These transactions could increase the future competitive pressures on us.\nThe markets in which we compete may be impacted by competitors' plans for expansion projects and refinery improvements that could increase the production of refined products in our areas of operation and significantly affect our profitability.\nAlso, the potential operation of new or expanded refined product transportation pipelines, or the conversion of existing pipelines into refined product transportation pipelines, could impact the supply of refined products to our existing markets and negatively affect our profitability.\nIn addition, we compete with other industries that provide alternative means to satisfy the energy and fuel requirements of our industrial, commercial and individual consumers. The more successful these alternatives become as a result of governmental regulations, technological advances, consumer demand, improved pricing or otherwise, the greater the impact on pricing and demand for our products and our profitability. There are presently significant governmental and consumer pressures to increase the use of alternative fuels in the United States.\nThe market for our lubricants and specialty products segment is highly competitive and requires us to continuously develop and introduce new products and product enhancements.\nOur ability to grow our Lubricants and Specialty Products segment depends, in part, on our ability to continuously develop, manufacture and introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely and cost-effective basis, in response to customers\u2019 demands for higher performance process lubricants, coatings, greases and other product offerings. Our competitors may develop new products or enhancements to their products that offer performance, features and lower prices that may render our products less competitive or obsolete, and, as a consequence, we may lose business and/or significant market share. Our efforts to respond to changes in consumer demand in a timely and cost-efficient manner to drive growth could be adversely affected by unfavorable margins or difficulties or delays in product development and service innovation, including the inability to identify viable new products, successfully complete research and development, obtain regulatory approvals, obtain intellectual property protection or gain market acceptance of new products or service techniques. The development and commercialization of new products require significant expenditures over an extended period of time, and some products that we seek to develop may never become profitable, and we could be required to write-off our investments related to a new product that does not reach commercial viability.\nA disruption to or proration of the refined product distribution systems or manufacturing facilities we utilize could negatively impact our profitability.\nWe utilize various common carrier or other third party pipeline systems to deliver our products to market. The key systems utilized by the El Dorado, Navajo, Puget Sound, Woods Cross, and Tulsa Refineries are NuStar Energy and Magellan, SFPP, Olympic and Plains, Chevron and UNEV, and Magellan, respectively.\nOur U.S. refineries also utilize systems owned by HEP. If these key pipelines or their associated tanks and terminals become inoperative or decrease the capacity available to us, we may not be able to sell our product, or we may be required to hold our product in inventory or supply products to our customers through an alternative pipeline or by rail or additional tanker trucks from the refinery, all of which could increase our costs and result in a decline in profitability.\nTable of Content\nWe have manufacturing facilities in foreign countries that support the Lubricants and Specialty Products segment. If one of our facilities is damaged or disrupted, resulting in production being halted for an extended period, we may not be able to timely supply our customers. We take steps to mitigate this risk, including business continuity and contingency planning and procuring property insurance (including resulting business interruption) and casualty insurance. Nevertheless, the loss of sales in any one region over an extended period of time could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA material decrease in the supply, or a material increase in the price, of crude oil or other raw materials or equipment available to our refineries and other facilities could significantly reduce our production levels and negatively affect our operations.\nTo maintain or increase production levels at our refineries, we must continually contract for crude oil supplies from third parties. There are a limited number of crude oil suppliers in certain geographic regions, and in such cases, we may be required to source from a single third party supplier. If we are unable to maintain or extend our existing contracts with any such crude oil suppliers, or enter into new agreements on similar terms, the supply of crude oil could be adversely impacted, or we may incur a higher cost. A material decrease in crude oil production from the fields that supply our refineries, as a result of depressed commodity prices, decreased demand, lack of drilling activity, natural production declines, catastrophic events or otherwise, could result in a decline in the volume of crude oil available to our refineries. In addition, any prolonged disruption of a significant pipeline that is used in supplying crude oil to our refineries or the potential operation of a new, converted or expanded crude oil pipeline that transports crude oil to other markets could result in a decline in the volume of crude oil available to our refineries. Such an event could result in an overall decline in volumes of refined products processed at our refineries and therefore a corresponding reduction in our cash flow. In addition, the future growth of our operations will depend in part upon whether we can contract for additional supplies of crude oil at a greater rate than the rate of natural decline in our currently connected supplies. If we are unable to secure additional crude oil supplies of sufficient quality or crude pipeline expansion to our refineries, we will be unable to take full advantage of current and future expansion of our refineries' production capacities.\nFor certain raw materials and utilities used by our refineries and other facilities, there are a limited number of suppliers and, in some cases, we source from a single supplier and/or suppliers in economies that have experienced instability or the supplies are specific to the particular geographic region in which a facility is located. Any significant disruption in supply could affect our ability to obtain raw materials, or increase the cost of such raw materials, which could significantly reduce our production levels or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, certain raw materials that we use are subject to various regulatory laws, and a change in the ability to legally use such raw materials may impact our liquidity, financial position and results of operations.\nIt is also common in the refining industry for a facility to have a sole, dedicated source for its utilities, such as steam, electricity, water and gas. Having a sole or limited number of suppliers may limit our negotiating power, particularly in the case of rising raw material costs. Any new supply agreements we enter into may not have terms as favorable as those contained in our current supply agreements. Additionally, there is growing concern over the reliability of water sources. The decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of population growth, drought or regulation could negatively impact our operations.\nIn addition, periods of disruption in the global supply chain, including as a result of COVID-19, have caused shortages in the equipment and parts necessary to operate our facilities and complete our capital projects. Certain suppliers have experienced, and may continue to experience, delays related to a variety of factors, including logistical delays and component shortages from vendors. We continue to monitor the situation and work closely with our suppliers to minimize disruption to our operations as a result of supply chain interruptions.\nIf our raw material, utility or water supplies or access to the equipment necessary to operate our facilities were disrupted, our businesses may incur increased costs to procure alternative supplies or equipment or incur excessive downtime, which would have a direct negative impact on our operations.\nTerrorist attacks, and the threat of terrorist attacks or vandalism, have resulted in increased costs to our business. Continued global hostilities or other sustained military campaigns may adversely impact our results of operations.\nThe long-term impacts of terrorist attacks and the threat of future terrorist attacks on the energy transportation industry in general, and on us in particular, are unknown. Any attack on our facilities or those of our customers or suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business. Increased security measures taken by us as a precaution against possible terrorist attacks or domestic vandalism have resulted in increased costs to our business. Uncertainty surrounding continued global hostilities or other sustained military campaigns, and the possibility that infrastructure facilities could be direct targets of, or\nTable of Content\nindirect casualties of, an act of terror, may affect our operations in unpredictable ways, including disruptions of crude oil supplies and markets for refined products. In addition, disruption or significant increases in energy prices could result in government-imposed price controls. Any one of, or a combination of, these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in the insurance markets attributable to terrorist attacks, vandalism, or cyberattacks or extortion could make certain types of insurance more difficult for us to obtain. Moreover, the insurance that may be available to us may be significantly more expensive than our existing insurance coverage. Instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism, cyberattacks, vandalism or war could also affect our ability to raise capital including our ability to repay or refinance debt.\nOur business may suffer due to a change in the composition of our Board of Directors, or the departure of any of our key senior executives or other key employees. Furthermore, a shortage of skilled labor may make it difficult for us to maintain labor productivity.\nOur future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our Board of Directors, our senior management team and key technical personnel. We do not currently maintain key person life insurance, non-compete agreements, or employment agreements with respect to any member of our senior management team. The loss or unavailability to us of any member of our senior management team or a key technical employee could significantly harm us. We face competition for these professionals from our competitors, our customers and other companies operating in our industry. To the extent that the services of members of our senior management team and key technical personnel would be unavailable to us for any reason, we may be required to hire other personnel to manage and operate our company. We may not be able to locate or employ such qualified personnel on acceptable terms, or at all.\nFurthermore, our operations require skilled and experienced laborers with proficiency in multiple tasks. A shortage of trained workers due to retirements or otherwise could have an adverse impact on productivity and costs and our ability to expand production in the event there is an increase in the demand for our products and services, which could adversely affect our operations.\nA portion of our workforce is unionized, and any disruptions in our labor force or adverse employee relations could adversely affect our business.\nWe depend on unionized labor for the operation of many of our facilities. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 32% of our employees were represented by labor unions under collective bargaining agreements with various expiration dates. In addition, employees who are not currently represented by labor unions may seek union representation in the future. We may not be able to renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements when they expire on satisfactory terms or at all. If we are unable to renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements when they expire, any work stoppages or other labor disturbances at these facilities could have an adverse effect on our business, impact our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders and payments of our debt obligations, and increase our costs. In addition, our existing labor agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage or other adverse employee relations event at any of our facilities in the future, and any work stoppage could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to the risks of international operations, including currency fluctuations\nWe derive a portion of our revenue and earnings from international operations. Our acquisitions of Petro-Canada Lubricants and Sonneborn have expanded our operations and sales in foreign countries and correspondingly may increase our exposure to foreign exchange risks. Any significant change in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do business against the U.S. dollar could affect our revenue, competitiveness and cost of doing business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, compliance with applicable U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, such as import and export requirements, anti-corruption laws, data privacy regulations and foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, environmental laws, labor laws and anti-competition regulations, increases the cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. Although we have implemented policies and procedures to comply with these laws and regulations, a violation by any of our employees, contractors, distributors or agents could nevertheless occur. In some cases, compliance with the laws and regulations of one country could violate the laws and regulations of another country. Violations of these laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our company's brand, international growth efforts and business.\nTable of Content\nIn addition, global market risks, actions by foreign nations and other international conditions, particularly in a time of increasing economic and global instability, may have a material adverse effect on our results and operations. The consequences of such uncertainty cannot be anticipated or quantified.\nPotential product, service or other related liability claims and litigation could adversely affect our business, reputation and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our operating responsibility on refined product pipelines is to maintain the quality and purity of the products loaded at our loading racks. If our quality control measures were to fail, we may have contaminated or off-specification commingled pipelines and storage tanks or off-specification product could be sent to public gasoline stations. The development, manufacture and sale of specialty lubricant products also involves an inherent risk of exposure to potential product liability claims. These types of incidents could result in product liability claims from our customers. Our Lubricants and Specialty Products segment could also be subject to false advertising claims, product recalls, workplace exposure, product seizures and related adverse publicity.\nAny of these incidents is a significant commercial risk. Substantial damage awards have been made in certain jurisdictions against manufacturers and resellers based upon claims for injuries caused by the use of or exposure to various products. There can be no assurance that product liability claims against us would not have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation or results of operations or our ability to maintain existing customers or retain new customers. Although we maintain product and other general liability insurance, there can be no assurance that the types or levels of coverage maintained are adequate to cover these potential risks, or that we will be able to continue to maintain existing insurance or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost, if at all.\nWe depend upon HEP for a substantial portion of the crude supply and distribution network that serve our refineries, and we own a significant equity interest in HEP.\nAt December 31, 2021, we owned a 57% limited partner interest and a non-economic general partner interest in HEP. HEP operates a system of crude oil and petroleum product pipelines, distribution terminals and refinery tankage in Idaho, Kansas, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wyoming and refinery units in Kansas and Utah. HEP generates revenues by charging tariffs for transporting petroleum products and crude oil through its pipelines, leasing certain pipeline capacity to third parties, charging fees for terminalling refined products and other hydrocarbons and storing and providing other services at its terminals. HEP serves the El Dorado, Navajo, Woods Cross and Tulsa Refineries under several long-term pipeline and terminal, tankage and throughput agreements expiring in 2022 through 2036 serves the El Dorado Refinery under long-term tolling agreements expiring in 2030 and serves the Woods Cross Refinery under long-term tolling agreements expiring in 2031. Furthermore, our financial statements include the consolidated results of HEP. HEP is subject to its own operating and regulatory risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022its reliance on its significant customers, including us;\n\u2022competition from other pipelines;\n\u2022environmental regulations affecting pipeline operations;\n\u2022operational hazards and risks;\n\u2022pipeline tariff regulations affecting the rates HEP can charge;\n\u2022limitations on additional borrowings and other restrictions due to HEP's debt covenants; and\n\u2022other financial, operational and legal risks.\nThe occurrence of any of these risks could directly or indirectly affect HEP's as well as our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as HEP is a consolidated VIE. Additionally, these risks could affect HEP's ability to continue operations which could affect their ability to serve our supply and distribution network needs.\nWhile we own a 57% limited partner interest and a non-economic general partner interest in HEP, HEP is a publicly-traded master limited partnership and is a legally distinct entity. Conflicts of interest may arise between us and HEP, which may subject us to claims from HEP's public unitholders.\nFor additional information about HEP, see \u201cHolly Energy Partners, L.P.\u201d under Items 1 and 2, \u201cBusiness and Properties.\u201d For risks related to HEP's business, see Item 1A of HEP's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021.\nCertain of our facilities and assets are located on or adjacent to Native American tribal lands. Furthermore, our operations are subject to potentially disruptive activity by those concerned with our industry.\nTable of Content\nCertain of our facilities and other assets are located on or adjacent to Native American tribal lands. Various federal agencies, along with each Native American tribe, promulgate and enforce regulations, including environmental standards, regarding operations on Native American tribal lands. In addition, each Native American tribe is a sovereign nation having the right to enforce laws and regulations (including various taxes, fees, and other requirements and conditions) and to grant approvals independent from federal, state and local statutes and regulations. In 2020, the Supreme Court ruled in McGirt v. Oklahoma that the Muscogee (Creek) Nation reservation in Eastern Oklahoma has not been disestablished, and several state courts have subsequently used the analysis therein to find that other reservations in the state have not been disestablished. Although the ruling in McGirt indicates that it is limited to criminal law, the ruling has significant potential implications for civil law. At this time, we cannot predict how these jurisdictional issues may ultimately be resolved. Furthermore, our operations may be disrupted by restrictions on our access to railways and waterways on or adjacent to tribal lands, including, for example, through restrictions on the number of trains permitted to cross certain reservations. These factors may increase our cost of doing business on Native American tribal lands.\nIn addition, our industry is subject to potentially disruptive activities by those concerned with the possible environmental impacts of crude oil and refined products. Activists, non-governmental organizations and others may seek to restrict our operations or the transportation of crude oil and refined products by exerting social or political pressure. This interference could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations\nAn impairment of our goodwill or long-lived assets could reduce our earnings or negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nAn impairment of our goodwill or long-lived assets could reduce our earnings or negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. We continually monitor our business, the business environment and the performance of our operations to determine if an event has occurred that indicates that a goodwill or long-lived asset may be impaired. If a triggering event occurs, which is a determination that involves judgment, we may be required to utilize cash flow projections to assess our ability to recover the carrying value based on the ability to generate future cash flows. We may also conduct impairment testing based on both the guideline public company and guideline transaction methods. Our goodwill and long-lived assets impairment analyses are sensitive to changes in key assumptions used in our analysis, estimates of future crack spreads, forecasted production levels, operating costs and capital expenditures. If the assumptions used in our analysis are not realized, it is possible a material impairment charge may need to be recorded in the future. We cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any additional impairments of goodwill or long-lived assets in the future.\nAs market prices for refined products and market prices for crude oil continue to fluctuate, we will need to continue to evaluate the carrying value of our refinery reporting units. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded long-lived asset impairment charges of $232.2 million that related to our Cheyenne Refinery, $26.5 million for construction-in-progress consisting primarily of engineering work for potential upgrades to certain processing units at our Tulsa and El Dorado Refineries and $204.7 million related to PCLI. Also, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $81.9 million that related to Sonneborn. A reasonable expectation exists that further deterioration in our operating results or overall economic conditions could result in an impairment of goodwill and / or additional long-lived asset impairments at some point in the future. Future impairment charges could be material to our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe sell many of our lubricants and specialty products through distributors, which presents risks that could adversely affect our operating results.\nA large portion of our lubricants and specialty product sales, both in domestic and international markets, occur through distributors. As a result, we are dependent on these distributors to promote and create demand for our products. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in maintaining and strengthening our relationships with our distributors or establishing relationships with new distributors who have the ability to market, sell and support our products effectively. We may rely on one or more key distributors for a product or a region, and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue. The sales, business practices and reputation of our distributors may affect our business and our reputation. The consolidation of distributors, loss of a relationship with a distributor, significant disagreement with a distributor, or significant deterioration in the financial condition of a distributor could also have an adverse effect on our operating results and may also result in increased competition in the applicable jurisdiction.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, and the value of a stockholder\u2019s investment could be impacted.\nTable of Content\nThe market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022our quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022general economic, industry global and stock market conditions;\n\u2022the failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock or changes in financial estimates by analysts;\n\u2022future sales of our common stock;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts or acquisitions;\n\u2022sales of common stock by us, our senior officers or our affiliates; and/or\n\u2022the other factors described in these Risk Factors.\nIn recent years, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies, including companies in our industry. The price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company, and these fluctuations could materially reduce our stock price.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR ACQUISITION STRATEGY AND RECENT/PENDING ACQUISITIONS\nOur acquisition strategy involves numerous risks, any of which could adversely affect us.\nAn additional component of our growth strategy is to selectively acquire complementary assets or businesses for our refining operations, such as our recent acquisition of the Puget Sound Refinery, in order to increase earnings and cash flow. Our ability to do so will be dependent upon a number of factors, including our ability to identify attractive acquisition candidates, consummate acquisitions on favorable terms, successfully integrate acquired assets and obtain financing to fund acquisitions and to support our growth, and other factors beyond our control. Risks associated with acquisitions include those relating to:\n\u2022diversion of management time and attention from our existing business;\n\u2022challenges in managing the increased scope, geographic diversity and complexity of operations and inefficiencies that may result therefrom;\n\u2022difficulties in integrating the financial, technological and management standards, processes, procedures and controls of an acquired business with those of our existing operations;\n\u2022liability for known or unknown environmental conditions or other contingent liabilities not covered by indemnification or insurance;\n\u2022greater than anticipated expenditures required for compliance with environmental or other regulatory standards or for investments to improve operating results;\n\u2022difficulties or delays in achieving anticipated operational improvements or benefits or inaccurate assumptions about future synergies or revenues;\n\u2022incurrence of additional indebtedness to finance acquisitions or capital expenditures relating to acquired assets; and\n\u2022issuance of additional equity, which could result in further dilution of the ownership interest of existing stockholders.\nAny acquisitions that we do consummate may have adverse effects on our business and operating results.\nThe pending Sinclair Transactions may not be consummated on a timely basis or at all. Failure to complete the acquisition within the expected timeframe or at all could adversely affect our stock price and our future business and financial results.\nOn August 2, 2021, we entered into the Business Combination Agreement with Sinclair and certain other parties thereto in connection with the Sinclair Transactions and HEP entered into the Contribution Agreement with Sinclair and certain other parties thereto in connection with the Sinclair Transactions. The transactions under the Contribution Agreement will be consummated immediately prior to the transactions contemplated under the Business Combination Agreement. We expect the Sinclair Transactions to close in 2022. The Sinclair Transactions are subject to closing conditions. If these conditions are not satisfied or waived, the Sinclair Transactions will not be consummated. If the closing of the Sinclair Transactions is substantially delayed or does not occur at all, or if the terms of the Sinclair Transactions are required to be modified substantially, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the transactions fully or at all or they may take longer to realize than expected. The closing conditions include, among others, the absence of a law or order prohibiting the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement and the termination or expiration of any waiting periods under the Hart-Scott Rodino Act, as amended (the \u201cHSR Act\u201d), with respect to the Sinclair Transactions. On August 23, 2021, each of HollyFrontier and Sinclair filed its respective premerger notification and report regarding the Sinclair Transactions with the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d) under the HSR Act. On September 22, 2021, we and Sinclair each\nTable of Content\nreceived a request for additional information and documentary material (\u201cSecond Request\u201d) from the FTC in connection with the FTC\u2019s review of the Sinclair Transactions. Issuance of the Second Request extends the waiting period under the HSR Act until 30 days after both we and Sinclair have substantially complied with the Second Request, unless the waiting period is terminated earlier by the FTC or the parties otherwise commit not to close the Sinclair Transactions for some additional period of time. HollyFrontier and Sinclair are cooperating with the FTC staff in its review and are working diligently to satisfy the closing conditions as soon as possible. We have incurred and will continue to incur substantial transaction costs whether or not the Sinclair Transactions are completed. Any failure to complete the Sinclair Transactions could have a material adverse effect on our stock price, our competitiveness and reputation in the marketplace, and our future business and financial results, including our ability to execute on our strategy to return capital to our stockholders.\nIn order to complete the Sinclair Transactions, HollyFrontier and Sinclair must obtain certain governmental approvals, and if such approvals are not granted or are granted with conditions that become applicable to the parties, completion of the transactions may be jeopardized or prevented or the anticipated benefits of the transactions could be reduced.\nCompletion of the Sinclair Transactions is conditioned upon the expiration or termination of the waiting period relating to the Sinclair Transactions under the HSR Act. Although HollyFrontier, HEP and Sinclair have agreed in the Business Combination Agreement and Contribution Agreement to use their reasonable best efforts, subject to certain limitations, to make the necessary filings under the HSR Act and obtain the required governmental approvals, there can be no assurance that the relevant waiting period will expire or terminate and no assurance that the transactions will be completed. In addition, the FTC has broad discretion in administering the governing laws and regulations, and may take into account various facts and circumstances in their consideration of the Sinclair Transactions, including other potential transactions in the oil and gas industry or other industries. The FTC may be affected by government shutdowns, which could result in delays regarding any potential approvals or other actions. The FTC may initiate proceedings seeking to prevent, or otherwise seek to prevent, the transactions. As a condition to the approval of the Sinclair Transactions, the FTC may also impose requirements, limitations or costs, require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of the parties\u2019 business after completion of the transactions. Under the terms of the Business Combination Agreement and Contribution Agreement, HollyFrontier and HEP are obligated to use reasonable best efforts to complete the transactions, but are not required to take any actions or agree to any terms or conditions in connection with obtaining any regulatory approvals for completing the transactions beyond those specifically described in the Business Combination Agreement and Contribution Agreement.\nIn the Contribution Agreement, HEP and Sinclair agreed that the consideration to be paid by HEP to Sinclair in connection with the HEP Transaction would be adjusted downward if, as a condition to obtaining antitrust clearance for the Sinclair Transactions, the FTC requires HEP to divest a portion of its equity interest in UNEV and the sales price for such interests does not exceed the threshold provided in the Contribution Agreement. In the Business Combination Agreement, HollyFrontier and Sinclair agreed that the stock consideration to be issued to Sinclair would be reduced if, as a condition to obtaining antitrust clearance for the Sinclair Transactions, the FTC requires HollyFrontier to divest its Woods Cross Refinery and certain related assets and the sales price for such assets does not exceed a threshold provided in the Business Combination Agreement. In addition, HollyFrontier and HEP entered into a Letter Agreement (\u201cLetter Agreement\u201d), which provides that if, as a condition to obtaining antitrust clearance for the Sinclair Transactions, HollyFrontier enters into a definitive agreement to divest the Woods Cross Refinery, then HEP would sell certain assets located at, or relating to, the Woods Cross Refinery to HollyFrontier in exchange for cash consideration equal to $232.5 million plus the certain accounts receivable of HEP in respect of such assets, with such sale to be effective immediately prior to the closing of the sale of the Woods Cross Refinery by HollyFrontier. The Letter Agreement also provides that HEP\u2019s right to future revenues from HollyFrontier in respect of such Woods Cross Refinery assets will terminate at the closing of such sale. If as a condition to the approval of the Sinclair Transactions the FTC requires HollyFrontier and HEP to divest the assets specified in the Business Combination Agreement, Contribution Agreement and Letter Agreement, the cash flows relating to the divested assets would also be lost, the anticipated benefits of the Sinclair Transactions would be reduced and the combined company\u2019s business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nHowever, notwithstanding the provisions of the Business Combination Agreement and Contribution Agreement, HollyFrontier, HEP or Sinclair could agree to become subject to terms or conditions beyond those required in the Business Combination Agreement and Contribution Agreement in connection with the expiration or termination of such waiting period, the imposition of which could adversely affect HollyFrontier\u2019s and HEP\u2019s ability to integrate Sinclair\u2019s operations with their operations, reduce the anticipated benefits of the transactions or otherwise materially and adversely affect the combined company\u2019s business cash flows and results of operations after completion of the transactions.\nTable of Content\nThe Sinclair Transactions will require management to devote significant attention and resources to integrating the acquired Sinclair businesses with our business.\nThe Sinclair Transactions will require management to devote significant attention and resources to integrating the acquired Sinclair businesses with our business. Potential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include, among others:\n\u2022 the inability to successfully integrate the acquired Sinclair business into the HollyFrontier business in a manner that permits us to achieve the revenue and cost savings that we announced as anticipated from the Sinclair Transactions, including approximately $100 million in run-rate synergies that we have communicated we expect the combined company to realize, as well as another $100 to $200 million in estimated one-time savings from working capital benefits during the first two years after closing of the Sinclair Transactions, as previously announced;\n\u2022 the inability to integrate multiple acquisitions simultaneously or within a short timeframe of each other, including the Sinclair Transactions and the acquisition of the Puget Sound Refinery;\n\u2022 complexities associated with managing the larger, integrated business;\n\u2022 potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with the Sinclair Transactions;\n\u2022 integrating personnel from the two companies while maintaining focus on providing consistent, high-quality products and services;\n\u2022 loss of key employees;\n\u2022 integrating relationships with customers, vendors and business partners;\n\u2022 performance shortfalls at one or both of the companies as a result of the diversion of management\u2019s attention caused by completing the Sinclair Transactions and integrating acquired Sinclair operations into HollyFrontier; or\n\u2022 the disruption of, or loss of momentum in, each company\u2019s ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies.\nDelays or difficulties in the integration process could adversely affect our business, financial results, financial condition and stock price. Even if we are able to integrate our business operations successfully, there can be no assurance that this integration will result in the realization of the full benefits of synergies, cost savings, innovation and operational efficiencies that we currently expect or have communicated from this integration or that these benefits will be achieved within the anticipated time frame.\nThe actual value of the consideration we will pay to Sinclair at closing may exceed the value allocated to such consideration at the time we entered into the Business Combination Agreement.\nUnder the Business Combination Agreement, the number of shares of common stock we will issue to Sinclair at the closing of the Sinclair Transactions is fixed at 60,230,036, which represents approximately 26.75% of HollyFrontier\u2019s outstanding common stock as of July 30, 2021, and there will be no adjustment for changes in the market price of our common stock. Neither we nor the Sinclair stockholders are permitted to \u201cwalk away\u201d from the transaction solely because of changes in the market price of our common stock between the signing of the Business Combination Agreement and the closing. Our common stock has historically experienced volatility. Stock price changes may result from a variety of factors that are beyond our control, including changes in our business, operations and prospects, regulatory considerations and general market and economic conditions. The closing price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on July 30, 2021, was $29.40; and on February 18, 2022, the closing price of our common stock was $35.43. The value of the common stock we issue in connection with the closing of the Sinclair Transactions may be significantly higher at the closing than when we entered into the Business Combination Agreement.\nWe will issue a large number of shares of New Parent Common Stock in connection with the Sinclair Transactions, which will result in dilution to our existing stockholders and may cause the market price of our common stock to decline in the future as the result of sales of our common stock owned by Sinclair stockholders or current HollyFrontier stockholders. Our stockholders may not realize a benefit from the Sinclair Transactions commensurate with the ownership dilution they will experience.\nAt the closing of the Sinclair Transactions, we will issue 60,230,036 shares of New Parent Common Stock, which represents 26.75% of the outstanding shares of our common stock on an adjusted basis as of July 30, 2021. The issuance of the such shares of common stock will result in dilution of our existing stockholders\u2019 ownership interests and may also have an adverse impact on net income per share in fiscal periods that include (or follow) the closing.\nTable of Content\nThe Stockholders Agreement (the \u201cStockholders Agreement\u201d) by and among New Parent, Sinclair and the stockholders of Sinclair (the \u201cSinclair Parties\u201d) subjects 45,172,527 of the shares of New Parent Common Stock issued to the Sinclair Parties (\u201cRestricted Shares\u201d) to a \u201clock-up\u201d period commencing on the closing date, with one-third of such Restricted Shares being released from such restrictions on the date that is six months after the closing, one-third of the Restricted Shares being released from such restrictions on the first anniversary of the closing date, and the remainder being released from such restrictions on the date that is 15 months from the closing date. In addition, until the earliest to occur of (i) the date on which the Sinclair Parties beneficially own New Parent Common Stock constituting less than 5% of all outstanding New Parent Common Stock and (ii) the date on which a Change of Control (as defined in the Stockholders Agreement) occurs, the Sinclair Parties will be prohibited from transferring the shares of New Parent Common Stock owned by them to certain prohibited transferees, subject to certain permitted exceptions.\nFurther, New Parent has agreed to file, within five business days following the closing date, a shelf registration statement under the Securities Act, to permit the public resale of all the registrable securities held by the Sinclair Parties once the Restricted Shares are no longer subject to a lock-up.\nIn addition, following their receipt of shares of New Parent Common Stock as stock consideration in the Sinclair Transactions, subject to release from the associated lock-up provisions and the filing of a resale registration statement or satisfaction of the requirements of Rule 144, the Sinclair Parties may seek to sell the shares of New Parent Common Stock delivered to them. HollyFrontier stockholders may also seek to sell shares held by them of our common stock held in anticipation of completion of the closing, or of New Parent Common Stock following the closing. These sales (or the perception that these sales may occur), coupled with the increase in the outstanding number of shares of New Parent Common Stock, may affect the market for, and the market price of, our common stock and New Parent Common Stock in an adverse manner.\nIf we are unable to realize the strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated from the Sinclair Transactions, our stockholders will have experienced dilution of their ownership interest without receiving commensurate benefit, and we may be unable to execute on our strategy to return capital to our stockholders that was described in our press release and investor presentation announcing the Sinclair Transactions.\nSinclair will become a significant holder of the combined company\u2019s common stock following completion of the Sinclair Transactions.\nOn a pro forma basis, based on our outstanding shares of common stock as of July 30, 2021, Sinclair will own 26.75% of the New Parent Common Stock following the closing of the Sinclair Transactions. Additionally, pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, the Sinclair Parties will be entitled to nominate (i) two persons to the board of directors of New Parent at the closing and for so long as the Sinclair Parties beneficially own common stock constituting not less than 15% of all outstanding New Parent Common Stock and (ii) one person to the Board for so long as the Sinclair Parties beneficially own less than 15% but more than or equal to 5% of all outstanding New Parent Common Stock. As a result, Sinclair (and the Sinclair Parties) will have the ability to influence our management and affairs. Further, the existence of a new significant stockholder may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers, delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in management, or limiting the ability of our other stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in the best interests of our company.\nSo long as Sinclair continues to control a significant amount of the New Parent Common Stock, it will continue to be able to influence all matters requiring stockholder approval, subject to the voting agreements of the Sinclair Parties set forth in the Stockholders Agreement. Moreover, this concentration of stock ownership may also adversely affect the trading price of the New Parent Common Stock to the extent investors perceive a disadvantage in owning stock of a company with a significant stockholder.\nThe Sinclair Transactions will expand our branded marketing and licensing business, and we could face a variety of risks as a result of this business expansion.\nThe Sinclair Transactions will expand our business into branded marketing and licensing business with the addition of over 300 distributors and 1,300 branded retail sites. Risks of our expanding this business line include, among others: (i) potential diversion of management\u2019s attention and other resources from our existing businesses; (ii) unanticipated liabilities or contingencies; (iii) the need for additional capital and other resources to integrate and expand this line of business; and (iv) inefficient combination or integration of operational and management systems and controls. Expanding this line of business may also lead to increased litigation and regulatory risk and could have an impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the expansion and integration of the branded marketing and licensing business could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nTable of Content\nLitigation relating to the Sinclair Transactions could result in substantial costs to HollyFrontier or an injunction preventing the completion of the Sinclair Transactions.\nSecurities class action lawsuits, derivative and related lawsuits are often brought against public companies that have entered into acquisition, merger or other business combination agreements. Even if such a lawsuit is without merit, defending against these claims can result in substantial costs and divert the time and resources of management. An adverse judgment could result in monetary damages, which could have a negative impact on our liquidity and financial condition.\nLawsuits that have been or may be brought against us and/or our directors could also seek, among other things, injunctive relief or other equitable relief, including a request to rescind parts of the acquisition agreement already implemented, issue additional disclosures and to otherwise enjoin the parties from consummating the Sinclair Transactions. We and the members of our Board of Directors were named as defendants in a lawsuit filed in Harris County, Texas, brought by an alleged HollyFrontier shareholder challenging the Sinclair Transactions and seeking, among other things, injunctive relief to enjoin and/or rescind the acquisition agreement and require defendants to amend the related proxy statement, declare a breach of fiduciary duties, provide correct and complete disclosures or enjoin or unwind the acquisition and share issuance if they do not, rescissory and compensatory damages, and interest, attorney\u2019s fees and other costs. Seven additional lawsuits were filed in federal courts on behalf of individual alleged HollyFrontier shareholders: Gerald Lovoi v. HollyFrontier Corp., et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-08805 (S.D.N.Y.); Jared Abrams v. HollyFrontier Corp., et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-09309 (S.D.N.Y.); Christopher Quayle v. HollyFrontier Corp., et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-03079 (D. Colo.); Shannon Jenkins v. HollyFrontier Corp., et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-09497 (S.D.N.Y.); William Bancroft v. HollyFrontier Corp., et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-09878 (S.D.N.Y.); Stanley Jacobs v. HollyFrontier Corp., et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-01668 (D. Del.); and Timothy Dolan v. HollyFrontier Corp., et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-01670 (D. Del.). All asserted claims under Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) and SEC Rule 14a-9 and claims under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against HollyFrontier and members of HollyFrontier\u2019s Board of Directors, and seeks, among other things, to enjoin and/or rescind the acquisition agreement and require defendants to amend the related proxy statement, and, if they do not, to recover damages. Additional lawsuits in connection with the Sinclair Transactions may be filed in the future in federal or state courts.\nHollyFrontier believes that the lawsuits described above are without merit, and that no further disclosure was required under applicable law. However, HollyFrontier made supplemental disclosures on November 30, 2021 to reduce the risk that the lawsuits may delay or otherwise adversely affect the consummation of the Acquisition and to minimize the expense of defending such action. HollyFrontier entered into a Settlement Agreement with the plaintiff in the lawsuit filed in Harris County, Texas and the lawsuit was voluntarily dismissed with prejudice. Since the shareholder vote on December 8, 2021, five of the lawsuits filed in federal courts have also been voluntarily dismissed: Bancroft v. HollyFrontier Corp. was voluntarily dismissed on December 13, 2021; Quayle v. HollyFrontier Corp. was voluntarily dismissed on December 21, 2021; Lovoi v. HollyFrontier Corp. was voluntarily dismissed on January 7, 2022; Abrams v. HollyFrontier Corp. was voluntarily dismissed on January 7, 2022; and Jenkins v. HollyFrontier Corp. was voluntarily dismissed on January 25, 2022. With respect to the two outstanding lawsuits, HollyFrontier\u2019s additional disclosures moot the claims therein.\nThe outcome of the remaining lawsuits or any other lawsuit that may be filed challenging the Sinclair Transactions is uncertain. One of the conditions to the closing of the Sinclair Transactions is that no injunction by any court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction has been entered and continues to be in effect and no law has been adopted or is effective, in either case, that prohibits or makes illegal the closing of the Sinclair Transactions. Consequently, if a plaintiff is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting completion of the Sinclair Transactions, that injunction may delay or prevent the Sinclair Transactions from being completed within the expected timeframe or at all, which could result in substantial costs to us and may adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operation and cash flows. Relatedly, the defense or settlement of any lawsuit or claim that remains unresolved at the time the Sinclair Transactions are completed may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and result in substantial costs to us. See Item 1, \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d for more information about litigation related to the Sinclair Transactions.\nRISKS RELATED TO GOVERNMENT REGULATION\nWe incur significant costs, and expect to incur additional costs in the future, to comply with existing, new and changing environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, and face potential exposure for environmental matters.\nOperations of our facilities, pipelines and distribution operations are subject to international, federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations regarding, among other things, the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation and distribution of petroleum and hazardous substances by pipeline, truck, rail, ship and barge, the emission and discharge of materials into the\nTable of Content\nenvironment, waste management, and characteristics and composition of gasoline and diesel fuels, and other matters otherwise relating to the protection of human health and the environment. Permits or other authorizations are required under these laws and regulations for the operation of our facilities, pipelines and related operations, and these permits and authorizations are subject to revocation, modification and renewal or may require operational changes, which may involve significant costs. A violation of permit conditions or a failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties; the imposition of investigatory, remedial or corrective action obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures; the occurrence of delays in the permitting, development or expansion of projects; the issuance of injunctive relief limiting or prohibiting certain operations; and reputational harm. There is also the potential for liability for spill response and remediation, natural resource damage claims, and personal and property damage claims in the event of an oil or other refined product spill at a facility located near federal or state waters or a release of hazardous substances.\nChanges in laws or regulations could require major modifications of our operations, including expensive upgrades to our existing pollution control equipment, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. For example, implementation of the revised NAAQS for ozone could result in stricter permitting requirements, a delay in or inability to obtain required permits, and increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant. Also, an EPA rule became effective in January 2018 that requires, among other things, benzene monitoring at refinery fence lines and submittal of fence line monitoring data to the EPA on a quarterly basis; upgraded storage tank controls requirements, including new applicability thresholds; enhanced performance requirements for flares, continuous monitoring of flares and pressure release devices, and analysis and remedy of flare release events; compliance with emissions standards for delayed coking units; and requirements related to air emissions resulting from startup, shutdown and maintenance events. These new rules, as well as subsequent rulemaking under the CAA or similar laws, or new agency interpretations of existing laws and regulations, may necessitate additional expenditures in future years and result in increased costs on our operations. Compliance with new international and domestic environmental laws, regulations and interpretations will continue to have an adverse impact on our operations, results of our operations and capital requirements.\nAs is the case with all companies engaged in industries similar to ours, we face potential exposure to future claims and lawsuits involving environmental matters. The matters include, but are not limited to, soil, groundwater and water discharges and contamination, air pollution, accident prevention and personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by substances which we processed, manufactured, handled, used, released or disposed.\nWe are and have been the subject of various local, state, provincial, federal, international and private proceedings relating to environmental regulations, conditions and inquiries. Instances of non-compliance with environmental regulations could require additional expenditures, including expenditures for investigation and remediation, which could be significant.\nOur operations are also subject to various international and domestic laws and regulations relating to occupational health and safety. We maintain safety, training and maintenance programs as part of our ongoing efforts to comply with applicable laws and regulations but cannot guarantee that these efforts will always be successful. Compliance with applicable health and safety laws and regulations has required and continues to require substantial expenditures. Failure to appropriately manage occupational health and safety risks associated with our business could also adversely impact our employees, communities, stakeholders, reputation and results of operations.\nThe costs of environmental and safety regulations are already significant and compliance with more stringent laws or regulations or adverse changes in the interpretation of existing regulations by government agencies or courts could have an adverse effect on the financial position and the results of our operations and could require substantial expenditures for the installation and operation of systems and equipment that we do not currently possess.\nWe are also subject to existing, and may in the future be subject to new or changing, domestic and international energy policy legislation. For example, in the United States, the Energy Independence and Security Act mandates annually increasing levels for the use of renewable fuels such as ethanol and increasing energy efficiency goals, among other steps. Dutch policy also aims to increase the share of renewable energy used in transportation and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transportation fuels. In Canada, fuel content legislation exists at the federal and provincial level. These statutory mandates may have the impact over time of offsetting projected increases in the demand for refined petroleum products, particularly gasoline, in certain markets. In the near term, the new renewable fuel standard presents ethanol production and logistics challenges for both the ethanol and refining industries and may require additional capital expenditures or expenses by us to accommodate increased ethanol use. Other legislative changes may similarly alter the expected demand and supply projections for refined petroleum products in ways that cannot be predicted.\nTable of Content\nFor additional information on regulations and related liabilities or potential liabilities affecting our business, see \u201cRegulation\u201d under Items 1 and 2, \u201cBusiness and Properties,\u201d and Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings.\u201d\nThere are various risks associated with greenhouse gases and climate change that could result in increased operating costs and litigation and reduced demand for the refined products we produce and investment in our industry.\nClimate change continues to attract considerable attention in the United States, Canada, Europe, and other regions. Numerous proposals have been made and could continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit existing emissions of greenhouse gases, or \u201cGHGs\u201d, to limit or eliminate future emissions, and to require or incentivize the use of lower-carbon or renewable alternatives. As a result, our operations, and those of our customers, are subject to a series of regulatory, political, litigation, and financial risks associated with the refining of petroleum products and emission of GHGs.\nThe EPA has adopted rules that, among other things, establish construction and operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources, require the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas sources in the United States or require control or reduction of emissions of GHGs, including methane, from such sources. In 2021, President Biden issued several executive orders that committed to substantial action on climate change and called for, among other things, the increased use of zero-emission vehicles by the federal government, the elimination of subsidies provided to the fossil fuel industry, and increased emphasis on climate-related risks across governmental agencies and economic sectors. Additionally, various states and groups of states have adopted or are considering adopting legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that are focused on such areas as GHG cap and trade programs, carbon taxes, reporting and tracking programs, restriction of emissions, electric vehicle mandates and combustion engine phaseouts.\nSimilar regulations exist at the provincial and federal levels in Canada, including a nation-wide GHG pricing initiative and regulations related to the control of GHGs from automobiles and light duty trucks and either cap and trade programs or carbon taxes in the provinces of Quebec, Ontario, and Alberta.\nThe Netherlands also participates in European legal initiatives, including GHG cap and trade programs. Furthermore, the Climate Act has come into effect with the goal of significantly reducing GHG emissions by 49% (compared to 1990) by 2030 and by at least 95% (compared to 1990) by 2050. The Climate Act also establishes that the government must prepare a Climate Plan. This plan contains, among others, the principles by which the Dutch government intends to achieve the goals set out in the Climate Act.\nAt the international level, the United Nations-sponsored \u201cParis Agreement\u201d requires member nations to limit their GHG emissions through nationally-determined reduction goals reevaluated every five years after 2020. The United States initially joined and then withdrew from such agreement in 2020. The United States rejoined the Paris Agreement in 2021 and issued its corresponding \u201cnationally determined contribution\u201d (\u201cNDC\u201d) to reduce economy-wide net GHG emissions to 50-52% below 2005 levels by 2030. While the NDC does not identify specific actions necessary to achieve these reductions, it lists several sectors as pathways for reductions, including the power, transportation, building, industrial, and agricultural sectors. The administration has acknowledged that a combination of regulatory actions and legislation will be necessary to achieve the U.S. NDC. EU member states have agreed to reduce emissions by at least 40% by 2030, and the Dutch government is advocating in Europe for a more-stringent 55% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030.\nThe adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce emissions of GHGs could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements. In November 2021, the United States enacted a nearly $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure law, which provided significant funding for electric vehicles and clean energy technologies. A separate climate spending bill known as the Build Back Better Act, which could impose a fee on methane emissions, among other GHG provisions, remains under consideration in the United States Congress. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the refined petroleum products that we produce. Additionally, political, litigation and financial risks may result in curtailed refinery activity, increased liability, or other adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere are also increasing risks of litigation related to climate change effects. Governments and third-parties have brought suit against some fossil fuel companies alleging, among other things, that such companies created public and private nuisances by producing fuels that contributed to climate change, such as rising sea levels, and therefore are responsible for roadway and infrastructure damages as a result, or alleging that the companies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change for some time but defrauded their investors or customers by failing to adequately disclose those impacts. For example, in the Netherlands, The Hague District Court has ordered Royal Dutch Shell (\u201cRDS\u201d) to reduce the CO2 emissions of the RDS group\nTable of Content\nby net 45% by 2030, compared to 2019 levels, through the RDS group's corporate policy. Although this judgment is still subject to appeal, other environmental organizations may bring similar cases against other parties. While we are not party to such suits at this time, we may become subject to such litigation in the future. Such cases could also adversely impact public perception and the demand for fossil fuels and petroleum products, which could subsequently result in decreased demand for our services and refined products and a drop in our stock price.\nIn addition, increasing societal expectations for companies to address environmental issues, including climate change, and increased consumer use of substitutes to energy commodities may result in increased costs, reduced demand for our products and our services, reduced profits, increased investigations and litigation, and negative impacts on our stock price and access to capital markets. To the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved, it is possible that such liability could be imposed on us without regard to our causation of or contribution to the asserted damage, or to other mitigating factors.\nFurthermore, our stock price could be adversely impacted if existing shareholders, including institutional investors, elect in the future to shift some or all of their investments into renewable energy or non-energy related sectors based on social and environmental considerations. In recent years institutional lenders have become more attentive to sustainable lending practices and have been lobbied intensively, and often publicly, by environmental activists, proponents of the international Paris Agreement, and foreign citizenry concerned about climate change not to provide funding for fossil fuel energy companies. Limitation of investments in and financings for fossil fuel energy companies could result in the restriction, delay or cancellation of drilling programs or development or production activities, could result in a reduction of available capital funding for potential development projects and could also adversely affect demand for our services and refined petroleum products, all of which could adversely impact our future financial results.\nPhysical impacts of climate change could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nScientists have noted that changes in the environment may produce climate changes that have significant effects on the weather. These events, including but not limited to drought, winter storms, wildfire, extreme temperatures, extreme precipitation or flooding, may become more intense or more frequent as a result of climate change and could have an adverse effect on our continued operations as well as the operations of our suppliers and customers. Additionally, changing meteorological conditions, particularly temperature, may result in changes to demand for our products. Our customers or suppliers may also be subject to similar risks, any of which may adversely impact our business, financial condition, or operations.\nThe availability and cost of renewable identification numbers and other required credits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nPursuant to the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act, the EPA promulgated the RFS regulations reflecting the increased volume of renewable fuels mandated to be blended into the nation's fuel supply. The regulations, in part, require refiners to add annually increasing amounts of \u201crenewable fuels\u201d to their petroleum products or purchase credits, known as RINs, in lieu of such blending. We currently purchase RINs for some fuel categories on the open market in order to comply with the quantity of renewable fuels we are required to blend under the RFS regulations. Since the EPA first began mandating biofuels in excess of the \u201cblend wall\u201d (the 10% ethanol limit prescribed by most automobile warranties), the price of RINs has been extremely volatile. While we cannot predict the future prices of RINs, the costs to obtain the necessary number of RINs could be material. If we are unable to pass the costs of compliance with the RFS regulations on to our customers, if sufficient RINs are unavailable for purchase, if we have to pay a significantly higher price for RINs or if we are otherwise unable to meet the RFS mandates, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn the past, we have received small refinery exemptions under the RFS program for certain of our refineries. However, there is no assurance that such an exemption will be obtained for any of our refineries in future years. For example, the EPA has recently proposed to deny all pending small refinery exemption petitions on the belief that small refineries are able to pass through compliance costs to customers. If finalized, this new approach to evaluating exemption petitions could result in the EPA no longer granting such exemptions. The failure to obtain such exemptions for certain of our refineries could result in the need to purchase more RINs than we currently have estimated and accrued for in our consolidated financial statements. The EPA recently promulgated new RFS regulations that could require the agency to increase the volume of renewable fuel or RINs that refiners are required to purchase if the agency anticipates it will grant small refinery exemptions. This also could increase the number of RINs we need to purchase. Additionally, the EPA recently announced a review of its decisions on the exemptions for the 2018 compliance year as part of ongoing litigation in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. It is not clear at this time what steps the EPA will take with respect to our 2018 small refinery exemptions, or what compliance obligations the EPA will impose should it reverse its decision on those exemptions.\nTable of Content\nIn addition, the RFS regulations are highly complex and evolving, requiring us to periodically update our compliance systems. The RFS regulations require the EPA to determine and publish the applicable annual volume and percentage standards for each compliance year by November 30 for the forthcoming year, and such blending percentages could be higher or lower than amounts estimated and accrued for in our consolidated financial statements. The future cost of RINs is difficult to estimate until such time as the EPA finalizes the applicable standards for the forthcoming compliance year, but the EPA does not always do so by the statutory deadline. For example, the EPA did not meet its November 30, 2020 statutory deadline to set the 2021 renewable volume obligations. However, on December 7, 2021, the EPA proposed renewable volume obligations for 2021 and 2022 along with a proposed reduction to the 2020 renewable volume obligations. The public comment period for the proposed renewable volume obligations closed on February 4, 2022. Moreover, in addition to increased price volatility in the RINs market, there have been multiple instances of RINs fraud occurring in the marketplace over the past several years. The EPA has initiated several enforcement actions against refiners who purchase fraudulent RINs, resulting in substantial costs to the refiner. We cannot predict with certainty our exposure to increased RINs costs in the future, nor can we predict the extent by which costs associated with RFS regulations will impact our future results of operations.\nIncreases in required fuel economy and regulation of CO2 emissions from motor vehicles may reduce demand for transportation fuels.\nThe EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (\u201cNHTSA\u201d) are required to promulgate requirements regarding the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (\u201cCAFE\u201d) of the nation's passenger fleet. The EPA and NHTSA previously adopted such standards, which standards were subsequently revised in December 2021 to impose more stringent requirements for emissions reductions. These rulemakings will likely be subject to challenge by a variety of parties seeking even stricter GHG and CAFE standards. Additionally, several states are seeking to promote zero emission vehicles, such as electric vehicles, and to mandate transition away from internal combustion engines. In the Climate Agreement, EU countries expressed the ambition to achieve completely emission-free road traffic by 2050. Any increases in fuel economy standards, along with mandated increases in use of renewable fuels discussed above, as well as electric vehicle mandates or combustion engine bans, could result in decreasing demand for petroleum fuels. Decreasing demand for petroleum fuels could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.\nCompliance with and changes in tax laws could materially and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to extensive tax liabilities, including federal and state income taxes and transactional taxes such as excise, sales and use, payroll, franchise, withholding and property taxes. In addition, many tax liabilities are subject to periodic audits by taxing authorities, and such audits could subject us to interest and penalties. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations could result in increased expenditures by us for tax liabilities in the future and could materially and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAdditionally, U.S. federal tax law provides various tax credits to producers of qualifying renewable fuels. These tax credits have the effect of making the production of qualifying renewable fuels more competitive by offsetting a portion of the production costs or by supplementing a portion of the revenue, but may be repealed by governmental action at any time. Alternatively, the types of renewable fuels to which these tax credits apply, as well as the applicable value, duration, and requirements, may be modified or amended by governmental action in a form where the types of fuel mixtures we produce are not eligible for the tax credits or are eligible for relatively less benefits than we anticipated. As a result, a loss of, or reduction in, U.S. federal tax credits for producers of qualifying renewable fuels could increase our production costs or decrease our revenues which, in turn, could adversely impact the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of our renewables business.\nTable of Content\nRISKS RELATED TO CYBERSECURITY, DATA SECURITY, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nCyberattacks or security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is dependent upon information technology systems and other digital technologies for controlling our plants and pipelines, processing transactions and summarizing and reporting results of operations. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of information is critical to our operations. We monitor our information technology systems on a 24/7 basis in an effort to detect cyberattacks, security breaches or unauthorized access. Preventative and detective measures we utilize include independent cybersecurity audits and penetration tests. We implemented these efforts along with other risk mitigation procedures to detect and address unauthorized and damaging activity on our network, stay abreast of the increasing cybersecurity threat landscape and improve our cybersecurity posture. While there have been immaterial incidents of unauthorized access to our information technology systems, we have not experienced any impact on our business or operations from these attacks. In addition, information technology system failures, communications network disruptions (whether intentional by a third party or due to natural disaster), and security breaches could still impact equipment and software used to control plants and pipelines, resulting in improper operation of our assets, potentially including delays in the delivery or availability of our customers\u2019 products, contamination or degradation of the products we transport, store or distribute, or releases of hydrocarbon products and other damage to our facilities for which we could be held liable.\nFurthermore, we collect and store sensitive data in the ordinary course of our business, including personally identifiable information of our employees as well as our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers, investors and other stakeholders. Despite our security measures, our information technology systems may become the target of cyberattacks or security breaches (including employee error, malfeasance or other breaches), which could result in the theft or loss of the stored information, misappropriation of assets, disruption of transactions and reporting functions, our ability to protect customer or company information and our financial reporting. Moreover, we may not be able to anticipate, detect or prevent cyberattacks or security breaches, particularly because the methodologies used by attackers change frequently or may not be recognized until such attack is launched, and because attackers are increasingly using technologies specifically designed to circumvent cybersecurity measures and avoid detection. Even with insurance coverage for cyberattacks, data breaches or unauthorized access of our information technology systems, a claim could be denied or coverage delayed. In addition, as technologies evolve, and cyberattacks become increasingly sophisticated, we may incur significant costs to modify, upgrade or enhance our security measures to protect against such cyberattacks and we may face difficulties in fully anticipating or implementing adequate security measures or mitigating potential harm. A cyberattack or security breach could result in liability under data privacy laws, regulatory penalties, damage to our reputation or a loss of confidence in our products and services, or additional costs for remediation and modification or enhancement of our information systems to prevent future occurrences, all of which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may be subject to information technology system failures, communications network disruptions and data breaches.\nWe depend on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of hardware and software systems and infrastructure, including our operating, communications and financial reporting systems. These systems are critical in meeting customer expectations, effectively tracking, maintaining and operating our equipment, directing and compensating our employees, and interfacing with our financial reporting system. We have implemented safeguards and other preventative measures to protect our systems and data, including sophisticated network security and internal control measures; however, our information technology systems and communications network, and those of our information technology and communication service providers, remain vulnerable to interruption by natural disasters, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks, Internet failures, computer malware, ransomware, cyberattacks, data breaches and other events unforeseen or generally beyond our control. Additionally, the implementation of social distancing measures and other limitations on our employees, service providers and other third parties in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have necessitated in certain cases to switching to remote work arrangements on less secure systems and environments. The increase in companies and individuals working remotely has increased the risk of cyberattacks and potential cybersecurity incidents, both deliberate attacks and unintentional events.\nOur business is subject to complex and evolving global laws, regulations and security standards regarding privacy, cybersecurity and data protection (\u201cdata protection laws\u201d). Many of these data protection laws are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and could result in claims, increased cost of operations, or other harm to our business.\nThe constantly evolving regulatory and legislative environment surrounding data privacy and protection poses increasingly complex compliance challenges, and complying with such data protection laws could increase the costs and complexity of compliance. While we do not collect significant amounts of personal information from consumers, we do have personal information from our employees, job applicants and some business partners, such as contractors and distributors. Any failure,\nTable of Content\nwhether real or perceived, by us to comply with applicable data protection laws could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments, and negative publicity, require us to change our business practices, increase the costs and complexity of compliance, and adversely affect our business. Our compliance with laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation, and other similar privacy/security laws, as well as any associated inquiries or investigations or any other government actions related to these laws, may increase our operating costs.\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property, which may increase our cost of doing business or otherwise hurt our ability to compete in the market.\nWe use intellectual property in the ordinary course of our business, including trademarks, trade secrets, copyrighted work and innovations, some of which is material to our business. We take measures to identify and protect our intellectual property through practices appropriate for securing and protecting exclusive rights in and to our intellectual property, including applying for registrations in the United States and in various foreign countries. Despite our efforts to protect such intellectual property, it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain, copy, use or disclose our trademarks (or other marks likely to cause confusion among our consumers), technologies, products and processes. In addition, the laws and/or judicial systems and enforcement mechanisms of foreign countries in which we create, market and sell our products may afford little or no effective protection of our intellectual property. We may also be subject to infringement complaints from others challenging our use of a technology. We cannot guarantee that our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights against unauthorized use and appropriation, or our efforts to defend against third party claims of infringement would be successful. These potential risks to our intellectual property could subject us to increased competition and negatively impact our liquidity, financial position and results of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations under license or technology agreements with third parties or are unable to license rights to use technologies on reasonable terms, we may be required to pay damages or could potentially lose license rights that are critical to our business.\nWe obtain licenses to certain intellectual property, including technologies, data, content and software from third parties, that are important to our business, and in the future we may enter into additional agreements that provide us with licenses to valuable intellectual property or technology. If we fail to comply with any of the obligations under our license agreements, we may be required to pay damages and the licensor may have the right to terminate the license. Termination by the licensor would cause us to lose valuable rights, and could prevent us from selling our products and services, or inhibit our ability to commercialize future products and services. Our business could suffer if any current or future licenses terminate, if the licensors fail to abide by the terms of the license, if the licensed intellectual property rights are found to be invalid or unenforceable, if the licensed technology is found to infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate the rights of a third party, or if we are unable to enter into necessary licenses on acceptable terms. Moreover, our licensors may own or control intellectual property that has not been licensed to us and, as a result, we may be subject to claims, regardless of their merit, that we are infringing or otherwise violating the licensor\u2019s rights.\nIn the future, we may identify additional third-party intellectual property that we believe is necessary to engage in our business. However, such licenses may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. The licensing or acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights is a competitive area, and several companies may pursue strategies to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights that we may consider attractive or necessary. In addition, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us. Even if such licenses are available, we may be required to pay the licensor substantial royalties based on sales of our products and services. Such royalties are a component of the cost of our products or services and may affect the margins on our products and services. In addition, such licenses may be non-exclusive, which could give our competitors access to the same intellectual property licensed to us. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND CREDIT\nWe may not be able to obtain funding on acceptable terms or at all because of volatility and uncertainty in the credit and capital markets. This may hinder or prevent us from meeting our future capital needs.\nThe domestic and global financial markets and economic conditions are disrupted and volatile from time to time due to a variety of factors, including low consumer confidence, high unemployment, geoeconomic and geopolitical issues, weak economic conditions and uncertainty in the financial services sector. In addition, the fixed-income markets have experienced periods of extreme volatility, which negatively impacted market liquidity conditions. Recently, the equity and debt markets for many energy industry companies have been adversely affected by low oil prices. As a result, the cost of raising money in the debt and equity capital markets has increased substantially at times while the availability of funds from these markets\nTable of Content\ndiminished significantly. In particular, as a result of concerns about the stability of financial markets generally and the solvency of lending counterparties specifically, the cost of obtaining money from the credit markets may increase as many lenders and institutional investors increase interest rates, enact tighter lending standards, refuse to refinance existing debt on similar terms or at all and reduce, or in some cases cease to provide, funding to borrowers. In addition, lending counterparties under any existing revolving credit facility and other debt instruments may be unwilling or unable to meet their funding obligations, or we may experience a decrease in our capacity to issue debt or obtain commercial credit or a deterioration in our credit profile, including a rating agency lowering or withdrawing of our credit ratings if, in its judgment, the circumstances warrant. Due to these factors, we cannot be certain that new debt or equity financing will be available on acceptable terms. If funding is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to meet our obligations as they come due or we may be required to sell assets. Moreover, without adequate funding, we may be unable to execute our growth strategy, complete future acquisitions or construction projects, take advantage of other business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, comply with regulatory requirements, or meet our short-term or long-term working capital requirements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements in a timely manner or meet our short-term or long-term working capital requirements could subject us to regulatory action.\nWe are exposed to the credit risks, and certain other risks, of our key customers and vendors.\nWe are subject to risks of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from contracts with key customers. Additionally, certain key customers of the recently-acquired Puget Sound Refinery contribute significantly to the cash flows and profitability of that facility. Any default or delay in payment by, or disputes with, those customers could have an adverse impact on our financial results.\nIf any of our key customers default on their obligations to us, our financial results could be adversely affected. Furthermore, some of our customers may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating and regulatory risks. For example, in a low commodity price environment, certain of our customers have been or could be negatively impacted, causing them significant economic stress and resulting in an increase in nonpayment and/or nonperformance by them. Any such default or delay in payment by our customers could negatively affect our operating results in the periods in which they occur, and, if significant, could materially or adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, nonperformance by vendors who have committed to provide us with products or services could result in higher costs or interfere with our ability to successfully conduct our business.\nAny substantial increase in the nonpayment and/or nonperformance by our customers or vendors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges in our credit profile, or a significant increase in the price of crude oil, may affect our relationship with our suppliers, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and limit our ability to purchase sufficient quantities of crude oil to operate our refineries at desired capacity.\nAn unfavorable credit profile, or a significant increase in the price of crude oil, could affect the way crude oil suppliers view our ability to make payments and induce them to shorten the payment terms of their invoices with us or require credit enhancement. Due to the large dollar amounts and volume of our crude oil and other feedstock purchases, any imposition by our suppliers of more burdensome payment terms or credit enhancement requirements on us may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to make payments to our suppliers. This in turn could cause us to be unable to operate our refineries at desired capacity. A failure to operate our refineries at desired capacity could adversely affect our profitability and cash flow.\nOur credit facility contains certain covenants and restrictions that may constrain our business and financing activities.\nThe operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our credit facility and any future financing agreements could adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage, expand or pursue our business activities. For example, our revolving credit facility imposes usual and customary requirements for this type of credit facility, including: (i) limitations on liens and indebtedness; (ii) a prohibition on changes in control and (iii) restrictions on engaging in mergers and consolidations. If we fail to satisfy the covenants set forth in the credit facility or another event of default occurs under the credit facility, the maturity of the loan could be accelerated or we could be prohibited from borrowing for our future working capital needs and issuing letters of credit. We might not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these immediate payments. If we desire to undertake a transaction that is prohibited by the covenants in our credit facility, we will need to obtain consent under our credit facility. Such refinancing may not be possible or may not be available on commercially acceptable terms.\nTable of Content\nOur hedging transactions may limit our gains and expose us to other risks.\nWe periodically enter into derivative transactions as it relates to inventory levels and/or future production to manage the risks from changes in the prices of crude oil, refined products and other feedstocks. These transactions limit our potential gains if commodity prices move above or below the certain price levels established by our hedging instruments. We hedge price risk on inventories above our target levels to minimize the impact these price fluctuations have on our earnings and cash flows. Consequently, our hedging results may fluctuate significantly from one reporting period to the next depending on commodity price fluctuations and our relative physical inventory positions. These transactions may also expose us to risks of financial losses; for example, if our production is less than we anticipated at the time we entered into a hedge agreement or if a counterparty to our hedge agreements fails to perform its obligations under the agreements.\nWe have temporarily suspended our quarterly dividends and may be unable to pay future dividends.\nIn connection with the acquisition of the Puget Sound Refinery, our Board of Directors approved a one-year suspension of the regular quarterly dividend effective with the dividend to be declared for the first quarter of 2021. Although we expect to resume the quarterly dividend after the one-year suspension period, we will only be able to pay dividends from our available cash on hand, cash from operations or borrowings under our credit agreement. The declaration of future dividends on our common stock is evaluated quarterly and will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including our results of operations, financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, and restrictions in our debt agreements and legal requirements. We cannot assure you that any dividends will be paid or the frequency or amounts of such payments.", "PERMNO": 32803, "SIC": 2911, "TIC": "HFC"}
