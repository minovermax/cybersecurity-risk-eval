{"cik": "927003", "company": "ADVANCED ENERGY INDUSTRIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-02", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth below, any of which could cause our results to be adversely impacted and could result in a decline in the value or loss of an investment in our common stock. Other factors may also exist that we cannot anticipate or that we currently do not consider to be significant based on information that is currently available. These risks and uncertainties have the potential to materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and future results. Such risks and uncertainties may also impact the accuracy of forward-looking statements included in this Form 10-K and other reports we file with the SEC.\nCOVID-19 (\u201cCoronavirus\u201d) and the Impact on our Business\nAs we have grown our locations worldwide, our risk to regional and worldwide viruses and diseases has also grown. For example, the continuing spread in early 2020 of the Coronavirus and related government actions may adversely affect our manufacturing locations in China and worldwide. If the Coronavirus continues on its current path, we may see adverse impact on our ability (a) to manufacture, test, service and ship our products, (b) to get required materials and sub-assemblies to build and service our products and (c) to staff labor and management for manufacturing, research and development, supply chain, service and administrative operations. Further, we may experience adverse impact with our global supply chain partners and transportation service providers. Our customers may also delay orders should our products be included as a subsystem into their systems. The Coronavirus could adversely impact our near-term and long-term revenues, earnings and cash flow and will require expenditures in the short-term to address the current situation in Asia. This situation is developing rapidly, and other impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently. We have created a rapid response team to mitigate risks we are aware of and as they arise.\nThe industries in which we compete are subject to volatile and unpredictable cycles.\nAs a supplier to the global semiconductor equipment, telecom & networking, data center computing and industrial & medical industries, we are subject to business cycles, the timing, length, and volatility of which can be difficult to predict. Certain of these industries historically have been cyclical due to sudden changes in customers\u2019 manufacturing capacity requirements and spending, which depend in part on capacity utilization, demand for customers\u2019 products, inventory levels relative to demand, and access to affordable capital. These changes have affected the timing and amounts of customers\u2019 purchases and investments in technology, and continue to affect our orders, net sales, operating expenses, and net income. In addition, we may not be able to respond adequately or quickly to the declines in demand by reducing our costs. We may be required to record significant reserves for excess and obsolete inventory as demand for our products changes.\nTo meet rapidly changing demand in each of the industries we serve, we must effectively manage our resources and production capacity. During periods of decreasing demand for our products, we must be able to appropriately align our cost structure with prevailing market conditions, effectively manage our supply chain, and motivate and retain key employees. During periods of increasing demand, we must have enough manufacturing capacity and inventory to fulfill customer orders, effectively manage our supply chain, and attract, retain, and motivate a sufficient number of qualified individuals. If we are not able to timely and appropriately adapt to changes in our business environment or to accurately assess where we are positioned within a business cycle, our business, financial condition, or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. For example, following record levels of demand in the first half of 2018, the semiconductor equipment market experienced a decline, and, as a result, Advanced Energy\u2019s revenue from the semiconductor equipment market declined 24.5% during 2019, as compared to 2018. Although the semiconductor equipment market improved during the fourth quarter of 2019, it is unclear at this time if the market will recover to previous levels. In addition, the market may be characterized in the future with more \u201cmini-ramps\u201d rather than sustained growth periods as experienced during 2015-2017. In addition, our Data Center Computing and Telecom Networking markets are characterized by large program investments, which can cause variations in quarterly or annual revenues.\nDeterioration of economic conditions could negatively impact our business.\nOur business may be adversely affected by changes in national or global economic conditions, including inflation, interest rates, availability of capital markets, consumer spending rates, energy availability and costs (including fuel surcharges) and the effects of government initiatives to manage economic conditions. Any such changes could adversely affect the demand for our products both in domestic and export markets, or the cost and availability of our needed raw materials and packaging materials, thereby negatively affecting our financial results.\nA disruption in credit and other financial markets and deterioration of national and global economic conditions, could, among other things:\n\u25cf negatively impact global demand for our products, which could result in a reduction of sales, operating income and cash flows;\n\u25cf make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain financing for our operations or investments or to refinance our debt in the future;\n\u25cf cause our lenders to depart from prior credit industry practice and make more difficult or expensive the granting of any technical or other waivers under our debt agreements to the extent we may seek them in the future;\n\u25cf decrease the value of our investments; and impair the financial viability of our insurers.\nOur long-term success and results of operations depend on our ability to successfully integrate Artesyn\u2019s business and operations and realize the anticipated benefits from the acquisition.\nIn September 2019, we acquired Artesyn Embedded Technologies, Inc.\u2019s (\u201cArtesyn\u201d) Embedded Power business, and we are currently in the early stages of combining Artesyn\u2019s Embedded Power business with our business. The acquisition of Artesyn\u2019s Embedded Power business has significantly increased our embedded power product offerings, increased our exposure to the industrial and medical, datacenter computing, and telecom networking end markets, and significantly increased the number of employees and facilities. We believe there is minimal product overlap\nbetween Artesyn\u2019s Embedded Power business and our other acquisitions, including the acquisition of Excelsys Technologies in 2017. To realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, we must successfully combine our businesses in an efficient and effective manner and realize our synergy and cost-savings targets. Integrating Artesyn\u2019s Embedded Power business and operations with ours will require significant management attention, efforts and expenditures, and we may not be able to achieve the integration in an effective, complete, timely or cost-efficient manner.\nPotential risks related to our acquisition of Artesyn\u2019s Embedded Power business include our ability to:\n\u25cf maintain and improve Artesyn\u2019s financial and operating results while integrating and optimizing our combined sales, marketing, manufacturing and corporate administrative organizations;\n\u25cf avoid lost revenue due to customer confusion, alienation or misinformation regarding the transaction, and retain and expand Artesyn\u2019s customer base with aligning our sales efforts;\n\u25cf avoid lost revenue resulting from the distraction or confusion of our personnel as a consequence of the acquisition and ongoing integration efforts;\n\u25cf optimize our combined worldwide manufacturing footprint while utilizing Artesyn\u2019s vertically integrated manufacturing model for a broader set of company products;\n\u25cf realize expected synergies and cost savings across the organization while managing our existing businesses, contracts and relationships;\n\u25cf successfully eliminate fixed costs previously absorbed by other businesses prior to the transaction;\n\u25cf recognize and capitalize on anticipated product sales and technology enhancement opportunities presented by our combined businesses;\n\u25cf expand our financial and management controls and reporting systems and procedures to integrate and manage Artesyn;\n\u25cf integrate our information technology systems to mitigate cyber-security risks and enable the management and operation of the combined business;\n\u25cf effectively manage risks related to Artesyn\u2019s foreign operations, including foreign currency risk, geographic risks, and local employee related risks;\n\u25cf integrate Artesyn into our global tax structure and manage the related impact on our current and future tax rates as a result of the acquisition;\n\u25cf identify and retain key Artesyn personnel and transition their critical knowledge;\n\u25cf adequately familiarize us with Artesyn\u2019s products and technology and certain of its markets and customer base such that we can manage Artesyn\u2019s business effectively;\n\u25cf successfully integrate our respective corporate cultures such that we achieve the benefits of acting as a unified company; and\n\u25cf meet target deadlines in achieving regulatory compliance.\nOther potential risks related to our acquisition of Artesyn\u2019s Embedded Power business include:\n\u25cf the assumption of unknown or contingent liabilities, or other unanticipated events or circumstances; and\n\u25cf the potential to incur or record significant cash or non-cash charges or write down the carrying value of intangible assets and goodwill obtained in the Artesyn acquisition, which could adversely impact our cash flow or lower our earnings in the period or periods for which we incur such charges or write down such assets.\nIf we are unable to successfully or timely integrate the operations of Artesyn\u2019s Embedded Power business into our business, we may be unable to realize the revenue growth, synergies, cost-savings and other anticipated benefits resulting from the acquisition and our business could be adversely affected. Additionally, we have incurred and will continue to incur transaction-related costs, including legal, regulatory and other costs associated with implementing integration plans, including facilities and systems consolidation costs and employment-related costs. Although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, should allow us to offset transaction and integration-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all. Further, we may not realize the expected benefits from the acquisition. Artesyn\u2019s\nEmbedded Power business and operations may not achieve the anticipated revenues and operating results. Any of the foregoing risks could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur debt obligations and the restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our debt could limit our ability to operate our business or pursue our business strategies, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, and could significantly reduce stockholder benefits from a change of control event.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our total debt was $341.3 million, excluding unamortized debt issuance costs, of which $17.5 million was classified as current. We are contractually obligated to make quarterly payments of $4.4 million, plus accrued interest, with any outstanding balance due in September 2024. Our debt obligations could make us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions and could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate, thereby placing us at a disadvantage to our competitors that have less indebtedness.\nOur debt obligations impose financial covenants on us and our subsidiaries that require us to maintain a certain leverage ratio. The financial covenants place certain restrictions on our business that may affect our ability to execute our business strategy successfully or take other actions that we believe would be in the best interests of our Company. These restrictions include limitations or restrictions, among other things, on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to:\n\u25cf incur additional indebtedness;\n\u25cf pay dividends or make distributions on our capital stock or certain other restricted payments or investments;\n\u25cf make domestic and foreign investments and extend credit;\n\u25cf engage in transactions with affiliates;\n\u25cf transfer and sell assets;\n\u25cf effect a consolidation or merger or sell, transfer, lease, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u25cf create liens on our assets to secure debt.\nOur debt obligations contain certain customary events of default. Any breach of the covenants or other event of default could cause a default on our debt obligations, which could restrict our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility. If there were an event of default under certain provisions of our debt arrangements that was not cured or waived, the holders of the defaulted debt may be able to cause all amounts outstanding with respect to the debt instrument, plus any required settlement costs, to be due and payable immediately. Our assets and cash flow may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default. If we are unable to repay, refinance, or restructure our indebtedness as required, or amend the covenants contained in these agreements, the lenders can exercise all rights and remedies available under such outstanding debt instruments or applicable laws or equity. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nSignificant developments stemming from recent U.S. government actions and proposals concerning tariffs and other economic proposals could have a material adverse effect on us.\nRecent U.S. government actions are imposing greater restrictions and economic disincentives on international trade impacting imports and exports. The U.S. government has adopted changes, and intends to adopt further changes, to trade policy and in some cases, to renegotiate, or potentially terminate, certain existing bilateral or multi-lateral trade agreements. It has initiated the imposition of additional tariffs on certain foreign goods, including steel and aluminum, semiconductor manufacturing equipment and spare parts thereof. Additionally, the government may also propose export rule changes that lower the percentage of permissible U.S. content for certain non-U.S. manufactured goods being sold to companies on the U.S. Entity List, further restrict the sale of foreign-made goods that are based on U.S. technology, and regulate the use of any U.S. origin content in certain manufacturing equipment used to produce goods for certain companies.\nExamples of recent actions are tariffs on steel and aluminum product imports announced by the U.S. Department of Commerce in March 2018, the scope of which increased on Feb. 8, 2020, and a 25% tariff on certain products that originate in China announced by the United States Trade Representative (\u201cUSTR\u201d) in June 2018. The USTR also announced in June and July 2018 two additional supplemental lists of products that are subject to tariffs if the goods imported into the United States originate in China, which would increase the cost of imported products. These supplemental lists issued by the USTR added an additional 25% on certain semiconductor equipment and parts originating in China that are sold by us or used in our business in the United States. In August 2018, the second list was made effective with a 25% tariff and in September 2018 the third list was made effective with a 10% tariff, increasing to 25% in May 2019. A fourth list was proposed by USTR in May 2019 for all remaining items originating in China. A portion of the fourth list (\u201c4a\u201d), was made effective September 1, 2019, with an additional tariff of 15%, reduced to 7.5% on February 14, 2020. The remainder of the fourth list (\u201c4b\u201d) was scheduled to have an additional tariff of 15% go into effect on December 15, 2019, however on December 13, 2019, the tariffs for list 4b were suspended after the U.S. announced it would enter into a trade agreement with China (the \u201cPhase 1 Agreement\u201d). The Phase 1 Agreement is expected to have no impact on the tariffs imposed on Company products. Any increase in the cost of importing such goods and parts could decrease our margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary parts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business results, results of operations, or financial condition.\nThe U.S. Department of Commerce is currently considering proposed rules that decrease the amount of U.S. origin content allowed for non-U.S. manufactured products that are sold to companies on the U.S. Entity List, expand the restrictions on the sale of foreign-made goods that are based on U.S. technology or software, and regulate the use of U.S. origin semiconductor manufacturing equipment that produces semiconductor devices for certain companies. At this time, the potential rule changes are not anticipated to impact the Company\u2019s sales of non-U.S. products; however, the developments in this area are fast-moving and any unpredicted rule changes could adversely affect our business results, operations or financial condition.\nChanges in U.S. trade policy could result in one or more U.S. trading partners adopting responsive trade policy making it more difficult or costly for us to export our products to those countries. As indicated above, these measures could also result in increased costs for goods imported into the U.S. This in turn could require us to increase prices to our customers which may reduce demand, or, if we are unable to increase prices, result in lowering our margin on goods and services sold. To the extent that trade tariffs and other restrictions imposed by the U.S. increase the price of semiconductor equipment and related parts imported into the U.S., the cost of our materials may be adversely affected and the demand from customers for products and services may be diminished, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nWe cannot predict future trade policy, the terms of any renegotiated trade agreements or additional imposed tariffs and their impact on our business. The adoption and expansion of trade restrictions, the occurrence of a trade war, or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies has the potential to adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, our customers, our suppliers, and the U.S. economy, which in turn could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in U.S. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories and countries where we currently develop and sell products, and any negative sentiments towards the United States as a result of such changes, could adversely affect our business. In addition, negative sentiments towards the United States among non-U.S. customers and among non-U.S. employees or prospective employees could adversely affect sales or hiring and retention, respectively.\nOur operations in the People\u2019s Republic of China are subject to significant political and economic uncertainties over which we have little or no control and we may be unable to alter our business practice in time to avoid reductions in revenues.\nA significant portion of our operations outside the United States are located in the PRC, which exposes us to risks, such as exchange controls and currency restrictions, changes in local economic conditions, changes in customs regulations and tariffs, changes in tax policies, changes in PRC laws and regulations, possible expropriation or other\nPRC government actions, and unsettled political conditions including potential changes in U.S. policy regarding overseas manufacturing. In addition, Artesyn added a significant additional footprint in both facilities and resources in the PRC. These factors may have a material adverse effect on our operations, business, results of operations, and financial condition. See \"We are exposed to risks associated with worldwide financial markets and the global economy\" risk factor below.\nThe PRC\u2019s economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including with respect to the amount of government involvement, level of development, rate of growth, control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources. While the economy of the PRC has experienced significant growth in the past 20 years, growth has been uneven across different regions and amongst various economic sectors of the PRC. The PRC government has implemented various measures to encourage economic development and guide the allocation of resources. Strikes by workers and picketing in front of the factory gates of certain companies in Shenzhen have caused unrest among some workers seeking higher wages, which could impact our manufacturing facility in Shenzhen. While some of the government\u2019s measures may benefit the overall economy of the PRC, they may have a negative effect on us. For example, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations that are applicable to us as well as work stoppages.\nWe are subject to risks inherent in international operations.\nSales to our customers outside the United States were approximately 59.2% and 48.4% of our total sales for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The international acquisitions have increased our presence in international locations. Our success producing goods internationally and competing in international markets is subject to our ability to manage various risks and difficulties, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf our ability to effectively manage our employees at remote locations who are operating in different business environments from the United States;\n\u25cf our ability to develop and maintain relationships with suppliers and other local businesses;\n\u25cf compliance with product safety requirements and standards that are different from those of the United States;\n\u25cf variations and changes in laws applicable to our operations in different jurisdictions, including enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights;\n\u25cf trade restrictions, political instability, disruptions in financial markets, and deterioration of economic conditions;\n\u25cf customs regulations and the import and export of goods (including customs audits in various countries that occur from time to time);\n\u25cf the ability to provide enough levels of technical support in different locations;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain business licenses that may be needed in international locations to support expanded operations;\n\u25cf timely collecting accounts receivable from foreign customers including significant balances in accounts receivable from foreign customers as of December 31, 2019;\n\u25cf collection of accounts receivable from foreign customers can also be unexpectedly delayed beyond our payment terms if the project itself is delayed and/or government funded. For example, tariffs and slower growth have impacted certain of our Chinese markets which have delayed projects. If these projects are permanently delayed or cancelled it could have a negative impact on our financial results or projections;\n\u25cf changes in tariffs, taxes, and foreign currency exchange rates; and\n\u25cf recent protests and rioting in Hong Kong have affected travel in the region and may result in governmental actions that could impact business in the region.\nOur profitability and ability to implement our business strategies, maintain market share and compete successfully in international markets will be compromised if we are unable to manage these and other international risks successfully.\nOur product lines are manufactured only at a few sites and our sites are not generally interchangeable.\nOur power products for the semiconductor industry are manufactured in Shenzhen, PRC. Our high voltage products are manufactured in Ronkonkoma and Lockport, New York, Littlehampton, United Kingdom and Shenzhen, PRC. Our thermal instrumentation products are manufactured in Vancouver, Washington, Santa Clara, California, Littlehampton, United Kingdom and Frankfurt, Germany. Our pyrometry solutions are manufactured in Ballerup, Denmark and Santa Clara, California. Our Telecom & Networking and Data Center Computing products are manufactured in Zhongshan, PRC, Rosario, Philippines and Santa Rosa, Philippines. Some of Artesyn\u2019s Embedded Power business\u2019 products will be contract manufactured by the carved-out former Artesyn consumer group at their Luoding, China facility until September 2020. Each facility is under operating lease and interruptions in operations could be caused by early termination of existing leases by landlords or failure by landlords to renew existing leases upon expiration, including the possibility that suitable operating locations may not be available in proximity to existing facilities which could result in labor or supply chain risks. Each facility manufactures different products, and therefore, is not interchangeable. Natural, uncontrollable occurrences or other operational issues at any of our manufacturing facilities could significantly reduce our productivity at such site and could prevent us from meeting our customers\u2019 requirements in a timely manner, or at all. For example, recent concerns regarding the spread of the Coronavirus and related government actions may result in temporary shut-down of our facilities and impact availability of materials supply and manufacturing employees, particularly in our China operations. Any potential losses from such occurrences could significantly affect our relationship with customers, operations and results of operations for a prolonged period. As a result, we are investing in additional production options in Malaysia. We believe this investment will help to mitigate our exposure to regional risks, improve our business continuity profile and lower costs over time.\nOur restructuring and other cost reduction efforts have included transitioning manufacturing operations to our facility in Shenzhen from other manufacturing facilities, such as Fort Collins, Colorado and Littlehampton, United Kingdom, which renders us increasingly reliant upon our Shenzhen facility. We have been notified that we will be required to relocate our Shenzhen, PRC manufacturing facility by December 2021. A disruption in manufacturing at our Shenzhen facility, from whatever cause, could have a significantly adverse effect on our ability to fulfill customer orders, our ability to maintain customer relationships, our costs to manufacture our products and, as a result, our results of operations and financial condition. To mitigate these risks, we are investing in a dual manufacturing facility in Penang, Malaysia that will be capable of manufacturing our semiconductor and other products. We have begun pilot production for qualification and expect to open the facility in 2020.\nOur evolving manufacturing footprint may increase our risk.\nThe nature of our manufacturing is evolving as we continue to grow by acquisition. Historically, our principal manufacturing location has been in Shenzhen, PRC; however, we have also added specialized manufacturing at our Littlehampton, United Kingdom, Ballerup, Denmark, Frankfurt, Germany, Ronkonkoma and Lockport, New York and Santa Clara, California facilities. From time to time we may be required to or we may choose to relocate manufacturing or migrate manufacturing of specific products between facilities or to third party manufacturers as part of our cost consolidation efforts. A disruption in supply because of these manufacturing relocations could have a significantly adverse effect on our ability to fulfill customer orders. We have been notified that we will be required to relocate our Shenzhen, PRC manufacturing facility by December 2021. If we do not successfully coordinate the timely manufacturing and distribution of our products during this time, we may have insufficient supply of products to meet customer demand, we could lose sales, we may experience a build-up in inventory, or we may incur additional costs. In addition, we are investing in a second factory in Malaysia to help mitigate business continuity, geopolitical and other risks. If we do not successfully implement this factory it could result in increased expenses and disruption of supply to our customers during the transition period.\nIn addition, the acquisition of Artesyn\u2019s Embedded Power business added significant vertically integrated manufacturing sites in China and the Philippines. These sites represent large fixed costs which are difficult to flex as economic and other conditions change. If we do not successfully integrate these operations and operate them in an efficient manner, we could experience greater losses in times of revenue reduction.\nWith the acquisition of Artesyn, our strategy is to optimize and reduce our manufacturing footprint over the next several years primarily in China and the Philippines. Our strategy will require the expenditure on facilities, employee severance and other related operations. If we are not successful in this strategy, we may impact our manufacturing capability and not reduce long-term costs as we had planned.\nRaw material, part, component, and subassembly shortages, exacerbated by our dependence on sole and limited source suppliers, could affect our ability to manufacture products and systems and could delay our shipments.\nOur business depends on our ability to manufacture products that meet the rapidly changing demands of our customers. Our ability to timely manufacture our products depends in part on the timely delivery of raw materials, parts, components, and subassemblies from suppliers. We rely on sole and limited source suppliers for some of our raw materials, parts, components, and subassemblies that are critical to the manufacturing of our products.\nThis reliance involves several risks, including the following:\n\u25cf the inability to obtain an adequate supply of required parts, components, or subassemblies;\n\u25cf supply shortages, if a sole or limited source provider ceases operation;\n\u25cf the need to fund the operating losses of a sole or limited source provider;\n\u25cf reduced control over pricing and timing of delivery of raw materials and parts, components, or subassemblies;\n\u25cf the need to qualify alternative suppliers;\n\u25cf suppliers that may provide parts, components or subassemblies that are defective, contain counterfeit goods or are otherwise misrepresented to us in terms of form, fit or function;\n\u25cf the inability of our suppliers to develop technologically advanced products to support our growth and development of new products;\n\u25cf the impact of geopolitical issues or tariffs that could affect the cost and availability of required parts, components, or subassemblies; and\n\u25cf the impact of regional or global health issues and related actions could affect the availability of required parts, components, or subassemblies.\nFrom time to time, our sole or limited source suppliers have given us notice that they are ending supply of critical parts, components, and subassemblies that are required for us to deliver product. If we cannot qualify alternative suppliers before ending supply of critical parts from the sole or limited source suppliers, we may be required to make a last-time-buy(s) and take possession of material amounts of inventory in advance of customer demand. In some instances, the last-time-buy materials required to be purchased may be for several years which in turn exposes us to additional excess and obsolescence risk. If we cannot qualify alternative suppliers before the last-time-buy materials are utilized in our products or legacy inverter warranty operations, we may be unable to deliver further product or legacy inverter warranty service to our customers.\nQualifying alternative suppliers could be time consuming and lead to delays in, or prevention of delivery of products to our customers, as well as increased costs. If we are unable to qualify additional suppliers and manage relationships with our existing and future suppliers successfully, if our suppliers experience financial difficulties including bankruptcy, or if our suppliers cannot meet our performance or quality specifications or timing requirements, we may experience shortages, delays, or increased costs of raw materials, parts, components, or subassemblies. This in turn could limit or prevent our ability to manufacture and ship our products, which could materially and adversely affect our relationships with our current and prospective customers and our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur orders of raw materials, parts, components, and subassemblies are based on demand forecasts.\nWe place orders with many of our suppliers based on our customers\u2019 quarterly forecasts and our annual forecasts. These forecasts are based on our customers\u2019 and our expectations as to demand for our products. As the quarter and the year progress, such demand can change rapidly or we may realize that our customers\u2019 expectations were overly optimistic or pessimistic, especially when industry or general economic conditions change. Orders with our\nsuppliers cannot always be amended in response. In addition, in order to assure availability of certain components or to obtain priority pricing, we have entered into contracts with some of our suppliers that require us to purchase a specified amount of components and subassemblies each quarter, even if we are not able to use such components or subassemblies. Moreover, we have obligations to some of our customers to hold a minimum amount of finished goods in inventory, in order to fulfill just in time orders, regardless of whether the customers expect to place such orders. We currently have firm purchase commitments and agreements with various suppliers to ensure the availability of components. If demand for our products does not continue at current levels, we might not be able to use all of the components that we are required to purchase under these commitments and agreements, and our reserves for excess and obsolete inventory may increase, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. If demand for our products exceeds our customers\u2019 and our forecasts, we may not be able to timely obtain enough raw materials, parts, components, or subassemblies, on favorable terms or at all, to fulfill the excess demand.\nIncreased governmental action on income tax regulations could negatively impact our business.\nInternational governments have heightened their review and scrutiny of multinational businesses like ours which could increase our compliance costs and future tax liability to those governments. As governments continue to look for ways to increase their revenue streams, they could increase audits of companies to accelerate the recovery of monies perceived as owed to them under current or past regulations. Such an increase in audit activity could have a negative impact on companies which operate internationally, as we do.\nActivities necessary to integrate acquisitions may result in costs in excess of current expectations or be less successful than anticipated.\nWe have completed acquisitions in the past and we may acquire other businesses in the future. The success of such transactions will depend on, among other things, our ability to integrate assets and personnel acquired in these transactions and to apply our internal controls process to these acquired businesses. The integration of acquisitions may require significant attention from our management, and the diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manage our business. Furthermore, we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipated when we first entered into the acquisition transaction. If actual integration costs are higher than amounts originally anticipated, if we are unable to integrate the assets and personnel acquired in an acquisition as anticipated, or if we are unable to fully benefit from anticipated synergies, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, our efforts to optimize our manufacturing footprint through consolidation and relocation resulting from acquisitions may result in a disruption in our ability to supply our customers which could adversely affect our operations.\nWe have historically made acquisitions and divestitures. However, we may not find suitable acquisition candidates in the future and we may not be able to successfully integrate and manage acquired businesses. In either an acquisition or a divestiture, we may be required to make fundamental changes in our ERP, business processes and tools which could disrupt our core business and harm our financial condition.\nIn the past, we have made strategic acquisitions of other corporations and entities, as well as asset purchases, and we continue to evaluate potential strategic acquisitions of complementary companies, products, and technologies. We have also divested businesses. In the future, we could:\n\u25cf issue stock that would dilute our current stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership;\n\u25cf pay cash that would decrease our working capital;\n\u25cf incur debt;\n\u25cf assume liabilities; or\n\u25cf incur expenses related to impairment of goodwill and amortization.\nAcquisitions and divestitures also involve numerous risks, including:\n\u25cf problems combining or separating the acquired/divested operations, systems, technologies, or products;\n\u25cf an inability to realize expected sales forecasts, operating efficiencies or product integration benefits;\n\u25cf difficulties in coordinating and integrating geographically separated personnel, organizations, systems, and facilities;\n\u25cf difficulties integrating business cultures;\n\u25cf unanticipated costs or liabilities;\n\u25cf diversion of management\u2019s attention from our core business;\n\u25cf adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;\n\u25cf potential loss of key employees, particularly those of purchased organizations;\n\u25cf incurring unforeseen obligations or liabilities in connection with either acquisitions or divestitures; and\n\u25cf the failure to complete acquisitions even after signing definitive agreements which, among other things, would result in the expensing of potentially significant professional fees and other charges in the period in which the acquisition or negotiations are terminated.\nWe may not be able to successfully identify appropriate acquisition candidates, to integrate any businesses, products, technologies, or personnel that we might acquire in the future or achieve the anticipated benefits of such transactions, which may harm our business.\nWe may be unable to realize expected benefits from our cost reduction and restructuring efforts\nIn order to operate more efficiently and control costs, we announce from time to time restructuring plans, which include workforce reductions, global facility optimizations or consolidations and other cost reduction initiatives. These plans are intended to generate operating expense savings through reductions in direct and indirect expenses as well as improved efficiencies. These types of cost reduction and restructuring activities are complex. If we do not successfully manage our current restructuring activities, or any future restructuring activities, expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized, and our operations and business could be disrupted.\nChanges in tax laws, tax rates, or mix of earnings in tax jurisdictions in which we do business, could impact our future tax liabilities and related corporate profitability\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and earnings higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses, acquisitions (including integrations) and investments, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, and changes in the relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations, including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. The U.S., many countries in the European Union, and several other countries are actively considering changes in this regard. The acquisition of Artesyn may change our mix of earnings in various tax jurisdictions and may impact our overall current or future tax rate.\nChanges in our provision for income taxes or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results\nOur provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates; by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; by changes, regulations, and interpretations of foreign-derived intangible income (FDII), global intangible low-tax income (GILTI) and base erosion and anti-abuse tax laws (BEAT); by expiration of or lapses in tax incentives; by transfer pricing adjustments, including the effect of acquisitions on our legal structure; by tax effects of nondeductible compensation; by tax costs related to intercompany realignments; by changes in accounting principles; or by changes in tax laws and regulations, treaties, or interpretations thereof, including changes to the taxation of earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, the deductibility of expenses\nattributable to foreign income, and the foreign tax credit rules. Significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attribute prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an international association comprised of 36 countries, including the United States, has made changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. There can be no assurance that these changes, once adopted by countries, will not have an adverse impact on our provision for income taxes. Further, as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates. Our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. In addition, we are subject of regular examination of our income tax returns by tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with worldwide financial markets and the global economy.\nOur business depends on the expansion of manufacturing capacity in our end markets and the installation base for the products we sell. In the past, severe tightening of credit markets, turmoil in the financial markets, and a weakening global economy have contributed to slowdowns in the industries in which we operate. Some of our key markets depend largely on consumer spending. Economic uncertainty, such as that recently experienced in the PRC, exacerbates negative trends in consumer spending and may cause our customers to push out, cancel, or refrain from placing orders.\nDifficulties in obtaining capital and uncertain market conditions may also lead to a reduction of our sales and greater instances of nonpayment. These conditions may similarly affect our key suppliers, which could affect their ability to deliver parts and result in delays for our products. Further, these conditions and uncertainty about future economic conditions could make it challenging for us to forecast our operating results and evaluate the risks that may affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. As discussed in \"Our orders of raw materials, parts, components, and subassemblies are based on demand forecasts,\" a significant percentage of our expenses are relatively fixed and based, in part, on expectations of future net sales. If a sudden decrease in demand for our products from one or more customers were to occur, the inability to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for any shortfall would magnify the adverse impact of a shortfall in net sales on our results of operations. Conversely, if market conditions were to unexpectedly improve and demand for our products were to increase suddenly, we might not be able to respond quickly enough, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations and customer relations.\nOur results of operations could be affected by natural disasters and other events in the locations in which we or our customers or suppliers operate.\nWe have manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather and geological events including earthquakes or tsunamis that could disrupt operations. In addition, our suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations. A natural disaster, fire, explosion, public health issue (for example, an outbreak of a pandemic disease such as Coronavirus, avian influenza, measles or Ebola) or other event that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations, or the operations of our customers or suppliers, may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe transitioned a significant amount of our supply base to Asian suppliers.\nWe transitioned the purchasing of a substantial portion of components for our products to Asian suppliers to lower our materials costs and shipping expenses. These components might require us to incur higher than anticipated testing or repair costs, which would have an adverse effect on our operating results. Customers who have strict and extensive qualification requirements might not accept our products if these lower-cost components do not meet their requirements. A delay or refusal by our customers to accept such products, as well as an inability of our suppliers to meet our purchasing requirements, might require us to purchase higher-priced components from our existing suppliers or might cause us to lose sales to these customers, either of which could lead to decreased revenue and gross margins and have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe must continually design and introduce new products into the markets we serve to respond to competition and rapid technological changes.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment where innovation is critical, our future success depends on many factors, including the effective commercialization and customer acceptance of our products and services. The development, introduction and support of a broadening set of products is critical to our continued success. Our results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not continue to develop new products (including software and firmware capabilities), improve and develop new applications for existing products, and differentiate our products from those of competitors resulting in their adoption by customers.\nWe must achieve design wins to retain our existing customers and to obtain new customers, although design wins achieved do not necessarily result in substantial sales.\nDriven by continuing technology migration and changing customers demand the markets we serve are constantly changing in terms of advancement in applications, core technology and competitive pressures. New products we design for capital equipment manufacturers typically have a lifespan of five to ten years. Our success and future growth depend on our products being designed into our customers new generations of equipment as they develop new technologies and applications. We must work with these manufacturers early in their design cycles to modify, enhance and upgrade our products or design new products that meet the requirements of their new systems. The design win process is highly competitive, and we may win or lose new design wins for our existing customers or new customers next generations of equipment. In case existing or new customers do not choose our products as a result of the development, evaluation and qualification efforts related to the design win process, our market share will be reduced, the potential revenues related to the lifespan of our customers\u2019 products, which can be five to ten years, will not be realized, and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely impacted.\nWe generally have no long-term contracts with our customers requiring them to purchase any specified quantities from us.\nOur sales are primarily made on a purchase order basis, and we generally have no long-term purchase commitments from our customers, which is typical in the industries we serve. As a result, we are limited in our ability to predict the level of future sales or commitments from our current customers, which may diminish our ability to allocate labor, materials, and equipment in the manufacturing process effectively. In addition, we may purchase inventory in anticipation of sales that do not materialize, resulting in excess and obsolete inventory write-offs.\nIf we are unable to adjust our business strategy successfully for some of our product lines to reflect the increasing price sensitivity on the part of our customers, our business and financial condition could be harmed.\nOur business strategy for many of our product lines has been focused on product performance and technology innovation to provide enhanced efficiencies and productivity. As a result of recent economic conditions and changes in various markets that we serve, our customers have experienced significant cost pressures. We have observed increased price sensitivity on the part of our customers. If competition against any of our product lines should come to focus solely on price rather than on product performance and technology innovation, we will need to adjust our business strategy and product offerings accordingly, and if we are unable to do so, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur competitive position could be weakened if we are unable to convince end users to specify that our products be used in the equipment sold by our customers.\nThe end users in our markets may direct equipment manufacturers to use a specified supplier\u2019s product in their equipment at a particular facility. This occurs with frequency because our products are critical in manufacturing process control for thin-film applications. Our success, therefore, depends in part on our ability to have end users specify that our products be used at their facilities. In addition, we may encounter difficulties in changing established relationships of competitors that already have a large installed base of products within such facilities.\nThe markets we operate in are highly competitive.\nWe face substantial competition, primarily from established companies, some of which have greater financial, marketing, and technical resources than we do. We expect our competitors will continue to develop new products in direct competition with ours, improve the design and performance of their products, and introduce new products with enhanced performance characteristics including software and firmware capabilities. In order to remain competitive, we must improve and expand our products and product offerings. In addition, we may need to maintain a high level of investment in research and development and expand our sales and marketing efforts, particularly outside of the United States. We might not be able to make the technological advances and investments necessary to remain competitive. If we were unable to improve and expand our products and product offerings, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nA significant portion of our sales and accounts receivable are concentrated among a few customers.\nOur ten largest customers accounted for 57.3%, 62.5% and 70.4% of our sales for the year ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2019, sales to Applied Materials, Inc. and Lam Research were $164.7 million and $88.3 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2018 sales to Applied Materials, Inc., and Lam Research were $258.0 million and $109.0 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2017, sales to Applied Materials, Inc., and Lam Research were $224.8 million and $155.3 million, respectively. A new customer, Nidec Motor Corporation, acquired in connection with the acquisition of Artesyn\u2019s Embedded Power business, had a $38.1 million accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2019. Applied Material, Inc. had a $36.8 million and $34.3 million accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. In addition, the Company has several large customers in China dependent on the Chinese government for project funding. A significant decline in sales from these or other large customers, or the Company\u2019s inability to collect on these sales, could materially and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe maintain significant amounts of cash in international locations.\nGiven the global nature of our business, we have both domestic and international concentrations of cash and investments. The value of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, economic risk, political risk, sovereign risk or other factors. The Company intends to utilize its foreign cash to expand our international operations through internal growth and strategic acquisitions. If our intent changes or if these funds are needed for our U.S. operations, or we are negatively impacted by any of the factors above, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nGlobalization of sales increases risk of compliance with policy.\nWe operate in an increasingly complex sales environment around the world which places greater importance on our global control environment and imposes additional oversight risk. Such increased complexity could adversely affect our operating results by increasing compliance costs in the near-term and by increasing the risk of control failures in the event of non-compliance.\nMarket pressures and increased low-cost competition may reduce or eliminate our profitability.\nOur customers continually exert pressure on us to reduce our prices and extend payment terms. Given the nature of our customer base and the highly competitive markets in which we compete, we may be required to reduce our prices or extend payment terms to remain competitive. We have recently seen pricing pressure from our largest customers due in part to low-cost competition and market consolidation. As a result of the competitive markets we serve, from time to time we may enter into long term pricing agreements with our largest customers that results in reduced product pricing. Such reduced product pricing may result in product margin declines unless we are successful in reducing our product costs ahead of such price reductions. In addition, our newly acquired business competes in markets that are more price competitive which may include dual or multi sourcing. We believe some of our Asian competitors benefit from local governmental funding incentives and purchasing preferences from end-user customers in their\nrespective countries. Moreover, in order to be successful in the current competitive environment, we are required to accelerate our investment in research & development to meet time-to-market, performance and technology adoption cycle needs of our customers simply in order to compete for design wins, and if successful, receive potential purchase orders. Given such up-front investments we must make and the competitive nature of our markets, we may not be able to reduce our expenses in an amount enough to offset potential margin declines or loss of business and may not be able to meet customer product time-line expectations. The potential decrease in cash flow could materially and adversely impact our financial condition.\nWe are highly dependent on our intellectual property.\nOur success depends significantly on our proprietary technology. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through patents and non-disclosure agreements; however, we might not be able to protect our technology, and competitors might be able to develop similar technology independently. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries might not afford our intellectual property the same protections as do the laws of the United States. Our intellectual property is not protected by patents in several countries in which we do business, and we have limited patent protection in other countries, including the PRC. The cost of applying for patents in foreign countries and translating the applications into foreign languages requires us to select carefully the inventions for which we apply for patent protection and the countries in which we seek such protection. Generally, our efforts to obtain international patents have been concentrated in the European Union and certain industrialized countries in Asia, including Korea, Japan, and Taiwan. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property successfully, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe PRC commercial law is relatively undeveloped compared to the commercial law in the United States. Limited protection of intellectual property is available under PRC law. Consequently, manufacturing our products in the PRC may subject us to an increased risk that unauthorized parties may attempt to copy our products or otherwise obtain or use our intellectual property. We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights effectively. Additionally, we may not have adequate legal recourse if we encounter infringements of our intellectual property in the PRC.\nOur legacy inverter products may suffer higher than anticipated litigation, damage or warranty claims.\nOur legacy inverter products (of which we discontinued the manufacture, engineering, and sale in December 2015 and which are reflected as Discontinued Operations in this filing) contain components that may contain errors or defects and were sold with original product warranties ranging from one to ten years with an option to purchase additional warranty coverage for up to 20 years. If any of our products are defective or fail because of their design, we might be required to repair, redesign or recall those products or to pay damages (including liquidated damages) or warranty claims, and we could suffer significant harm to our reputation. We are experiencing increasing claims from customers and suppliers and increasing litigation related to the legacy inverter product line. We review such claims and vigorously defend against such lawsuits in the ordinary course of our business. We cannot assure that any such claims or litigation brought against us will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial statements. Our involvement in such litigation could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. We also accrue a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services including the cost of technical support, product repairs, and product replacement for units that cannot be repaired. Our estimate of costs to fulfill our warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions. To the extent we experience increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims, our warranty accrual will increase, resulting in additional expenses in the line \"Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax\u201d on our Consolidated Statement of Operations in future periods. We plan to continue supporting inverter customers with service maintenance and repair operations. This includes performing service to fulfill obligations under existing service maintenance contracts. There is no certainty that these can be performed profitably and could be adversely affected by higher than anticipated product failure rates, loss of critical service technician skills, an inability to obtain service parts, customer demands and disputes and cost of repair parts, among other factors. See Note 4. Disposed and Discontinued Operations in Part II, Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" contained herein.\nOur products may suffer from defects or errors leading to damage or warranty claims.\nOur products use complex system designs and components that may contain errors or defects, particularly when we incorporate new technology into our products or release new versions. If any of our products are defective or fail because of their design, we might be required to repair, redesign or recall those products, pay damages (including liquidated damages) or warranty claims, and we could suffer significant harm to our reputation. We accrue a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services including the cost of technical support, product repairs, and product replacement for units that cannot be repaired. Our estimate of costs to fulfill our warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions. To the extent we experience increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims, our warranty accrual will increase, resulting in decreased gross profit. In recent years, we have experienced increased warranty costs for our legacy inverter product lines, which is reflected in \"Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes.\" See Note 4. Disposed and Discontinued Operations in Part II, Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" contained herein.\nUnfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations may lead to lower operating margins, or may cause us to raise prices, which could result in reduced sales.\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our sales and results of operations, and we could experience losses with respect to forward exchange contracts into which we may enter. Unfavorable currency fluctuations could require us to increase prices to foreign customers, which could result in lower net sales by us to such customers. Alternatively, if we do not adjust the prices for our products in response to unfavorable currency fluctuations, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, most sales made by our foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the currency of the country in which these products are sold and the currency in which they receive payment for such sales could be less valuable at the time of receipt as a result of exchange rate fluctuations. Given recent acquisitions in Europe and Asia, our exposure to fluctuations in the value of the Euro and Chinese Yuan is becoming more significant. From time to time, we enter into forward exchange contracts and local currency purchased options to reduce currency exposures related to likely or pending transactions including those arising from intercompany sales of inventory. However, we cannot be certain that our efforts will be adequate to protect us against significant currency fluctuations or that such efforts will not expose us to additional exchange rate risks, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nRecent developments relating to the United Kingdom\u2019s referendum vote in favor of leaving the European Union and related actions could adversely affect us.\nOn June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom (UK) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (\"EU\"). On January 23, 2020, the UK left the EU, which is commonly referred to as \"Brexit\". The UK and the EU are now in a transitionary period through the end of 2020. Negotiation on the UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU as well as its relationship with the EU going forward, including the terms of trade between the UK and the EU, is unclear. Although it is unknown what those terms will be, it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the UK and EU countries and increased regulatory complexities. These changes may adversely affect our sales, operations and financial results. Our operations in the UK may be adversely affected by extreme fluctuations in the UK exchange rates. Moreover, the imposition of any import restrictions and duties levied on our UK products as imported for EU customers may make our products more expensive for such customers and less competitive from a pricing perspective.\nChanges in the value of the Chinese yuan could impact the cost of our operation in the PRC and our sales growth in our PRC markets.\nThe PRC government is continually pressured by its trading partners to allow its currency to float in a manner like other major currencies. Any change in the value of the Chinese yuan may impact our ability to control the cost of our products in the world market. Specifically, the decision by the PRC government to allow the yuan to begin to float against the United States dollar could significantly increase the labor and other costs incurred in the operation of our Shenzhen and Zhongshan facilities and the cost of raw materials, parts, components, and subassemblies that we source in the PRC, thereby having a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nDifficulties with our enterprise resource planning (\"ERP\") system and other parts of our global information technology system could harm our business and results of operation.\nLike many multinational corporations, we maintain a global information technology system, including software products licensed from third parties. The acquisition of Artesyn\u2019s Embedded Power business adds additional information systems that are initially different from current systems. Any system, network or Internet failures, misuse by system users, government intervention, the hacking into or disruption caused by unauthorized access or loss of license rights could disrupt our ability to timely and accurately manufacture and ship products or to report our financial information in compliance with the timelines mandated by the SEC. Any such failure, misuse, hacking, unauthorized access, disruptions or loss would likely cause a diversion of management\u2019s attention from the underlying business and could harm our operations. In addition, a significant failure of our global information technology system could adversely affect our ability to complete an evaluation of our internal controls and attestation activities pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nIf our network security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer\u2019s data or our data or our information technology systems, we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities.\nAs part of our day-to-day business, we store our data and certain data about our customers in our global information technology system. Unauthorized access to our data, including any regarding our customers, could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, loss of business, litigation and possible liability. These security measures may be breached by intentional misconduct by computer hackers, as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise. Additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers\u2019 data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our information technology systems. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any security breach could result in a loss of confidence by our customers, damage our reputation, disrupt our business, lead to legal liability and negatively impact our future sales.\nOur business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and international laws and regulations regarding privacy and data protection. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation and could result in claims, changes to our business practices, penalties, increased cost of operations, or declines in user growth or engagement, or otherwise harm our business.\nRegulatory authorities around the world are considering several legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection, including measures to ensure that encryption of users\u2019 data does not hinder law enforcement agencies\u2019 access to that data. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. These legislative and regulatory proposals, if adopted, and such interpretations could, in addition to the possibility of fines, result in an order requiring that we change our data practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.\nRecent legal developments in Europe have created compliance uncertainty regarding certain transfers of personal data from Europe to the United States. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"), effective in the EU starting on May 25, 2018, applies to all our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or related to products and services that we offer to EU users. The GDPR creates a range of new compliance obligations, which could cause us to change our business practices, and will significantly increase financial penalties for noncompliance (including possible fines of up to 4% of global annual turnover for the preceding financial year or \u20ac20 million (whichever is higher) for the most serious infringements). Moreover, the China cybersecurity law enacted in 2017 and subsequent regulations and interpretations create compliance and data access risks for multinational corporations such as our Company.\nThe loss of any of our key personnel could significantly harm our results of operations and competitive position.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon the continuing contributions of our key management, technical, marketing, and sales employees. We may not be successful in retaining our key employees or attracting or retaining additional skilled personnel as required. Failure to retain or attract key personnel could significantly harm our results of operations and competitive position. Our success in hiring and retaining employees depends on a variety of factors, including the attractiveness of our compensation and benefit programs, global economic or political and industry conditions, our organizational structure, our reputation, culture and working environment, competition for talent and the availability of qualified employees, the availability of career development opportunities, and our ability to offer a challenging and rewarding work environment. We must develop our personnel to provide succession plans capable of maintaining continuity during the inevitable unpredictability of personnel retention. While we have plans for key management succession and long-term compensation plans designed to retain our senior employees, if our succession plans do not operate effectively, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe have been, and in the future may again be, involved in litigation. Litigation is costly and could result in further restrictions on our ability to conduct business or make use of market relationships we have developed, or an inability to prevent others from using technology.\nLitigation may be necessary to enforce our commercial or property rights, to defend ourselves against claimed violations of such rights of others, or to protect our interests in regulatory, tax, customs, commercial, and other disputes or similar matters. In particular, we have been experiencing increased litigation related to our legacy inverter product line and an adverse court ruling in any of our cases could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Litigation often requires a substantial amount of our management\u2019s time and attention, as well as financial and other resources, including:\n\u25cf substantial costs in the form of legal fees, fines, and royalty payments;\n\u25cf restrictions on our ability to sell certain products or in certain markets;\n\u25cf an inability to prevent others from using technology we have developed; and\n\u25cf a need to redesign products or seek alternative marketing strategies.\nAny of these events could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nReturn on investments or interest rate declines on plan investments could result in additional unfunded pension obligations for our pension plans.\nWe currently have unfunded obligations to our pension plans. The extent of future contributions to the pension plan depends heavily on market factors such as the discount rate used to calculate our future obligations and the actual return on plan assets which enable future payments. We estimate future contributions to the plans using assumptions with respect to these and other items. Changes to those assumptions could have a significant effect on future contributions. Additionally, a material deterioration in the funded status of the plan could increase pension expenses and reduce our profitability. See Note 17. Pension Liability in Part II, Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" contained herein.\nFunds associated with our marketable securities that we have traditionally held as short-term investments may not be liquid or readily available.\nIn the past, certain of our investments have been affected by external market conditions that impacted the liquidity of the investment. We do not currently have investments with reduced liquidity, but external market conditions that we cannot anticipate or mitigate may impact the liquidity of our marketable securities. Any changes in the liquidity associated with these investments may require us to borrow funds at terms that are not favorable or repatriate cash from international locations at a significant cost. We cannot be certain that we will be able to borrow funds or continue to repatriate cash on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to do so, our available cash may be reduced until those investments can be liquidated. The lack of available cash may prevent us from taking advantage of business\nopportunities that arise and may prevent us from executing some of our business plans, either of which could cause our business, financial condition or results of operations to be materially and adversely affected.\nOur intangible assets may become impaired.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we have $202.9 million of goodwill and $184.0 million in intangible assets. We periodically review the estimated useful lives of our identifiable intangible assets, taking into consideration any events or circumstances that might result in either a diminished fair value, or for intangible assets, a revised useful life. The events and circumstances include significant changes in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, and competition. Any impairment or revised useful life could have a material and adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations and could harm the trading price of our common stock.\nWe are subject to numerous governmental regulations.\nWe are subject to federal, state, local and foreign regulations, including environmental regulations and regulations relating to the design and operation of our products and control systems and regulations governing the import, export and customs duties related to our products. We might incur significant costs as we seek to ensure that our products meet safety and emissions standards, many of which vary across the states and countries in which our products are used. In the past, we have invested significant resources to redesign our products to comply with these directives. Compliance with future regulations, directives, and standards could require us to modify or redesign some products, make capital expenditures, or incur substantial costs. Also, we may incur significant costs in complying with the numerous imports, exports and customs regulations as we seek to sell our products internationally. If we do not comply with current or future regulations, directives, and standards:\n\u25cf we could be subject to fines and penalties;\n\u25cf our production or shipments could be suspended; and\n\u25cf we could be prohibited from offering particular products in specified markets.\nIf we were unable to comply with current or future regulations, directives and standards, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nFinancial reform legislation will result in new laws and regulations that may increase our costs of operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \"Dodd-Frank Act\") requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations, and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. On August 22, 2012, under the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC adopted new requirements for companies that use certain minerals and metals, known as conflict minerals, in their products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. These requirements require companies to perform due diligence, disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. We must perform sufficient due diligence to determine whether such minerals are used in the manufacture of our products. With regard to our acquisition of Artesyn, we will need to complete due diligence over the minerals used in the manufacture of those products. In addition, we incur costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals and metals used in our products. Since our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins for these minerals and metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. In such event, we may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who require that all the components of our products are certified as conflict mineral free.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate for reasons over which we have no control.\nThe stock market has from time to time experienced, and is likely to continue to experience, extreme price and volume fluctuations. Prices of securities of technology companies have been especially volatile and have often fluctuated for reasons that are unrelated to their operating performance. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in\nthe market price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation. If we were the subject of securities class action litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nOur operating results are subject to fluctuations, and if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our share price may decrease significantly.\nOur annual and quarterly results may vary significantly depending on various factors, many of which are beyond our control. Because our operating expenses are based on anticipated revenue levels, our sales cycle for development work is relatively long, and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed for the short term, a small variation in the timing of recognition of revenue can cause significant variations in operating results from period to period. If our earnings do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the price of our stock could decline.", "PERMNO": 82547, "SIC": 3679, "TIC": "AEIS"}
