{"cik": "1517401", "company": "Peak Resorts Inc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-07-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nYou should carefully read and consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information set forth in this annual report on Form 10-K. Our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely harmed by any of the following risks. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also significantly impair our business operations.\nRisks Related to the Company -\nOur industry is sensitive to weakness in the economy, and we are subject to risks associated with the overall leisure industry.\nWeak economic conditions in the U.S. could have a material adverse effect on our industry. An economic downturn could reduce consumer spending on recreational activities such as those our resorts offer, resulting in decreased skier visits and consumer spending at our ski resorts. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, we may be unable to increase the price of our lift tickets, season passes or other offerings during an economic downturn despite our history of being successful in raising such prices under a variety of economic conditions.\nOur business is vulnerable to the risk of unseasonably warm weather conditions and skier perceptions of weather conditions.\nThe ability to attract visitors to our resorts is influenced by weather conditions and by the number of cold weather days during the ski season. Unseasonably warm weather can adversely affect skier visits and our revenue and profits. For example, warm weather may result in inadequate natural snowfall and render snowmaking wholly or partially ineffective in maintaining quality skiing conditions. Also, the early season snow conditions and skier perceptions of early season snow conditions influence the momentum and success of the overall season. There is no way for us to predict future weather\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\npatterns, including any such patterns caused by climate change, or the impact that weather patterns may have on our results of operations or visitation.\nOur business is highly seasonal and the occurrence of certain events during our peak times could have a negative effect on our revenues.\nOur resort operations are highly seasonal. Although the air temperatures and timing and amount of snowfall can influence the number and type of skier visits, the majority of the skier visits are from mid-December to early April. Accordingly, during the past two fiscal years, we generated, on average, 87.6 % of our revenues during the third and fourth fiscal quarters. In addition, throughout our peak quarters, we generate the highest revenues on weekends and during three major holiday periods: Christmas, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day and Presidents Day. During the 2016/2017 ski season, we generated 30.8% of our revenues on weekends and 23.9% of our revenues during these three major holiday periods. Our resorts typically experience operating losses and negative cash flows during the first and second quarters of each fiscal year, as a result of the seasonality of our business. Operating results for any three-month period are not indicative of the results that may be achieved for any subsequent quarter or for a full fiscal year.\nA high degree of seasonality in our revenues and our dependence on weekends and the three major ski holidays increases the impact of certain events on our operating results. Adverse weather conditions, equipment failures, and other developments of even moderate or limited duration occurring during these peak business periods could significantly reduce our revenues.\nWe may not be able to fully utilize our net operating loss carryforwards.\nWe believe that uncertainty exists with respect to the future realization of the loss carryforwards as well as with respect to the amount of the loss carryforwards that will be available in future periods. To the extent available, we intend to use these net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income associated with our operations. There can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient taxable income in the carryforward period to utilize any remaining loss carryforwards before they expire.\nIn addition, Section 382 and related provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"), contains rules that limit for U.S. federal income tax purposes the ability of a company that undergoes an \"ownership change\" to utilize its net operating losses and certain other tax attributes existing as of the date of such ownership change. Under these rules, such an ownership change is generally an increase in ownership by one or more \"five percent shareholders,\" within the meaning of Section 382 of the Code, of more than 50% of a company's stock, directly or indirectly, within a rolling three-year period. In connection with our initial public offering in November 2014, a change of ownership in the Company occurred pursuant to the provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. As a result, usage of our net operating loss carryforwards will be limited each year; however, we believe the full benefit of those carryforwards will be realized prior to their respective expiration dates.\nVariations in the timing of peak periods, holidays and weekends may affect the comparability of our results of operations.\nDepending on how peak periods, holidays and weekends fall on the calendar, in any given year we may have more or fewer peak periods, holidays and weekends in our third fiscal quarter compared to prior years, with a corresponding difference in our fourth fiscal quarter. These differences can result in material differences in our quarterly results of operations and affect the comparability of our results of operations.\nWe compete with other leisure activities and ski resorts, which makes maintaining our customer base difficult.\nThe skiing industry is highly competitive and capital intensive. Our ski resorts located in the Northeastern U.S., such as Hunter Mountain, Mount Snow, Attitash and Wildcat Mountain, and those located in the Southeastern U.S. (which includes Pennsylvania for purposes of ski industry statistics), such as Jack Frost and Big Boulder, compete against other ski resorts in their markets for both day and overnight drive skiers. Our competitive position depends on a number of factors, such as the quality and coverage of snowmaking operations, resort size, the attractiveness of terrain, lift ticket prices, prevailing weather conditions, the appeal of related services and resort reputation. Some of our competitors have stronger competitive positions in respect of one or more of these factors, which may adversely affect our ability to maintain or grow our customer base.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe believe that while our Midwestern U.S. ski resorts face only limited competition from other ski resorts in the area, our competitors in the Midwest primarily include other recreation resorts, including warm weather resorts and various alternative leisure activities. Our resorts in the Northeastern and Southeastern U.S. face similar competition, in addition to the competition outlined above. Our ability to maintain our levels of skier visits depends on, among other things, weather conditions, costs of lift tickets and related skier services relative to the costs of other leisure activities and our ability to attract people interested in recreational sports.\nChanges in consumer tastes and preferences may affect skier visits at our ski resorts.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract visitors to our ski resorts. Changes in consumer tastes and preferences, particularly those affecting the popularity of skiing, snowboarding and tubing, and other social and demographic trends could adversely affect the number of skier visits during a ski season. Furthermore, a reduction in average household income in some of the areas near our resorts, compared to historic levels, combined with the increasing cost of skiing, snowboarding and tubing, may make these activities unaffordable for a large percentage of that population. A significant decline in skier visits compared to historical levels would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe declared our first quarterly cash dividend on our common stock in January 2015 and continued to declare quarterly dividends through January 2016 at a quarterly rate of $0.1375 per share. The board made the decision in April 2016 that it would not be prudent to declare a dividend due to lower cash levels primarily caused by the delay in approval of our EB-5 Program, as well as the unseasonably warm weather during the 2015/2016 ski season which drove down revenue compared to the prior season. Additionally debt covenant compliance restricted the Company from being able to declare dividends during a portion of fiscal 2017. Though the board approved the reinstatement of the dividend in February 2017 at the lower quarterly rate of $0.07 per share, we cannot assure you that this dividend rate will be sustained or that we will continue to pay dividends in the future. The declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend on many factors, including our actual results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, restrictions in our debt agreements, economic conditions and other factors that could differ materially from our current expectations.\nFurthermore, from and after the date that is nine months from the date of issuance, cumulative dividends shall accrue on the Series A Preferred Stock on a daily basis in arrears at the rate of 8% per annum on the liquidation value of $1,000 per share. The Series A Preferred Stock held by the Investor was issued on November 2, 2016, and as such, the Investor will be due such cumulative dividends beginning August 2, 2017. Pursuant to the terms of the Certificate of Designation of the Series A Preferred Stock, all accrued and accumulated dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock shall be paid prior and in preference to any cash dividend on our common stock. In addition, until the earlier of (i) such date as no Series A Preferred Stock remains outstanding and (ii) January 1, 2027, the Company is prohibited from paying any dividend on capital stock when there are accrued or unpaid dividends with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock.\nThe board may also suspend the payment of dividends on common stock at any time if it deems such action to be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. If we do not pay dividends, the price of our common stock must appreciate for investors to realize a gain on their investment. This appreciation may not occur and our stock may depreciate in value.\nOur ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent on cash flow generated by our subsidiaries because we are a holding company.\nWe are a holding company with no operations. Our subsidiaries own most of the assets that will generate income. Therefore, our ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, distribution or otherwise. Our subsidiaries may not be able or permitted to make distributions to enable us to make dividend payments in respect of our common stock. Each of our subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity, and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from them. In addition, any future financing or other arrangements that our subsidiaries enter into could limit their ability to make distributions to us. In addition, the Master Credit Agreement, as modified by the Modification Agreement, limits certain of our subsidiaries' ability to make distributions to us in the event of a default, or if the Company's\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nConsolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio falls below 1.25:1.00. In the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make dividend payments on our common stock.\nWe may engage in acquisitions that could harm our business, operating results or financial condition.\nA key component of our business strategy is to identify and acquire properties that are complementary to our core business. We frequently evaluate potential acquisitions and intend to actively pursue acquisition opportunities, some of which could be significant. We cannot make assurances that we will be able to successfully integrate and manage acquired properties and businesses and increase our profits from these operations.\nThe integration of acquired businesses may result in disruption to other parts of our business. In addition, the integration may require that we incur significant restructuring charges. To integrate acquired businesses, we must implement our management information systems, operating systems and internal controls, and assimilate and manage the personnel of the acquired operations. The difficulties of the integrations may be further complicated by such factors as geographic distances, lack of experience operating in the geographic market or industry sector of the acquired business, delays and challenges associated with integrating the business with our existing businesses, diversion of management's attention from daily operations of the business, potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business, the potential for deficiencies in internal controls at the acquired business, performance problems with the acquired business' technology, exposure to unanticipated liabilities of the acquired business, insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with the acquisition, and our ability to achieve the growth prospects and synergies expected from any such acquisition. Even when an acquired business has already developed and marketed products and services, there can be no assurance that product or service enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that all pre-acquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues that might arise with respect to such acquired assets.\nFuture acquisitions may also cause us to assume liabilities, record goodwill and intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing and potential impairment charges, incur amortization expense related to certain intangible assets and increase our expenses and working capital requirements, which would reduce our return on invested capital. Failure to manage and successfully integrate the acquisitions we make could materially harm our business and operating results.\nWe may be unsuccessful in identifying suitable acquisition candidates which may negatively impact our growth strategy.\nThere can be no assurance given that we will be able to identify additional suitable acquisition candidates or consummate future acquisitions or strategic transactions on acceptable terms. Our failure to successfully identify additional suitable acquisition candidates or consummate future acquisitions or strategic transactions on acceptable terms could have an adverse effect on our prospects, business activities, cash flow, financial condition, results of operations and stock price.\nIf we experience any service interruptions, data corruption, cyber or other security breaches, our operations could be disrupted.\n\ufeff\nWe rely on our information technology systems, which may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns as a result of, for example, failures during the process of upgrading or replacing technology, power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, computer hackers, telecommunication failures, user errors, or even catastrophic events. If our information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our business maybe disrupted, resulting in an inability to operate the effected resorts.\nWe also possess sensitive customer and employee information and may provide such data to third parties for analysis, benefit distribution or compliance purposes. While we believe we have taken reasonable and appropriate steps to protect that information, hackers and data thieves operate sophisticated, large-scale attacks that could breach our information systems, despite ongoing security measures. Consequently, a security breach could result in unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, we are required to comply with increasingly complex regulations designed to protect our business and personal data.\nAny breach of our network security, a third-party\u2019s network security or failure to comply with applicable regulations may result in (a) the loss of valuable business data and/or our customers\u2019 or employees\u2019 personal information, (b) increased costs to implement additional protections and processes, (c) a disruption of our business and a loss of revenue, (d) damage to\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nour relationships and reputation, and (e) fines or lawsuits. In addition, the costs related to cyber or other security threats or breaches may not be fully insured or indemnified.\nWe are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations in the ordinary course of business.\nOur operations are subject to a variety of federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to emissions to the air; discharges to water; storage, treatment and disposal of wastes; land use; remediation of contaminated sites; and protection of natural resources such as wetlands. For example, future expansions of certain of our ski facilities must comply with applicable forest plans approved under the National Forest Management Act or local zoning requirements. In addition, most projects to improve, upgrade or expand our ski resorts are subject to environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act. Both acts require that the U.S. Forest Service study any proposal for potential environmental impacts and include in its analysis various alternatives. Our ski resort improvement proposals may not be approved or may be approved with modifications that substantially increase the cost or decrease the desirability of implementing the project.\nOur facilities are subject to risks associated with mold and other indoor building contaminants. From time to time our operations are subject to inspections by environmental regulators or other regulatory agencies. We are also subject to worker health and safety requirements.\nWe believe our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable material environmental, health and safety requirements. However, our efforts to comply do not eliminate the risk that we may be held liable, incur fines or be subject to claims for damages, and that the amount of any liability, fines, damages or remediation costs may be material for, among other things, the presence or release of regulated materials at, on or emanating from properties we now own or lease and operate, or formerly owned, leased or operated, newly discovered environmental impacts or contamination at or from any of our properties, or changes in environmental laws and regulations or their enforcement.\nThe loss of our key executive officers could harm our business.\nOur success depends to a significant extent upon the performance and continued service of our key management team which includes Timothy Boyd, our President and principal executive officer, Stephen Mueller, our Vice President and principal financial officer, and Richard Deutsch, our Vice President in charge of business and real estate development. The loss of the services of this management team and the failure to develop and maintain an adequate succession plan could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations because of Messrs. Boyd's, Mueller's and Deutsch's specific and unique knowledge of acquiring and operating multiple ski resorts, including day ski resorts and overnight drive ski resorts.\nFailure to maintain the integrity of guest data could result in damage to our reputation and/or subject us to costs, fines or lawsuits.\nWe collect personally identifiable information relating to our guests for various business purposes, including marketing and promotional purposes. The integrity and privacy of our guests\u2019 information is important to us, and our guests have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information. The regulatory environment governing privacy laws is increasingly demanding, and privacy laws continue to evolve and, on occasion, may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. Maintaining compliance with applicable privacy regulations may increase our operating costs and/or adversely impact our ability to market our products, properties and services to our guests. Furthermore, non-compliance with applicable privacy regulations by us (or in some circumstances non-compliance by third parties engaged by us), a breach of security on systems storing our guest data, a loss of guest data or fraudulent use of guest data could adversely impact our reputation or result in fines or other damages and litigation.\nWe are subject to risks related to certain payment methods.\nWe accept payments using a variety of methods, including credit cards, debit cards and gift cards. As we offer new payment options to consumers, we may be subject to additional regulations, compliance requirements and fraud. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules and certification requirements, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult for us to comply. As our business changes, we may also\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nbe subject to different rules under existing standards, which may require new assessments that involve costs above what we currently pay for compliance. While we are currently in compliance with all applicable rules and certification requirements, we may be subject to fines, higher transaction fees or loss of or restrictions on our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from customers if we are not in compliance with new rules and regulations or if the volume of fraud in our transactions rises to certain levels. If any of these events were to occur, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business requires significant capital expenditures to both maintain and improve our ski resorts and expand our business through acquisitions. The lack of available funds for these capital expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our operating strategy.\nSustaining our successful financial performance depends, in part, on our ability to maintain and improve the quality of our facilities, products, and management resources (either directly or through third parties), which requires significant capital expenditures. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2017 were approximately $8.6 million. To the extent that we are unable to obtain the funds necessary to maintain and grow our business with cash generated from operating activities, or from borrowed funds or additional equity investments, our financial condition and results of operations could be affected. Although we believe that capital expenditures above maintenance levels can be deferred to address cash flow or other constraints, these expenditures cannot be deferred for extended periods without adversely affecting our competitive position and financial performance.\nHistorically, a key element of our strategy has been attracting additional skiers through investment in on-mountain capital improvements. These improvements are capital intensive, and a lack of available funds for capital expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our ability to implement our operating strategy. We intend to finance resort capital improvements through internally generated funds and proceeds from the offering of debt and equity. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available to fund these capital improvements or that these capital improvements will sustain our customer base, attract additional skiers or generate additional revenues.\nFuture acquisitions may require additional debt or equity financing, which in the case of debt financing, will increase our leverage and, in the case of equity financing, would be dilutive to our existing stockholders. Any decline in our perceived credit-worthiness associated with an acquisition could adversely affect our ability to borrow and result in more restrictive borrowing terms. As a result of the foregoing, we also may not be able to complete acquisitions or strategic transactions in the future to the same extent as in the past, or at all. These and other factors could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability at acquired operations or realize other anticipated benefits of an acquisition, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on significant infrastructure and equipment.\nOur infrastructure and equipment, including snowmaking equipment and ski lifts, are costly to maintain, repair and replace and are susceptible to unscheduled maintenance. Much of our infrastructure and equipment will eventually need to be replaced or significantly repaired or modernized, which could result in interruptions to our business, particularly during our peak periods. In certain cases, the cost of infrastructure or equipment repair or replacement may not be justified by the revenues at the applicable resort.\nThe high fixed cost structure of ski resort operations can result in significantly lower operating income if revenues decline.\nThe cost structure of ski resort operations has a significant fixed component with variable expenses including, but not limited to, resort related fees, credit card fees, retail/rental cost of sales and labor, ski school labor and dining operations. Any material declines in the economy, elevated geopolitical uncertainties and/or significant changes in historical snowfall patterns, as well as other risk factors discussed herein, could adversely affect revenue. As such, our operating income, profits and cash flows may be materially reduced due to declines in revenue given our relatively high fixed cost structure. In addition, increases in wages and other labor costs, energy, healthcare, insurance, transportation, fuel, and other expenses included in our fixed cost structure may also reduce our margins, profits and cash flows.\nWe generate a significant portion of our annual revenues from Mount Snow and Hunter Mountain. Conditions or events that could negatively impact Mount Snow or Hunter Mountain could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nRevenue generated from Mount Snow and Hunter Mountain in fiscal 2017 represented approximately 55.1% of our total fiscal 2017 revenues. Mount Snow and Hunter Mountain, like our other resorts, are subject to various risks such as those described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, including natural disasters, changes in consumer leisure tastes, competition from other area ski resorts, decreased water supply and regional weather. The occurrence of such events or conditions that negatively impact Mount Snow and Hunter Mountain would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nCancellation of or modifications to the Immigrant Investor Program, or our failure to successfully raise capital under the program's guidelines, could adversely affect our ability to execute our growth strategy and improve our resorts.\nWe intend to continue to fund our Mount Snow development by raising funds under the Immigrant Investor Program, referred to herein as the EB-5 Program, administered by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (\u201cUSCIS\u201d) pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act, as more fully discussed herein. This program was created to stimulate the U.S. economy through the creation of jobs and capital investments in U.S. companies by foreign investors. Congress has allocated 10,000 immigrant visas (\u2018\u2018EB-5 Visas\u2019\u2019) per year to qualified individuals seeking lawful permanent resident status on the basis of their investment in a new commercial enterprise that generates jobs.\nThe majority of EB-5 investors, and therefore EB-5 Visa recipients, are from China. Recently, the demand for the annual allocation of the EB-5 Visas has exceeded the supply, and nationals of China are now subject to lengthy waiting periods for such visas. These waiting periods could exceed five to ten years. Furthermore, raising funds pursuant to EB-5 Programs could become significantly more difficult if primary EB-5 investor markets in Asia are impacted by an economic downturn or military conflict, or if the United States government continues to subject EB-5 investor green card applicants to lengthy adjudications.\nIn addition, the EB-5 Program has been extended by Congress until September 30, 2017 for new programs. The continuity of the EB-5 Program is dependent on future action by lawmakers. For several years, the EB-5 Program has been extended for temporary periods only and not made permanent by Congress. Congress may continue to approve the EB-5 Program for only temporary periods and/or may materially modify aspects of the EB-5 Program that would make it unfeasible for the Company to rely on EB-5 financing for future development.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully raise additional sufficient funds under the EB-5 Program in order to implement future plans to improve our resorts. In this case, conventional financing options, such as loans, may prove too costly or may not be available, which could result in cancellation of our development and improvement plans and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe lease all or some of the land underlying certain of our resorts from third parties.\nWe lease some or all of our property at Paoli Peaks and Mad River from third parties. Our lease at Paoli Peaks terminates in 2078 and our lease at Mad River terminates in 2034. Combined, these resorts contributed 5.4% of our total revenues for the year ended April 30, 2017. A termination of any of these leases could negatively impact our results of operations.\nA substantial portion of the skiable terrain at certain of our resorts is used under the terms of Forest Service permits.\nA substantial portion of the skiable terrain at our Attitash and Mount Snow resorts and all of the land underlying the Wildcat Mountain resort is federal land that is used under the terms of permits with the U.S. Forest Service. The permits give the U.S. Forest Service the right to review and comment on the location, design, and construction of improvements in the permit area and on certain other operational matters. The permits can also be terminated or modified by the U.S. Forest Service for specific compelling reasons or in the event we fail to perform any of our obligations under the permits. Otherwise, the permits may be renewed. A termination or modification of any of our permits could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Currently, our permits expire as follows:\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\ufeff\nWe rely on information technology to operate our businesses and maintain our competitiveness, and any failure to adapt to technological developments or industry trends could harm our business.\nWe depend on the use of information technology and systems, including technology and systems used for central reservations, point of sale, procurement and administration. We must continuously improve and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to offer enhanced products, services, features and functionality, while maintaining the reliability and integrity of our systems and infrastructure. Our future success also depends on our ability to adapt our infrastructure to meet rapidly evolving consumer trends and demands and to respond to competitive service and product offerings.\nIn addition, we may not be able to maintain our existing systems or replace or introduce new technologies and systems as quickly as we would like or in a cost-effective manner. Delays or difficulties in implementing new or enhanced systems may keep us from achieving the desired results in a timely manner, to the extent anticipated, or at all. Any interruptions, outages or delays in our systems, or deterioration in their performance, could impair our ability to process transactions and could decrease our quality of service that we offer to our guests. Also, we may be unable to devote financial resources to new technologies and systems in the future. If any of these events occur, our business and financial performance could suffer.\nWe currently rely on one lender and its affiliates as a source for the majority of our financing and credit.\nWe have historically relied on one lender and its affiliates, EPR, for substantially all of our financing and credit needs, including financing relating to our resort acquisitions. EPR is an entertainment, entertainment-related, recreation and specialty real estate company with its common stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \"EPR\". In the event EPR is not available to extend us credit, we may not be able to obtain financing on terms as favorable to us as those under our arrangements with EPR. As a result, we may be subject to more stringent financial covenants and higher interest rates.\nWe depend on a seasonal workforce.\nOur mountain and lodging operations are highly dependent on a large seasonal workforce. We recruit year-round to fill thousands of seasonal staffing needs each season and work to manage seasonal wages and the timing of the hiring process to ensure the appropriate workforce is in place. We cannot guarantee that material increases in the cost of securing our seasonal workforce will not be necessary in the future. Furthermore, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to recruit and hire adequate seasonal personnel as the business requires. Increased seasonal wages or an inadequate workforce could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe are subject to litigation in the ordinary course of business because of the nature of our business.\nThe safety of guests and employees is a major concern and focus for all managers and employees of the Company. By the nature of our activities, we are exposed to the risk that guests or employees may be involved in accidents during the use, operation or maintenance of ski lifts, rides and other resort facilities. As a result, we are, from time to time, subject to various asserted or unasserted legal proceedings and claims. Any such claims, regardless of merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to defend and could divert management's attention and resources. While we believe we have adequate insurance coverage and/or accrue for loss contingencies for all known matters that are probable and can be reasonably estimated, we cannot assure that the outcome of all current or future litigation will not have a material adverse effect on us and our results of operations.\nIf we fail to manage future growth effectively, our business could be harmed.\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, rapid growth. This growth has placed significant demands on our management, operational and financial infrastructure. To manage growth effectively, we must continue to improve and enhance our managerial, operational and financial controls, train and manage our employees, and expand our employee base. We must also manage new and existing relationships with vendors, business partners and other third parties. These activities will require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable management resources. If we fail to maintain the efficiency of our organization as we grow, our profit margins may decrease, and we may be unable to achieve our business objectives.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nA disruption in our water supply would impact our snowmaking capabilities and impact our operations.\nOur operations are heavily dependent upon our access to adequate supplies of water with which to make snow and otherwise conduct our operations. Our resorts in New Hampshire and Vermont are subject to state laws and regulations regarding our use of water. There can be no assurance that applicable laws and regulations will not change in a manner that could have an adverse effect on our operations, or that important permits, licenses, or agreements will not be canceled or will be renewed on terms as favorable as the current terms. Any failure to have access to adequate water supplies to support our current operations and anticipated expansion would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nEPR has an option to purchase, or assume our leases relating to, certain of our ski resorts. If EPR exercises this option, we would incur significant tax obligations.\nOn December 1, 2014, in connection with the Debt Restructure, we entered into an Option Agreement with EPT Ski Properties, Inc. providing EPR a purchase option on the Boston Mills, Brandywine, Jack Frost, Big Boulder and Alpine Valley ski resorts. The Option Agreement provides that the purchase option will be exercisable as to any one or more of such properties on the maturity date of the applicable promissory notes for such properties upon (i) proper notice by EPR and (ii) payment of a purchase price for each such property calculated in accordance with the Option Agreement. Upon the closing of any sale under the option, EPR will enter into an agreement with the Company or one of its subsidiaries for the lease of each such acquired property for an initial term of 20 years, plus options to extend the lease for two additional periods of 10 years each.\nOver the years, we have depreciated the value of these properties pursuant to applicable accounting rules, and as such, we have a low adjusted tax basis in the properties. As a result, we will realize significant taxable gains on the sale of the properties to EPT Ski Properties, Inc. if the option is exercised. We may be required to pay income taxes on the taxable gains from such sale, which we expect to be a substantial cost.\nUnder certain circumstances, our insurance coverage may not cover all possible losses, and we may not be able to renew our insurance policies on favorable terms, or at all.\nAlthough we maintain various property and casualty insurance policies, our insurance policies do not cover all types of losses and liabilities and in some cases may not be sufficient to cover the ultimate cost of claims which exceed policy limits. If we are held liable for amounts exceeding the limits of our insurance coverage or for claims outside the scope of our coverage, our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, we may not be able to renew our current insurance policies on favorable terms, or at all. Our ability to obtain future insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates could be materially adversely affected if we or other companies within or outside our industry sustain significant losses or make significant insurance claims.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our workforce.\nWe are subject to various federal and state laws governing matters such as minimum wage requirements, overtime compensation and other working conditions, discrimination and family and medical leave. In addition, we are continuing to assess the impact of U.S. federal healthcare reform law and regulations on our healthcare benefit costs, which will likely increase the amount of healthcare expenses paid by us. Immigration law reform could also impact our workforce because we recruit and hire foreign nationals as part of our seasonal workforce. If our labor-related expenses increase, our operating expenses could increase and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nWe are structured as a holding company and have no assets other than the common stock of our subsidiaries.\nWe are a holding company and we do not currently have any material assets other than the common stock we own in our direct and indirect subsidiaries. Our working capital needs are dependent, in part, upon the receipt of dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries. Certain laws may restrict or limit such payments to us by our subsidiaries, in which case we may need to seek other sources of funding.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nA natural disaster could damage our property and reduce the number of guests who visit our resorts.\nA severe natural disaster, such as a forest fire, flood or landslide, may interrupt our operations, damage our properties and reduce the number of guests who visit our resorts in affected areas. Damage to our properties could take a long time to repair and there is no guarantee that we would have adequate insurance to cover the costs of repair or the expense of the interruption to our business. Furthermore, such a disaster may interrupt or impede access to our affected properties or require evacuations and may cause visits to our affected properties to decrease for an indefinite period. The ability to attract visitors to our resorts is also influenced by the aesthetics and natural beauty of the outdoor environment where our resorts are located. A severe forest fire or other severe impacts from naturally occurring events could negatively impact the natural beauty of our resorts and have a long-term negative impact on our overall guest visitation as it would take several years for the environment to recover.\nWe will not be required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to have our independent registered public accounting firm formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls while we qualify as an \"emerging growth company.\" If we are unable to establish and maintain effective internal controls, or those controls are not identified during management review of our internal controls, our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nIn fiscal year 2016, management hired a consulting firm to assist us in our evaluation and implementation of an internal control structure to comply with the SEC rules for implementing Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Company continued working with our consultant in fiscal year 2017. We, as management, are required to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting for that purpose. Our independent registered public accounting firm, however, is not required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until we are no longer an \"emerging growth company\" as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startup Act of 2012 (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d). At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented, designed or operating. Further, we may take advantage of other accounting and disclosure related exemptions afforded to \"emerging growth companies\" from time to time. If we are unable to establish and maintain effective internal controls, our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nClimate change and greenhouse effects may adversely impact our results of operations.\nThere is a growing political and scientific consensus that emissions of greenhouse gases continue to alter the composition of the global atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue affecting the global climate. The effects of climate change, including any impact of global warming, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWarmer overall temperatures would likely adversely affect skier visits and our revenue and profits. As noted above, warm weather may result in inadequate natural snowfall and render snowmaking wholly or partially ineffective in maintaining quality skiing conditions. In addition, a steady increase in global temperatures could shorten the ski season in the future.\nPhysical risks from climate change may also include an increase in changes to precipitation and extreme weather events in ways we cannot currently predict. Such changes to the amount of natural snowfall and extreme differences in weather patterns may increase our snowmaking expense, inhibit our snowmaking capabilities and negatively impact skier perceptions of the ski season.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe issuance of shares of our Series A Preferred Stock reduces the relative voting power of holders of our common stock, may dilute the ownership of such holders and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nAs holders of our Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, on an as-converted basis, together with holders of our common stock on all matters submitted to a vote of the holders of our common stock, the issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock effectively reduces the relative voting power of the holders of our common stock. Current stockholders (other than the Investor) will have no preemptive rights to purchase any shares of Series A Preferred Stock and/or Warrants,\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nwhich means that current stockholders do not have a prior right to purchase any issue of Series A Preferred Stock and/or Warrants in order to maintain their proportionate interest in the Company.\nIn addition, the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock to common stock would dilute the ownership interest of existing holders of our common stock, and any sales in the public market, following registration pursuant to the registration rights granted to the Investor, of the common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock and/or exercise of the Warrants could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. Sales by such holders of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales might occur, could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nThe holders of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock may exercise significant influence over us.\nThe Investor and its affiliates currently own approximately 10.0% of our shares of common stock and, assuming the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock and exercise of the Warrants, would own 36.7% of our shares of common stock. Additional pre-emptive rights and rights of first offer in the documents governing the Private Placement help the Investor to maintain its ownership position. Holders of our Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote, on an as-converted basis, together with holders of our common stock on all matters submitted to a vote of the holders of our common stock. As a result, the holders of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock have the ability to significantly influence the outcome of any matter submitted for the vote of the holders of our common stock.\nIn addition, under the terms of the Certificate of Designation governing the Series A Preferred Stock, the Series A Preferred Stock generally ranks, with respect to the liquidation, dividends and redemption, senior to other securities until the earlier of (i) such date as no Series A Preferred Stock remains outstanding and (ii) January 1, 2027. The Stockholders\u2019 Agreement executed by the Company, the Investor and the management stockholders in connection with the closing of the Private Placement also requires, that, so long as the Investor beneficially owns, on an as-converted basis, at least 11.4% of the outstanding equity securities of the Company, the Investor\u2019s approval is required in order for the Company or any subsidiary to (i) materially change the nature of its business from owning, operating and managing ski resorts or (ii) acquire or dispose of any resorts, assets or properties for aggregate consideration equal to or greater than 30% of the enterprise value of the Company and its subsidiaries, or (iii) agree to do any of the foregoing.\nLast, the Stockholders\u2019 Agreement grants to the Investor the right to nominate a director so long as it beneficially owns, on an as-converted basis, at least 20% of the outstanding equity securities of the Company, subject to satisfaction of reasonable qualification standards and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee approval of the nominee. Notwithstanding the fact that all directors will be subject to fiduciary duties to us and to applicable law, the interests of the directors designated by the Investor may differ from the interests of our security holders as a whole or of our other directors.\nOur Series A Preferred Stock has rights, preferences and privileges that are not held by, and are preferential to, the rights of our common stockholders, which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, and may result in the interests of the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock differing from those of our common stockholders.\nThe holders of Series A Preferred Stock have the right to receive a liquidation preference entitling them to be paid out of our assets available for distribution to stockholders before any payment may be made to holders of any other class or series of capital stock as well as a preferential right to receive cumulative dividends at the rate of 8% per annum on the Liquidation Value of $1,000 per share. The holders of our Series A Preferred Stock also have certain redemption and conversion rights, and there are limitations on the Company\u2019s ability to redeem other securities.\nThese dividend obligations could impact our liquidity and reduce the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, growth opportunities, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes. Our obligations to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock could also limit our ability to obtain additional financing or increase our borrowing costs, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. The preferential rights could also result in divergent interests between the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock and holders of our common stock.\nProvisions in our amended and restated articles of incorporation, our amended and restated bylaws and Missouri law might discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our common stock.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nProvisions of our amended and restated articles of incorporation approved by stockholders in connection with the Private Placement, our amended and restated bylaws and Missouri law might discourage, delay, or prevent a merger, acquisition, or other change in control that stockholders consider favorable, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for shares of our common stock. These provisions might also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management. These provisions include:\n\u00b7\nThe additional authorized shares of common stock and preferred stock could be used to dilute the stock ownership or voting rights of persons seeking to obtain control of us or could be issued to persons allied with the board of directors or management and thereby have the effect of making it more difficult to remove directors or members of management by diluting the stock ownership or voting rights of persons seeking to effect such a removal.\n\u00b7\nThe blank check preferred stock could be used by the board of directors for adoption of a stockholder rights plan or \u201cpoison pill.\u201d\n\u00b7\nExisting provisions of our governing documents, including the limitations on director removal, the threshold vote required for stockholders to call a special meeting of the stockholders or act by written consent, the advance notice required for stockholder proposals and director nominations, the limitations on the increase in the number of directors and the inability of stockholders to amend the bylaws, may have anti-takeover effects.\n\u00b7\nSimilarly, applicable provisions of Missouri law, such as the business combination and control share acquisition statutes, may have anti-takeover effects, making it more difficult for or preventing a third party from acquiring control of us or changing our board of directors and management. These provisions may also have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying changes in control of us or in our management.\nThe existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of the Company, thereby reducing the likelihood that our stockholders could receive a premium for our common stock in an acquisition.\nThe board of directors does not believe that the issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Warrants and the common stock issuable upon conversion or exercise thereof will have a significant impact on any attempt to gain control of the Company. It is possible, however, that the existence of a single stockholder with a significant ownership percentage and director nomination rights could discourage third parties from attempting to gain control. It should be noted that any action taken by the Company to discourage an attempt to acquire control of the Company might result in stockholders not being able to participate in any possible premiums which might be obtained in the absence of anti-takeover provisions. Any transaction which may be so discouraged or avoided could be a transaction that the Company's stockholders might consider to be in their best interests. However, the board of directors has a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the Company's stockholders at all times.\nIn addition, pursuant to each of the Executive Employment Agreements dated effective as of June 1, 2014 between the Company each of Messrs. Boyd, Mueller and Deutsch (each, an \"Executive\"), each Executive is entitled to change of control payments in the event of a termination of Executive's employment by the Company without cause or notice by the Company of non-renewal of the agreement, all within 365 days of a consummation of a change in control of the Company. A \u201cchange in control\u201d includes an event or series of events by which any person or group becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 35% or more of the equity securities of the Company entitled to vote for members of the board of directors or equivalent governing body of the Company on a fully-diluted basis. Upon the exercise of Warrants to purchase additional shares of common stock, the Investor may become the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 36.4% or more of the equity securities of the Company entitled to vote for members of the board of directors, thereby triggering the change in control provisions in the Executive Employment Agreements.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. In addition to the factors discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K, factors that could cause fluctuations in the market price of our common stock include the following:\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u00b7\nquarterly variations in our results of operations;\n\u00b7\nresults of operations that vary from those of our competitors;\n\u00b7\nchanges in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors;\n\u00b7\nannouncements by us, our competitors or our vendors of significant contracts, acquisitions, joint marketing relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u00b7\nannouncements by third parties of significant claims or proceedings against us;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in trading volume;\n\u00b7\nfuture sales of our common stock; and\n\u00b7\nchanges in investor sentiment toward the stock of ski resort and recreational services companies in general.\nFurthermore, the stock market has experienced extreme volatility that in some cases has been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nIn the past, following periods of market volatility, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation. If we were involved in securities litigation, it could be a substantial cost and divert resources and the attention of executive management from our business regardless of the outcome of such litigation.\nRequirements associated with being a public company will increase our costs, as well as divert Company resources and management's attention, particularly after we are no longer an \"emerging growth company,\" and may affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members and executive officers.\nAs a public company, we are required to comply with the SEC's rules implementing Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires our management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We are required to make our first assessment of our internal control over financial reporting in fiscal 2016. Our independent registered public accounting firm, however, will not be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting so long as we qualify as an emerging growth company.\nWe are working with our legal, independent accounting, and financial advisors to identify those areas in which changes or enhancements should be made to our financial and management control systems to manage our growth and obligations as a public company. Some such areas include corporate governance, corporate control, internal audit, disclosure controls and procedures, and financial reporting and accounting systems. We have made, and will continue to make, changes in these and other areas. However, the expenses that will be required in order to function adequately as a public company could be material.\nCompliance with the various reporting and other requirements applicable to public companies will also require considerable time and attention of management. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of the additional costs we may incur, the timing of such costs or the impact that our management's attention to these matters will have on our business. In addition, the changes we make may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations as a public company on a timely basis or at all.\nIn addition, being a public company could make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including directors' and officers' liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees and our executive team.\nOur principal stockholders may exert substantial influence over us and may exercise their control in a manner adverse to your interests.\nTimothy D. Boyd, Stephen J. Mueller and Richard K. Deutsch, three named executive officers, own approximately 16% of our outstanding common stock. Furthermore, as the holder of our Series A Preferred Stock, the Investor is entitled to vote, on an as-converted basis, together with holders of our common stock on all matters submitted to a vote of the common stockholders. On an as-converted basis, the Investor would own approximately 36.7% of the common stock. As a result, the management stockholders together with the Investor will be able to exercise a significant level of control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, amendment of our amended and restated articles of incorporation and approval of significant corporate transactions. This ability could have the effect of delaying or preventing a\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nchange of control of the Company or changes in management and will make the approval of certain transactions difficult or impossible without the support of these stockholders. It is possible that these persons will exercise control over us in a manner adverse to your interests.\nWe are an \"emerging growth company\" with reduced reporting requirements that may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \"emerging growth company,\" as defined in the JOBS Act, and may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to public companies generally. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we may elect not to have our independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as would otherwise be required by Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This may increase the risk that we fail to detect and remedy any weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting.\nIn general, these reduced reporting requirements may allow us to refrain from disclosing information that you may find important. It is also possible that investors may generally find our common stock less attractive because of our status as an emerging growth company and our more limited disclosure. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect the price and liquidity of our common stock.\nWe may take advantage of these disclosure exemptions until we are no longer an \"emerging growth company.\" We could be an emerging growth company until the last day of the fiscal year in which the Company celebrates the fifth anniversary of its first sale of registered common equity securities, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier if our annual revenues exceed $1.0 billion, if we issue more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt in any three-year period or if we become a \"large accelerated filer\" as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act.\nFuture sales of our common stock may cause our stock price to decline.\nIf our existing stockholders sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decline. These sales might also make it more difficult for us to sell additional equity securities at a time and price that we deem appropriate. All of the shares of our common stock sold in our initial public offering are freely tradable in the public market, except for any shares held by our affiliates as defined in Rule 144 of the Securities Act.\nWe also registered all 559,296 shares of common stock that we may issue under the Peak Resorts, Inc. 2014 Equity Incentive Plan that has been adopted by the board of directors and stockholders. These shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to vesting conditions. As of April 30, 2017, 463,842 shares remained available for issuance.\n\ufeff", "PERMNO": 15080, "SIC": 7990, "TIC": "SKIS"}
