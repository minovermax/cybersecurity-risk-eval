RISK FACTORS\nThis report includes \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (\u201cSecurities Act\u201d), and Section 21E of the Exchange Act, including, in particular, forward-looking statements under the headings \u201cItem 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and \u201cItem 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d These statements appear in a number of places in this report and include statements regarding the Company\u2019s intent, belief or current expectations, such as those relating to future business, future results of operations or financial condition, new or planned products or services, or management strategies, including those with respect to (i) the Company\u2019s financing plans, (ii) trends affecting its financial condition or results of operations and (iii) the impact of competition. The words \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cseek,\u201d \u201cestimate\u201d and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements; however, this report also contains other forward-looking statements in addition to historical information.\nThese forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, among others, those discussed in \u201cItem 1A - Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as in our consolidated financial statements, related notes, and the other information appearing elsewhere in this report and our other filings with the SEC. We do not intend, and undertake no obligation, to update any of our forward-looking statements after the date of this report to reflect actual results or future events or circumstances. Given these risks and uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.\nFactors that could cause the actual results of the Company in future periods to differ materially include, but are not limited to, the following:\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nFuture cash flows from operations or through financings may not be sufficient to enable the Company to meet its obligations, and this would likely have a material adverse effect on its businesses, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to meet its cash requirements to fund its activities in the ordinary course of business is dependent, in part, upon its ability to access cash from the senior revolving credit facility (the \u201c2012 Credit Facility\u201d), and also on the Company\u2019s continuing ability to materially meet its business plans. There can be no assurance that the funds available from operations and under the Company\u2019s credit facility will be sufficient to fund its debt service costs, working capital demands, environmental remediation costs or any of the Company\u2019s other existing or future obligations. As of December 31, 2015, availability under the Company\u2019s senior revolving credit facility was $26,044,000 and as of March 6, 2016, it was $29,069,000.\nThere can be no assurances that the Company will continue to have access to its lines of credit if the financial performance of its subsidiaries does not satisfy the financial covenants set forth in the applicable financing agreements. If the Company does not meet certain of its financial covenants, and if it is unable to secure necessary waivers or other amendments from the respective lenders on terms acceptable to management, its ability to access available lines of credit could be limited, its debt obligations could be accelerated by the respective lenders, liquidity could be adversely affected and the Company might not be able to meet its financial obligations.\nIf the Company\u2019s cash needs are significantly greater than anticipated or the Company does not materially meet its business plans, the Company may be required to seek additional or alternative financing sources. There can be no assurance that such financing will be available or available on terms acceptable to the Company. The Company\u2019s inability to generate sufficient cash flows from its operations or through financing could impair its liquidity and would likely have a material adverse effect on its businesses, financial condition and results of operations.\nCredit market volatility may affect our ability to refinance our existing debt, borrow funds under our existing lines of credit or incur additional debt.\nThe Company\u2019s 2012 Credit Facility is due to expire on August 9, 2016. In the recent past, the global capital and credit markets experienced a period of unprecedented volatility. Future disruption and volatility in credit market conditions could have a material adverse impact on our ability to refinance our debt when it comes due on terms similar to our current credit facilities, or to draw upon our existing lines of credit or incur additional debt if needed as a result of unanticipated downturns in the markets for our products and services, which may require us to seek other funding sources to meet our cash requirements. We cannot be certain that alternative sources of financing would be available to the Company in the future on terms and conditions acceptable to us, or at all.\nEconomic downturns could disrupt and materially harm our business.\nNegative trends in the general economy could cause a downturn in the market for our products and services. A significant portion of our revenues are received from customers in medical, commercial and military aerospace, defense and industrial related industries, which have experienced financial downturns in the past. Demand for these industries\u2019 products tends to fluctuate due to changes in national and global economic conditions, availability of credit and other factors. A worsening of consumer demand in these industries would adversely affect our revenues, profitability, operating results and cash flows. We may also experience a slowdown if some customers experience difficulty in obtaining adequate financing due to tightness in the credit markets. Furthermore, the financial stability of our customers or suppliers may be compromised, which could result in additional bad debts for us or non-performance by suppliers. Our assets may also be impaired or subject to write-down or write-off as a result of these conditions. These adverse effects would likely be exacerbated if global economic conditions worsen, resulting in wide-ranging, adverse and prolonged effects on general business conditions, and materially and adversely affect our operations, financial results and liquidity.\nIn many cases, our competitors are larger than us and have manufacturing and financial resources greater than we do, which may have a negative impact on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nIn our served markets, we compete against domestic and foreign public and private companies that manufacture products of the type we manufacture. Some of these competitors are larger than we are and have financial resources greater than we do. This results in robust competition in a number of markets in which we operate. Some of these competitors enjoy certain other competitive advantages, including greater name recognition, greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources, a larger installed base of customers, and well-established relationships with current and potential customers. Competition is based on quality, technology, service, and price, and in some industries, new product introduction. We may not be able to compete successfully, and competition may have a negative impact on our business, operating results or financial condition by reducing volume of products sold and/or selling prices, and accordingly reducing our sales and profits.\nOur sales and profitability may be adversely affected by fluctuations in the cost and supply of raw materials and commodities.\nIn our production and distribution processes, we consume significant amounts of copper, steel and certain other non-ferrous metals used as raw materials. The availability and pricing of these raw materials are subject to market forces that are beyond our control. Our suppliers contract separately for the purchase of such raw materials, and our sources of supply could be interrupted should our suppliers not be able to obtain these materials due to higher demand or other factors interrupting their availability. Our results of operations may be adversely affected during periods in which either the prices of such raw materials are unusually high, or their availability is restricted, or if we are unable to pass through the unfavorable impact of raw material price fluctuations to our customers, including any change associated with the margins we generate from the material portion of our products. In the past we have enter into forward purchase agreements with suppliers for copper purchases in an attempt to mitigate the economic risk of these price fluctuations, however, the Company\u2019s strategy is designed to protect it against normal volatility; therefore, abnormal price changes in copper could negatively impact the Company\u2019s earnings.\nWe do not have long-term contracts with all of our customers, the loss of which could materially adversely affect our financial condition, business and results of operations.\nOur businesses are based primarily upon individual orders and sales with our customers rather than long-term supply contracts. As such, our customers could cease buying products at any time and for any reason, and we will have no recourse in the event a customer no longer wants to purchase products from us. If a significant number of our customers elect not to purchase products, it could materially adversely affect our financial condition, business and results of operations. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company\u2019s consolidated net sales in 2015. However, the Company\u2019s 15 largest customers accounted for approximately 41% of consolidated net sales in 2015. If we were to lose our relationship with several of these customers, revenues and profitability could fall significantly.\nSome of our businesses are subject to certain risks associated with the movement of businesses offshore.\nSome of our businesses are potentially at risk of losing business to competitors operating in lower cost countries. An additional risk is the movement offshore of some of our businesses\u2019 customers, leading them to procure products from more closely located companies. Either of these factors could negatively impact our financial condition, business and results of operations.\nOur business strategy includes acquisitions, and acquisitions entail numerous risks, including the risk of management diversion and increased costs and expenses, all of which could negatively affect the Company\u2019s profitability.\nOur business strategy includes, among other things, strategic acquisitions, as well as potential opportunistic acquisitions. This element of our strategy entails several risks, including the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns and the need to finance such acquisitions with additional debt.\nIn addition, once completed, acquisitions entail further risks, including: unanticipated costs and liabilities of the acquired businesses, including environmental liabilities that could materially adversely affect our results of operations; difficulties in assimilating acquired businesses; negative effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers; losing key employees of the acquired businesses; unanticipated difficulties integrating ERP systems and other infrastructures; unanticipated effects on our internal controls and on our compliance efforts with regulatory requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. If our acquisition strategy is not successful or if acquisitions are not well integrated into our existing operations, the Company\u2019s profitability could be negatively affected.\nDivestitures could negatively impact our business, and contingent liabilities from businesses that we have sold could adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plans or are not achieving the desired return on investment. Divestitures pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business. For example, when we decide to sell a business or assets, we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms and within our anticipated timeframe, and even after reaching a definitive agreement to sell a business, the sale is typically subject to satisfaction of pre-closing conditions, which may not become satisfied. In addition, divestitures may dilute the Company\u2019s earnings per share, have other adverse accounting impacts and distract management, and disputes may arise with buyers. In addition, the Company\u2019s sale of RFL triggered certain requirements of ISRA, which applies to New Jersey statutorily defined transactions involving industrial establishments. Under the RFL-SPA, the Company agreed to undertake, or cause to undertake, all actions necessary to comply with ISRA arising from the RFL-SPA.\nOur competitive advantage could be reduced if our intellectual property or related proprietary manufacturing processes become known by our competitors or if technological changes reduce our customers\u2019 need for our products.\nWe own a number of trademarks and patents in the United States and other jurisdictions on our products and related proprietary manufacturing processes. In addition to trademark and patent protection, we rely on trade secrets, proprietary know-how and technological advances that we seek to protect. If our intellectual property is not properly protected by us or is independently discovered by others or otherwise becomes known or if technological changes reduce our customers\u2019 need for our proprietary products, our protection against competitive products could be diminished, and our profitability could be substantially impaired.\nWe could incur significant costs, including remediation costs, as a result of complying with environmental laws.\nOur facilities and operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations imposed by federal, state, foreign and local authorities relating to the protection of the environment. We could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines or sanctions, and third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws. We have incurred, and in the future may continue to incur, liability under environmental statutes and regulations with respect to the contamination detected at sites owned or operated by the Company (including contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites, abutters or other persons) and the sites at which we have disposed of hazardous substances. As of December 31, 2015, we have established a reserve totaling $8,636,000 with respect to certain presently estimated environmental remediation costs. This reserve may not be adequate to cover the ultimate costs of remediation, including discovery of additional contaminants or the imposition of additional cleanup obligations, which could result in significant additional costs. In addition, we expect that future regulations, and changes in the text or interpretation of existing regulations, may subject us to increasingly stringent standards. Compliance with such requirements may make it necessary for us to retrofit existing facilities with additional pollution-control equipment, undertake new measures in connection with the storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of by-products and wastes or take other steps, which may be at a substantial cost to us.\nOur future success depends greatly upon attracting and retaining qualified personnel, which could increase our labor costs and impair our profitability.\nA significant factor in our future profitability is our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified personnel. Our success in attracting qualified personnel is affected by changing demographics of the available pool of workers with the training and skills necessary to fill available positions, the impact on the labor supply due to general economic conditions, and our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefit packages.\nIf we suffer loss to our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems or information technology systems due to catastrophe or other events, our operations could be seriously harmed.\nOur facilities, supply chains, distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, earthquake, hurricane, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters. If any of these facilities, supply chains or systems were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in defective products or services, damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal exposure and large repair or replacement expenses. The third-party insurance coverage that we maintain with respect to these and other risks will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on cost, availability and our decisions regarding risk retention, and may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against losses.\nA significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities. We also collect and store sensitive data, including confidential business information and personal data. These systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by computer hackers, computer viruses, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication or utility failures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events. In addition, security breaches of our systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees, customers or suppliers. Any such events could disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in defective products or services, damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or penalties under privacy laws, each of which could adversely affect our business and our financial condition.\nLitigation or compliance failures could adversely affect our profitability.\nThe nature of our businesses expose us to various litigation matters, including product liability claims, employment, health and safety matters, intellectual property infringement claims, environmental matters, regulatory and administrative proceedings, commercial disputes, or acquisition or divestiture-related matters. We contest these matters vigorously and make insurance claims where appropriate. However, litigation is inherently costly and unpredictable, making it difficult to accurately estimate the outcome of any litigation. These lawsuits may include claims for compensatory damages, punitive and consequential damages and/or injunctive relief. The defense of these lawsuits may divert our management\u2019s attention, we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits, and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. Moreover, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against such losses. In addition, developments in legal proceedings in any given period may require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our consolidated financial statements, record estimates or reserves for liabilities or assets previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates or pay cash settlements or judgments. Any of these developments could adversely affect our financial condition in any particular period. Although we make accruals as we believe warranted, the amounts that we accrue could vary significantly from any amounts we actually pay due to the inherent uncertainties in the estimation process. As of December 31, 2015, we have accrued approximately $8,636,000 for environmental remediation costs but have not made any accruals for other litigation matters.\nOur businesses are subject to extensive regulation; failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our financial condition and reputation.\nOur businesses are subject to extensive regulation by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental and self-regulatory entities at the federal, state and local levels, including laws related to anti-corruption, environmental matters, health and safety, import laws and export control and economic sanctions, and the sale of products and services to government entities.\nIn addition, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo (\u201cDRC\u201d) and adjoining countries. As a result, the SEC has adopted annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use conflict minerals mined from the DRC and adjoining countries in their products. The implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products. As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering \u201cconflict free\u201d conflict minerals, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary conflict minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we may implement.\nThese are not the only regulations that our businesses must comply with. Failure to comply with these or any other regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, damage to our reputation, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to manufacture, import, export and sell products and services, disbarment from selling to certain federal agencies, damage to our reputation and loss of customers and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. Compliance with these and other regulations may also require us to incur significant expenses. Our products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and failure to comply with these rules could result in withdrawal of certifications needed to sell our products and services and otherwise adversely impact our financial condition.\nOur internal controls over financial reporting may not be effective, and our independent auditors may not be able to certify as to their effectiveness, which could have a significant and adverse effect on our business and reputation.\nWe are subject to the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder (\u201cSection 404\u201d). Section 404 requires us to report on the design and effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. Section 404 also requires an independent registered public accounting firm to test our internal controls over financial reporting and report on the effectiveness of such controls. There can be no assurance that our auditors will issue an unqualified report attesting to our internal controls over financial reporting. As a result, there could be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our consolidated financial statements or our consolidated financial statements could change. Any failure to maintain or implement new or improved controls, or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation, could result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses, and cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations, or result in material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements. We may also be required to incur costs to improve our internal control system and hire additional personnel. This could negatively impact our results of operations.\nRisk Relating to Our Ownership Structure\nCertain members of our Board of Directors are affiliated with the largest shareholder of the Company.\nSteel Partners Holdings L.P. (\u201cSteel\u201d) owns directly or indirectly through its subsidiaries approximately 995,000 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, representing approximately 25.1% of the outstanding shares at December 31, 2015. Steel may increase its ownership position in the Company\u2019s common stock in the future. Warren G. Lichtenstein, a member of our Board of Directors, is also the Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors of the general partner of Steel (the \u201cSteel Board\u201d). The Steel Board has investment and voting control over the shares owned by Steel and thus has the ability to exert significant influence over our policies and affairs and over the outcome of any action requiring a stockholder vote, including the election of our Board of Directors, the approval of amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, and the approval of mergers or sales of substantially all of our assets. The interests of Mr. Lichtenstein and the other members of the Steel Board in such matters may differ from the interests of our other stockholders in some respects. In addition, our Chairman of the Board, Glen M. Kassan, is also affiliated with Steel.\nFactors Affecting the Value of Our Common Stock\nWe have received a non-binding proposal to acquire all the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company.\nOn February 5, 2016, our Special Committee, which consists of independent members of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors (\u201cSpecial Committee\u201d), received a revised non-binding proposal from Handy & Harman Ltd. (\u201cH&H\u201d), a publicly-traded NASDAQ company and an affiliate of Steel, to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company. Under the terms of the revised proposal, H&H proposed to pay $35.50 per share in an all cash transaction. The Special Committee is reviewing and considering the proposal carefully in due course, consistent with its fiduciary duties to act in the best interest of the Company\u2019s stockholders. There is no assurance that the Special Committee will recommend any transaction, or that any such transaction will be consummated. It is unknown when the Special Committee will make a decision regarding this proposal. In addition, it is uncertain how the Special Committee\u2019s decision, when made, will impact the market price for our common stock, which may react negatively.\nWe do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, which may limit investor demand.\nWe do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Such lack of dividend prospects may have an adverse impact on the market demand for our common stock as certain institutional investors may invest only in dividend-paying equity securities or may operate under other restrictions that may prohibit or limit their ability to invest in our common stock.\nFuture offerings of our equity securities may result in dilution of our common stock and a reduction in the price of our common stock.\nWe are authorized to issue 25,000,000 shares of common stock and 6,000,000 shares of preferred stock. On March 6, 2016, 3,961,000 shares of common stock were outstanding. Our Board of Directors may elect to issue shares of common stock or preferred stock in the future to raise capital or for other financial needs. Any future issuances of equity may be at prices below the market price of our stock, and our stockholders may suffer significant dilution, and the terms of any preferred stock issuance may adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders.", "PERMNO": 41320, "SIC": 3620, "TIC": "SLI"}
