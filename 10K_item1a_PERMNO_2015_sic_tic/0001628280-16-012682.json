{"cik": "1087294", "company": "CUMBERLAND PHARMACEUTICALS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nYou should carefully consider the risk factors described below and throughout this report, which could materially affect our business. There are also risks that are not presently known or not presently material, as well as the other information set forth in this report that could materially affect our business. In addition, in our periodic filings with the SEC, press releases and other statements, we discuss estimates and projections regarding our future performance and business outlook. By their nature, such \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that in some cases are out of our control. For a further discussion of forward-looking statements, please refer to the section entitled \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d These factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results or our present expectations and projections. These risk factors and uncertainties include, but are not limited to the following:\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nAn adverse development regarding our products could have a material and adverse impact on our future revenues and profitability.\nA number of factors may impact the effectiveness of our marketing and sales activities and the demand for our products, including:\n\u2022\nChanges in intellectual property protection available for our products or competing treatments;\n\u2022\nAny unfavorable publicity concerning us, our products, or the markets for these products such as information concerning product contamination or other safety issues in any of our product markets, whether or not directly involving our products;\n\u2022\nPerception by physicians and other members of the healthcare community of the safety or efficacy of our products or competing products;\n\u2022\nRegulatory developments related to our marketing and promotional practices or the manufacture or continued use of our products;\n\u2022\nThe prices of our products relative to other drugs or competing treatments;\n\u2022\nThe impact of current or additional generic competitors;\n\u2022\nThe availability and level of third-party reimbursement for sales of our products; and\n\u2022\nThe continued availability of adequate supplies of our products to meet demand.\nIf demand for our products weaken, our revenues and profitability will likely decline. Known adverse effects of our marketed products are documented in product labeling, including the product package inserts, medical information disclosed\nto medical professionals and all marketing-related materials. At this time, no unforeseen or serious adverse effects outside of those specified in current product labeling have been directly attributed to our approved products.\nWe currently market and sell five products: Acetadote, Caldolor, Kristalose, Vaprisol and Omeclamox-Pak. A product contamination or other safety or regulatory issues, such as a failure to meet certain FDA reporting requirements involving our products could negatively impact us and possibly lead to a product recall. In addition, changes impacting any of our products in areas such as competition, lack of market acceptance or demand, government regulation, intellectual property, reimbursement and manufacturing could have an adverse impact on our future revenues and profitability.\nThe FDA has requested prescribers and manufacturers of prescription combination products that contain acetaminophen to limit the amount of acetaminophen to no more than 325 milligrams (mg) in each tablet or capsule. The FDA requested this action to protect consumers from the risk of severe liver damage which can result from excess acetaminophen. This category of prescription drugs combines acetaminophen with another ingredient intended to treat pain (most often an opioid), and these products are commonly prescribed to consumers for pain, such as pain from acute injuries, post-operative pain, or pain following dental procedures.\nThe FDA also requires manufacturers to appropriately label all prescription combination acetaminophen products to warn of the potential risk for severe liver injury. The actions the FDA is taking for prescription acetaminophen combination products do not affect over-the-counter acetaminophen products. The FDA's regulation of acetaminophen in prescription combination products and over-the-counter products may reduce the number of acetaminophen overdoses which could result in a lower demand for Acetadote. If the demand for Acetadote decreases, it could have an adverse impact on our future revenues and profitability.\nCaldolor was approved by the FDA in June 2009, and we started commercializing Caldolor in the United States in September 2009. The commercial success of Caldolor is dependent on many third-parties, including physicians, pharmacists, hospital pharmacy and therapeutics committees, or P&T committees, suppliers and distributors, all of whom we have little or no control over. We expect Caldolor to continue to be administered primarily to hospital and surgery center patients who are unable to receive oral therapies for the treatment of pain or fever. Before we can distribute Caldolor to any new hospital customers, Caldolor must be approved for addition to the hospitals\u2019 formulary lists by their P&T committees. A hospital\u2019s P&T committee generally governs all matters pertaining to the use of medications within the institution, including review of medication formulary data and recommendations of drugs to the medical staff. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in getting the approvals we need from enough P&T committees to be able to optimize hospital sales of Caldolor. Even if we obtain hospital approval for Caldolor, we must still convince individuals hospital physicians to prescribe Caldolor repeatedly. The commercial success of Caldolor also depends on our ability to coordinate supply, distribution, marketing, sales and education efforts. As with our other products, if Caldolor is not accepted in the marketplace, it could have an adverse impact on our future revenues and profitability.\nIf any manufacturer we rely upon fails to produce our products in the amounts we require on a timely basis, or fails to comply with stringent regulations applicable to pharmaceutical drug manufacturers, we may be unable to meet demand for our products and may lose potential revenues.\nWe do not manufacture any of our products, and we do not currently plan to develop any capacity to do so. Our dependence upon third parties for the manufacture of products could adversely affect our profit margins or our ability to develop and deliver products on a timely and competitive basis. If for any reason we are unable to obtain or retain third-party manufacturers on commercially acceptable terms, we may not be able to sell our products as planned. Furthermore, if we encounter delays or difficulties with contract manufacturers in producing our products, the distribution, marketing and subsequent sales of these products could be adversely affected.\nCaldolor: Caldolor has historically been manufactured at Hospira Australia Pty. Ltd.\u2019s facility in Australia and Bayer\u2019s facility in Kansas. We entered into agreements with three manufacturers for the commercial supply of Caldolor. We have successfully transferred the Caldolor manufacturing process to two of these manufacturers and these two suppliers have manufactured inventory under these agreements. During 2015, we began the process of obtaining a third supplier for the manufacture of commercial supply of Caldolor and expect to obtain commercial supply from this manufacturer during 2016. If the manufacturers of Caldolor are unable to produce marketable inventory in sufficient quantities, in the agreed upon time period, we could suffer an inability to meet demand for our product.\nAcetadote: Acetadote was previously manufactured and packaged by two entities: at Bayer\u2019s facility in Kansas through January 2014 and in Ireland by Mylan through April 2014. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we entered into an agreement with a U.S. based manufacturer to supply our Acetadote product. We have transferred the Acetadote manufacturing process to this supplier and received and sold commercial units from them during 2015. If the manufacturer of Acetadote is unable\nto produce marketable inventory in sufficient quantities, in the agreed upon time period, we could suffer an inability to meet demand for our product.\nKristalose: The active pharmaceutical ingredient for Kristalose is manufactured at a single facility in Italy and we have manufacturing agreements with two Kristalose packagers. If these facilities are damaged or destroyed, or if local conditions result in a work stoppage, we could suffer an inability to meet demand for our product. Kristalose is manufactured through a complex process. It would be particularly difficult to find a new manufacturer of Kristalose on an expedited basis. As a result of these factors, our ability to manufacture Kristalose may be substantially impaired if the manufacturer is unable or unwilling to supply sufficient quantities of the product.\nOmeclamox-Pak: Under the agreement we signed with Pernix, they were responsible for providing Omeclamox-Pak inventory. Effective with the November 2015 agreement with GEL, Cumberland assumes supply chain responsibilities and will now work directly with GEL to ensure availability of Omeclamox-Pak. If we are unable to obtain marketable inventory in the future we could suffer an inability to meet demand for our product.\nVaprisol: As part of the acquisition of Vaprisol, we purchased an existing supply of raw material inventory. In addition, as part of this transaction, we were assigned a commercial supply agreement with the manufacturer Astellas used to prepare, package, inspect and label Vaprisol. The manufacturer continues to supply commercial inventory to Cumberland under this agreement. If the manufacturer of Vaprisol is unable to produce additional marketable inventory in sufficient quantities, in the agreed upon time period, we could suffer an inability to meet demand for our product.\nIn addition, all manufacturers of our products and product candidates must comply with current good manufacturing practices, (\"GMPs\"), enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program. These requirements include quality control, quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturers of our products may be unable to comply with GMP requirements and with other FDA, state and foreign regulatory requirements.\nWe have no control over our manufacturers\u2019 compliance with these regulations and standards. If our third-party manufacturers do not comply with these requirements, we could be subject to:\n\u2022\nFines and civil penalties;\n\u2022\nSuspension of production or distribution;\n\u2022\nSuspension or delay in product approval;\n\u2022\nproduct seizure or recall; and\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of product approval.\nWe are dependent on a variety of other third parties. If these third parties fail to perform as we expect, our operations could be disrupted and our financial results could suffer.\nWe have a relatively small internal infrastructure. We rely on a variety of third parties, in addition to our manufacturers, to help us operate our business. Other third parties on which we rely include:\n\u2022\nCardinal Health Specialty Pharmaceutical Services, a logistics and fulfillment company and business unit of Cardinal, which bills for, collects, warehouses and ships our marketed products; and\n\u2022\nVanderbilt University, Gloria and the Tennessee Technology Development Corporation, co-owners with us of CET, and the universities that collaborate with us in connection with CET's research and development programs.\nIf these third parties do not continue to provide services to us, or collaborate with us, we might not be able to obtain others who can serve these functions. This could disrupt our business operations, increase our operating expenses or otherwise adversely affect our operating results.\nCompetitive pressures could reduce our revenues and profits.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is intensely competitive. Our strategy is to target differentiated products in specialized markets. However, this strategy does not relieve us from competitive pressures and can entail distinct competitive risks. Certain of our competitors do not aggressively promote their products in our markets. An increase in promotional activity in our markets could result in large shifts in market share, adversely impacting us.\nOur competitors may sell or develop drugs that are more effective and useful or less costly than ours, and they may be more successful in manufacturing and marketing their products. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial and marketing resources than we do. Additional competitors may enter our markets.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is characterized by constant and significant investment in new product development, which can result in rapid technological change. The introduction of new products could substantially reduce our market share or render our products obsolete. The selling prices of pharmaceutical products tend to decline as competition increases, through new product introduction or otherwise, which could reduce our revenues and profitability.\nGovernmental and private healthcare payors emphasize substitution of branded pharmaceuticals with less expensive generic equivalents. An increase in the sales of generic pharmaceutical products could result in a decrease in revenues of our branded pharmaceuticals.\nAny attempt by us to expand the potential market for any of our products is subject to limitations.\nExpansion of the market for our products may be subject to certain limitations. In the past, these limitations have included FDA required Phase IV commitments. We may also experience delays associated with future required Phase IV clinical studies potentially resulting from, among other factors, difficulty enrolling patients. Such delays could impact our ability to explore opportunities for label expansion and limit our ability to bring our products to new patient populations.\nIn addition, we have only obtained regulatory approval to market our products in the United States. Not all foreign jurisdictions may represent attractive opportunities for our products due to pricing, competitive, regulatory or other factors. In certain foreign jurisdictions, we have licensed the right to market some of our products to third parties. These third parties are responsible for seeking regulatory approval for the products in their respective jurisdictions. We have no control over these third parties and cannot be sure that marketing approval for our products will be obtained outside the United States.\nOur future growth depends on our ability to identify and acquire rights to products. If we do not successfully identify and acquire rights to products, our growth opportunities may be limited.\nWe acquired rights to Caldolor, Acetadote, Omeclamox-Pak, Vaprisol, Kristalose and Hepatoren. Our business strategy is to continue to acquire rights to FDA-approved products as well as pharmaceutical product candidates in the late stages of development. We do not plan to conduct basic research or pre-clinical product development, except to the extent of our investment in CET. As compared to large multi-national pharmaceutical companies, we have limited resources to acquire third-party products, businesses and technologies and integrate them into our current infrastructure. Many acquisition opportunities involve competition among several potential purchasers including large multi-national pharmaceutical companies and other competitors that have access to greater financial resources than we do. With future acquisitions, we may face financial and operational risks and uncertainties. We may not be able to engage in future product acquisitions, and those we do complete may not be beneficial to us in the long term.\nFurthermore, other products in development may encounter unforeseen issues during their clinical trials. Any unforeseen issues or lack of FDA approval will negatively affect marketing and development plans for those products.\nOur future growth depends on our ability to successfully integrate acquired product brands into our operations. If we do not successfully integrate acquired product brands into our operations, our growth opportunities may be limited.\nWe added two marketed products to our portfolio of brands: Omeclamox-Pak in the fourth quarter of 2013 and Vaprisol during the first quarter of 2014. We successfully launched our promotional efforts to support both brands during 2014. If we are unable to continue to build on our initial success with these brands or we are unable to successfully integrate the marketing, sale and distribution of any other potential products into our current infrastructure or if they require significantly greater resources than originally anticipated, we may face financial and operational risks and uncertainties. If we are unable to successfully integrate any acquired brands, both current and future, these product acquisitions may not be beneficial to us in the long term.\nOur Hepatoren and Boxaban product candidates have not been approved for sale and may never be successfully commercialized.\nWe anticipate that a portion of our future revenue growth will come from sales of our Hepatoren and Boxaban product candidates. Hepatoren (intravenous ifetroban) and Boxaban (oral ifetroban) are candidates used to treat hepatorenal syndrome (\"HRS\") and aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease (\"AERD\"), respectively. However, ifetroban has not been approved by the FDA for marketing, and these product candidates are still subject to risks associated with their development.\nThe FDA has cleared our IND's for these product candidates as we evaluate them as treatments for these conditions. Delays in the enrollment and completion of the clinical studies could significantly delay commercial launch and affect our product development costs. Moreover, results from the clinical studies may not be favorable.\nEven if they are eventually developed and approved by the FDA, they may never gain significant acceptance in the marketplace and therefore never generate substantial revenue or profits for us. Physicians may determine that existing drugs\nare adequate to address patients' needs. The extent to which these product candidates will be reimbursed by the U.S. government or third-party payors is also currently unknown.\nAs a result of the foregoing and other factors, we do not know the extent to which Hepatoren and Boxaban will contribute to our future growth.\nIf we are unable to maintain, train and build an effective sales and marketing infrastructure, we will not be able to commercialize and grow our products and product candidates successfully.\nAs we grow, we may not be able to secure sales personnel or organizations that are adequate in number or expertise to successfully market and sell our products. This risk would be accentuated if we acquire products in areas outside of hospital acute care and gastroenterology since our sales forces specialize in these areas. If we are unable to expand our sales and marketing capability, train our sales force effectively or provide any other capabilities necessary to commercialize our products and product candidates, we will need to contract with third parties to market and sell our products. We must train our employees on proper regulatory compliance, including, but not limited to, \u201cfair balance\u201d promotion of our products and anti-kickback laws. If we are unable to establish and maintain compliant and adequate sales and marketing capabilities, we may not be able to increase our product revenue, may generate increased expenses and may experience regulatory compliance issues.\nIf governmental or third-party payors do not provide adequate reimbursement for our products, our revenue and prospects for profitability may be limited.\nOur financial success depends, in part, on the availability of adequate reimbursement from third-party healthcare payors. Such third-party payors include governmental health programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, managed care providers and private health insurers. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the pricing of medical products and services, while governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare. Adoption of such legislation could further limit reimbursement for pharmaceuticals.\nIn March 2010, the U.S. government passed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, (\"PPACA\") along with the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, (\"HCERA\"), which modified the revenue provisions of the PPACA. The PPACA, as amended by the HCERA, constitutes the healthcare reform legislation. The legislation calls for an increase in certain Medicare drug rebates paid by pharmaceutical manufacturers and an industry fee imposed on pharmaceutical manufacturers according to the individual manufacturer\u2019s relative percentage of total industry sales to specified government programs. At this time no assurances can be given that these measures, or any other measures included in the Healthcare Reform Act, will not have an adverse effect on our revenues in the future. Furthermore, future cost control initiatives, legislation and regulations could decrease the price that we receive for any products, which would limit our revenue and profitability.\nAlso, reimbursement practices of third-party payors might preclude us from achieving market acceptance for our products or maintaining price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product acquisition and development. If we cannot obtain adequate reimbursement levels, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nOur employees have been trained to submit accurate and correct pricing information to payors. If, despite the training, our employees provide incorrect or fraudulent information, then we will be subject to various administrative and judicial investigations and litigation.\n\u201cFormulary\u201d practices of third-party payors could adversely affect our competitive position.\nMany managed healthcare organizations are now controlling the pharmaceutical products included on their formulary lists. Having products listed on these formulary lists creates competition among pharmaceutical companies which, in turn, has created a trend of downward pricing pressure in our industry. In addition, many managed care organizations are pursuing various ways to reduce pharmaceutical costs and are considering formulary contracts primarily with those pharmaceutical companies that can offer a full line of products for a given therapy sector or disease state. Our products might not be included on the formulary lists of managed care organizations, and downward pricing pressure in our industry generally could negatively impact our operations.\nContinued consolidation of distributor networks in the pharmaceutical industry as well as increases in retailer concentration may limit our ability to profitably sell our products.\nWe sell most of our products to large pharmaceutical wholesalers, who in turn sell to hospitals, surgery centers and retail pharmacies. The distribution network for pharmaceutical products has become increasingly consolidated in recent years. Further consolidation or financial difficulties could also cause our customers to reduce the amounts of our products that they purchase, which would materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur CET joint initiative may not result in our gaining access to commercially viable products.\nOur CET joint initiative with Vanderbilt University, Gloria and Tennessee Technology Development Corporation is designed to help us investigate, in a cost-effective manner, early-stage products and technologies. However, we may never gain access to commercially viable products from CET for a variety of reasons, including:\n\u2022\nCET investigates early-stage products, which have the greatest risk of failure prior to FDA approval and commercialization;\n\u2022\nIn some programs, we do not have pre-set rights to product candidates developed by CET. We would need to agree with CET and its collaborators on the terms of any product licensed to, or acquired by, us;\n\u2022\nWe rely principally on government grants to fund CET\u2019s research and development programs. If these grants were no longer available, we or our co-owners might be unable or unwilling to fund CET operations at current levels or at all;\n\u2022\nWe may become involved in disputes with our co-owners regarding CET policy or operations, such as how best to deploy CET assets or which product opportunities to pursue. Disagreement could disrupt or halt product development; and\n\u2022\nCET may disagree with one of the various universities with which CET is collaborating on research. A disagreement could disrupt or halt product development.\nWe depend on our key personnel, the loss of whom would adversely affect our operations. If we fail to attract and retain the talent required for our business, our business will be materially harmed.\nWe are a relatively small company, and we depend to a great extent on principal members of our management, scientific staff, and sales representatives and managers. If we lose the services of any key personnel, in particular, A.J. Kazimi, our Chief Executive Officer, or other members of senior management it could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects. Mr. Kazimi, plays a key role in several operational and strategic decisions such that any loss of his services due to death or disability would adversely impact our day-to-day operations. We have a life insurance policy covering the life of Mr. Kazimi. We have entered into agreements with each of our employees that contain restrictive covenants relating to non-competition and non-solicitation of our customers and suppliers for one year after termination of employment. Nevertheless, each of our officers and key employees may terminate his or her employment at any time without notice and without cause or good reason, and so as a practical matter these agreements do not guarantee the continued service of these employees. Our success depends on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific, technical, sales and managerial personnel and research partners. Competition among pharmaceutical companies for qualified employees is intense, and we may not be able to retain existing personnel or attract and retain qualified staff in the future. If we experience difficulties in hiring and retaining personnel in key positions, we could suffer from delays in product development, loss of customers and sales and diversion of management resources, which could adversely affect operating results.\nThe size of our organization and our potential growth may lead to difficulties in managing operations.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had 78 full-time employees. We may need to continue to expand our managerial, operational, financial and other resources in order to increase our marketing efforts with regard to our currently marketed products, continue our business development and product development activities and commercialize our product candidates. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, growth and increased expenses in the scope of our operations in connection with the continued marketing and development of our products. Our financial performance will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any such growth and expenses of the current organization effectively.\nWe face potential product liability exposure, and if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability for a product or product candidate and may have to limit its commercialization.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability lawsuits related to the testing of our product candidates and the commercial sale of our products. An individual may bring a liability claim against us if one of our product candidates or products causes, or appears to have caused, an injury. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against the product liability claim, we may incur substantial liabilities. Liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\nDecreased demand for our products;\n\u2022\nInjury to our reputation;\n\u2022\nWithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022\nSignificant litigation costs;\n\u2022\nSubstantial monetary awards to or costly settlement with patients;\n\u2022\nProduct recalls;\n\u2022\nLoss of revenue; and\n\u2022\nThe inability to commercialize our product candidates.\nWe are highly dependent upon medical and patient perceptions of us and the safety and quality of our products. We could be adversely affected if we or our products are subject to negative publicity. We could also be adversely affected if any of our products or any similar products sold by other companies prove to be, or are asserted to be, harmful to patients. Also, because of our dependence upon medical and patient perceptions, any adverse publicity associated with illness or other adverse effects resulting from the use or misuse of our products or any similar products sold by other companies could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe have product liability insurance that covers our clinical trials, the marketing and sale of our products up to a $10 million annual aggregate limit, subject to specified deductibles. Our current or future insurance coverage may prove insufficient to cover any liability claims brought against us.\nBecause of the increasing costs of insurance coverage, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or obtain insurance coverage that will be adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.\nRegulatory approval for any approved product is limited by the FDA to those specific indications and conditions for which clinical safety and efficacy have been demonstrated.\nAny regulatory approval is limited to those specific diseases and indications for which a product is deemed to be safe and effective by the FDA. In addition to the FDA approval required for new formulations, any new indication for an approved product also requires FDA approval. If we are not able to obtain FDA approval for any desired future indications for our products, our ability to effectively market and sell our products may be reduced and our business may be adversely affected.\nWhile physicians may choose to prescribe drugs for uses that are not described in the product\u2019s labeling and for uses that differ from those tested in clinical studies and approved by the regulatory authorities, our ability to promote the products is limited to those indications that are specifically approved by the FDA. These \u201coff-label\u201d uses are common across medical specialties and may constitute an appropriate treatment for some patients in varied circumstances. Regulatory authorities in the U.S. generally do not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. Regulatory authorities do, however, restrict communications by pharmaceutical companies on the subject of off-label use. If our promotional activities fail to comply with these regulations or guidelines, we may be subject to warnings from, or enforcement action by, these authorities. In addition, our failure to follow FDA rules and guidelines relating to promotion and advertising may cause the FDA to suspend or withdraw an approved product from the market, require a recall or payment of fines, or could result in disgorgement of money, operating restrictions, injunctions or criminal prosecution, any of which could harm our business.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures, security breaches, adverse events or other disruptions within our information technology infrastructure at our corporate headquarters.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems, including those at our corporate headquarters, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. In the ordinary course of our business, we store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers. We also maintain personally identifiable information of our employees in our data centers and on our networks. The secure processing and maintenance of this information is critical to our operations. In the event that our corporate headquarters and/or our computer systems are disabled or materially damaged, it would have a substantial and material negative effect on our operations. Furthermore, any system failure, accident or security breach that causes interruptions in our operations could result in a material disruption of our drug development programs. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we may incur liability and the further development of our products or product candidates may be delayed.\nRISKS RELATING TO GOVERNMENT REGULATION\nWe are subject to stringent government regulation. All of our products face regulatory challenges.\nVirtually all aspects of our business activities are regulated by government agencies. The manufacturing, processing, formulation, packaging, labeling, distribution, promotion and sampling, advertising of our products, and disposal of waste products arising from such activities are subject to governmental regulation. These activities are regulated by one or more of the FDA, the Federal Trade Commission, (\"FTC\"), the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, (\"EPA\"), as well as by comparable agencies in foreign countries. These activities are also regulated by various agencies of the states and localities in which our products are sold. For more information, see \u201cBusiness-Government Regulation\".\nLike all pharmaceutical manufacturers, we are subject to regulation by the FDA under the FDCA. All new drugs must be the subject of an FDA-approved new drug application, (\"NDA\"), before they may be marketed in the United States. The FDA has the authority to withdraw existing NDA approvals and to review the regulatory status of products marketed under the enforcement policy. The FDA may require an approved NDA for any drug product marketed under the enforcement policy if new information reveals questions about the drug\u2019s safety and effectiveness. All drugs must be manufactured in conformity with GMP, and drug products subject to an approved NDA must be manufactured, processed, packaged, held and labeled in accordance with information contained in the NDA. Since we rely on third parties to manufacture our products, GMP requirements directly affect our third party manufacturers and indirectly affect us. The manufacturing facilities of our third-party manufacturers are continually subject to inspection by such governmental agencies, and manufacturing operations could be interrupted or halted in any such facilities if such inspections prove unsatisfactory. Our third-party manufacturers are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA to assure such compliance.\nPharmaceutical products must be distributed, sampled and promoted in accordance with FDA requirements. We must train our employees on proper regulatory compliance, including, but not limited to, \u201cfair balance\u201d promotion of our products and anti-kickback laws. The FDA also regulates the advertising of prescription drugs. The FDA has the authority to request post-approval commitments that can be time-consuming and expensive.\nUnder the FDCA, the federal government has extensive enforcement powers over the activities of pharmaceutical manufacturers to ensure compliance with FDA regulations. Those powers include, but are not limited to, the authority to initiate court action to seize unapproved or non-complying products, to enjoin non-complying activities, to halt manufacturing operations that are not in compliance with GMP, and to seek civil monetary and criminal penalties. The initiation of any of these enforcement activities, including the restriction or prohibition on sales of our products, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny change in the FDA\u2019s enforcement policy could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe cannot determine what effect changes in regulations or statutes or legal interpretation, when and if promulgated or enacted, may have on our business in the future. Such changes, or new legislation, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nProposed legislation may permit re-importation of drugs from other countries into the U.S., including foreign countries where the drugs are sold at lower prices than in the U.S., which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our overall financial condition.\nIn previous years, legislation has been introduced in Congress that, if enacted, would permit more widespread re-importation of drugs from foreign countries into the U.S., which may include re-importation from foreign countries where the drugs are sold at lower prices than in the U.S. Such legislation, or similar regulatory changes, if enacted, could decrease the price we receive for any approved products which, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our overall financial condition.\nWe must comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\nWe are required to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits U.S. companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Foreign companies, including some of our competitors, are not subject to these prohibitions. If our competitors engage in these practices, they may receive preferential treatment from personnel of some companies, giving our competitors an advantage in securing business from government officials who might give them priority in obtaining new licenses, which would put us at a disadvantage. We have established formal policies or procedures for prohibiting or monitoring this conduct, but we cannot assure you that our employees or other agents will not engage in such conduct for which we might be held responsible. If our employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties.\nWe must comply with the Physician Payment Sunshine Act.\nWe are required to comply with the United States Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of drugs, medical devices and biologicals that participate in U.S. federal healthcare programs to report certain payments and items of value given to physicians and teaching hospitals. Manufacturers are required to report this information annually to The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). Cumberland has implemented a series of policies and procedures for every employee involved in the data collection process, and has systems in place to capture the data, which is verified by an outside firm that specializes in reporting the payments. Cumberland has also established a redundant system to ensure that data was reported completely, in the correct format, and on time. Despite these policies, procedures and systems, we cannot assure you that we will collect and report all data accurately. If we fail to accurately report this information, we could suffer severe penalties.\nRISKS RELATING TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nOur strategy to secure and extend marketing exclusivity or patent rights may provide only limited or no protection from competition.\nWe seek to secure and extend marketing exclusivity for our products through a variety of means, including FDA exclusivity and patent rights. Additional barriers for competitors seeking to enter the market include the time and cost associated with the development, regulatory approval and manufacturing of a similar product formulation.\nAcetadote is indicated to prevent or lessen hepatic (liver) injury when administered intravenously within eight to ten hours after ingesting quantities of acetaminophen that are potentially toxic to the liver. As discussed in Part I, Item 1, Business - Trademarks, Patents and Proprietary Rights, of this Form 10-K, during April 2012, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (the \u201cUSPTO\u201d) issued U.S. Patent number 8,148,356 (the \u201c356 Acetadote Patent\u201d) which is assigned to us. The claims of the 356 Acetadote Patent encompass the new Acetadote formulation and include composition of matter claims. Following its issuance, the 356 Acetadote Patent was listed in the FDA Orange Book. The 356 Acetadote Patent is scheduled to expire in May 2026, which time period includes a 270-day patent term adjustment granted by the USPTO.\nFollowing the issuance of the 356 Acetadote Patent, we received separate Paragraph IV certification notices from InnoPharma, Inc., Paddock Laboratories, LLC (\"Paddock\") and Mylan Institutional LLC challenging the 356 Acetadote Patent on the basis of non-infringement and/or invalidity. On May 17, 2012, we responded to the Paragraph IV certification notices by filing three separate lawsuits for infringement of the 356 Acetadote Patent. The first lawsuit was filed against Mylan Institutional LLC and Mylan Inc. (\"Mylan\") in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division. The second lawsuit was filed against InnoPharma, Inc. in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. The third lawsuit was also filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against Paddock and Perrigo Company (\"Perrigo\"). On May 20, 2012, we received a Paragraph IV certification notice from Sagent Agila LLC challenging the 356 Acetadote Patent. On June 26, 2012, we filed a lawsuit for infringement of the 356 Acetadote Patent against Sagent Agila LLC and Sagent Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (\"Sagent\") in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. On July 9, 2012, we received a Paragraph IV certification notice from Perrigo. On August 9, 2012, we filed a lawsuit for infringement of the 356 Acetadote Patent against Perrigo in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division.\nOn November 12, 2012, we entered into a Settlement Agreement (the \u201cSettlement Agreement\u201d) with Paddock and Perrigo to resolve the challenges and the pending litigation with each of Paddock and Perrigo involving the 356 Acetadote Patent. Under the Settlement Agreement, Paddock and Perrigo admit that the 356 Acetadote Patent is valid and enforceable and that any Paddock or Perrigo generic Acetadote product (with or without EDTA) would infringe upon the 356 Acetadote Patent. In addition, Paddock and Perrigo will not challenge the validity, enforceability, ownership or patentability of the 356 Acetadote Patent through its expiration currently scheduled for May 2026. On November 12, 2012, in connection with the execution of the Settlement Agreement, we entered into a License and Supply Agreement with Paddock and Perrigo (the \u201cLicense and Supply Agreement\u201d). Under the terms of the License and Supply Agreement, if a third party receives final approval from the FDA for an ANDA to sell a generic Acetadote product and such third party has made such generic version available for purchase in commercial quantities in the United States, we will supply Perrigo with an Authorized Generic version of our Acetadote product.\nOn May 18, 2012, we also submitted a Citizen Petition to the FDA requesting that the FDA refrain from approving any applications for acetylcysteine injection that contain EDTA, based in part on the FDA's request that we evaluate the reduction or removal of EDTA from its original Acetadote formulation. On November 7, 2012, the FDA responded to the Citizen Petition denying our request and stating that ANDAs referencing Acetadote that contain EDTA may be accepted and approved provided they meet all applicable requirements. We believe this response contradicts the FDA's request to evaluate the reduction or removal of EDTA. On November 8, 2012, we learned that the FDA approved the ANDA referencing Acetadote filed by InnoPharma, Inc. On November 13, 2012, we brought suit against the FDA in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that the FDA's denial of our Citizen Petition and acceptance for review and approval of any InnoPharma, Inc. product containing EDTA was arbitrary and in violation of law.\nWe found during the resulting legal proceedings that the FDA initially concluded that the original Acetadote formulation was withdrawn for safety reasons and no generic versions should be approved. The FDA later reversed its position based on the possibility of drug shortages and the presence of EDTA in other formulations. At the same time, the FDA noted that exclusively marketing a non-EDTA containing product would be preferable because it would eliminate the potential risk of EDTA.\nOn January 7, 2013, Perrigo announced initial distribution of our Authorized Generic acetylcysteine injection product.\nOn March 19, 2013, the USPTO issued U.S. Patent number 8,399,445 (the \u201c445 Acetadote Patent\u201d) which is also assigned to us. The claims of the 445 Acetadote Patent encompass the use of the 200 mg/ml Acetadote formulation to treat patients with acetaminophen overdose. On April 8, 2013, the 445 Acetadote Patent was listed in the FDA Orange Book. The 445 Acetadote Patent is scheduled to expire in August 2025. Following the issuance of the 445 Acetadote Patent we have received separate Paragraph IV certification notices from Perrigo, Sagent, and Mylan challenging the 445 Acetadote Patent on the basis of non-infringement, unenforceability and/or invalidity.\nOn June 10, 2013, we became aware of a Paragraph IV certification notice from Akorn, Inc. challenging the 445 Acetadote Patent and the 356 Acetadote Patent on the basis of non-infringement. On July 12, 2013, we filed a lawsuit for infringement of the 356 Acetadote Patent against Akorn, Inc. in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware.\nOn June 10, 2013, we announced that the FDA approved updated labeling for Acetadote. The new labeling revises the product's indication and offers new dosing guidance for specific patient populations.\nOn September 30, 2013, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia filed an opinion granting a Summary Judgment in favor of the FDA regarding Cumberland\u2019s November 13, 2012 suit. On November 1, 2013, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware filed opinions granting Sagent\u2019s and InnoPharma\u2019s motions to dismiss our May 2012 and June 2012 suits.\nOn February18, 2014, the USPTO issued U.S. Patent number 8,653,061 (the \u201c061 Acetadote Patent\u201d) which is assigned to us. The claims of the 061 Acetadote Patent encompass the use of the 200 mg/ml Acetadote formulation to treat patients with acetaminophen overdose. Following its issuance, the 061 Acetadote Patent was listed in the FDA Orange Book. The 061 Acetadote Patent is scheduled to expire in August 2025.\nOn May 13, 2014, the USPTO issued U.S. Patent number 8,722,738 (the \u201c738 Acetadote Patent\u201d) which is assigned to us. The claims of the 738 Acetadote Patent encompass administration methods of acetylcysteine injection, without specification of the presence or lack of EDTA in the injection. Following its issuance, the 738 Acetadote Patent was listed in the FDA Orange Book and it is scheduled to expire in April 2032.\nOn December 11, 2014 and March 3, 2015, we became aware of Paragraph IV certification notices from Aurobindo Pharma Limited and Zydus Pharmaceuticals (USA) Inc., respectively, challenging the 356, 445, 061, and 738 Acetadote Patents on the basis of non-infringement.\nBy statute, where the Paragraph IV certification is to a patent timely listed before an Abbreviated New Drug Application (\u201cANDA\u201d) is filed, a company has 45 days to institute a patent infringement lawsuit during which period the FDA may not approve another application. In addition, such a lawsuit for patent infringement filed within such 45-day period may stay, or bar, the FDA from approving another product application for two and a half years or until a district court decision that is adverse to the asserted patents, whichever is earlier.\nOn February 10, 2015, the USPTO issued U.S. Patent number 8,952,065 (the \u201c065 Acetadote Patent\u201d) which is assigned to us. The claims of the 065 Acetadote Patent encompass the use of the 200 mg/ml Acetadote formulation to treat patients with acute liver failure. The 065 Acetadote Patent is scheduled to expire in August 2025.\nOn September 30, 2015, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division (\"District Court\") ruled in our favor in our lawsuit against Mylan for infringement of the 445 Acetadote Patent. The opinion upheld our 445 Acetadote Patent and expressly rejected Mylan's validity challenge. The District Court ruled that Mylan is liable to us for infringement of the 445 Acetadote patent in light of Mylan's Abbreviated New Drug Application in which Mylan sought to market a generic version of Acetadote. On November 17, 2015, the District Court entered an order enjoining Mylan and its affiliates from selling or using its generic version of Acetadote until August 2025, the date of expiration of the 445 Acetadote Patent. On October 30, 2015, Mylan filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.\nWe also have additional patent applications relating to Acetadote which are pending with the USPTO and may or may not be issued. We intend to continue to vigorously defend and protect our Acetadote product and related intellectual property rights. If we are unsuccessful in protecting our Acetadote intellectual property rights, our competitors may be able to introduce products into the marketplace that reduce the sales and market share of our Acetadote product which may require us to take measures such as reducing prices or increasing our marketing expense, any of which may result in a material adverse effect to our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have U.S. patents and related international patents which include composition of matter claims that encompass the Caldolor formulation, including methods of treating pain using intravenous ibuprofen and claims directed to ibuprofen solution formulations, methods of making the same, and methods of using the same, and which are related to our formulation and manufacture of Caldolor. Additionally, the active ingredient in Caldolor, ibuprofen, is in the public domain, and a competitor could try to develop, test and seek FDA approval for a sufficiently distinct formulation for another ibuprofen product that competes with Caldolor. The U.S. patents are listed in the FDA Orange Book, with one expiring in November 2021, four others expiring in September 2029 and one other expiring in September 2030.\nWe have numerous U.S. patents and related international patents for Vaprisol. These patents were acquired in our February 2014 acquisition of certain product rights, intellectual property and related assets of Vaprisol from Astellas. The primary patent is U.S. Patent No. 5,723,606 (the \u201c606 Vaprisol Patent\u201d) which includes composition of matter claims that encompass the Vaprisol formulation as well as methods for the intravenous treatment of patients with euvolemic hyponatremia. The 606 Vaprisol Patent is listed in the FDA Orange Book and expires in December 2019.\nWhile we consider patent protection when evaluating product acquisition opportunities, any products we acquire in the future may not have significant patent protection. Neither the USPTO nor the courts have a consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed or the degree of protection afforded under many pharmaceutical patents. Patent applications in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months\nfollowing the filing date of the first related application, and in some cases not at all. In addition, publication of discoveries in scientific literature often lags significantly behind actual discoveries. Therefore, neither we nor our licensors can be certain that we or they were the first to make the inventions claimed in our issued patents or pending patent applications, or that we or they were the first to file for protection of the inventions set forth in these patent applications. In addition, changes in either patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the U.S. and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate technology developed by us in a manner that does not infringe our patents or other intellectual property. As a result of these factors, our patent rights may not provide any commercially valuable protection from competing products.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know-how, the value of our technology and products could be adversely affected.\nIn addition to patents, we rely upon trade secrets, unpatented proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or attainable. For example, the manufacturing process for Kristalose involves substantial trade secrets and proprietary know-how. We have entered into confidentiality agreements with certain key employees and consultants pursuant to which such employees and consultants must assign to us any inventions relating to our business if made by them while they are our employees, as well as certain confidentiality agreements relating to the acquisition of rights to products. Confidentiality agreements can be breached, though, and we might not have adequate remedies for any breach. Also, others could acquire or independently develop similar technology.\nWe may depend on certain licensors for the maintenance and enforcement of intellectual property rights and have limited, if any, control over the amount or timing of resources that our licensors devote on our behalf.\nWhen we license products, we often depend on our licensors to protect the proprietary rights covering those products. We have limited, if any, control over the amount or timing of resources that our licensors devote on our behalf or the priority they place on maintaining patent or other rights and prosecuting patent applications to our advantage. While any such licensor is expected to be contractually obligated to diligently pursue its patent applications and allow us the opportunity to consult, review and comment on patent office communications, we cannot be sure that it will perform as required. If a licensor does not perform and if we do not assume the maintenance of the licensed patents in sufficient time to make required payments or filings with the appropriate governmental agencies, we risk losing the benefit of all or some of those patent rights.\nIf the use of our technology conflicts with the intellectual property rights of third parties, we may incur substantial liabilities, and we may be unable to commercialize products based on this technology in a profitable manner or at all.\nIf our products conflict with the intellectual property rights of others, they could bring legal action against us or our licensors, licensees, manufacturers, customers or collaborators. If we were found to be infringing a patent or other intellectual property rights held by a third party, we could be forced to seek a license to use the patented or otherwise protected technology. We might not be able to obtain such a license on terms acceptable to us or at all. If legal action involving an alleged infringement or misappropriation were to be brought against us or our licensors, we would incur substantial costs in defending the action. If such a dispute were to be resolved against us, we could be subject to significant damages, and the manufacturing or sale of one or more of our products could be enjoined.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our collaborators or licensors, which could be costly and time consuming.\nWe have been involved in lawsuits for infringement of the Acetadote Patents as previously described. Because of their nature, these lawsuits can be costly and time-consuming, and we only experience limited benefits and patent protection. A significant adverse ruling in any such lawsuit could put the Acetadote Patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could compromise the issuance of our existing patent applications.\nCompetitors may infringe on our other patents or the patents of our collaborators or licensors. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is not valid or is\nunenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing.\nInterference proceedings brought by the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patent applications or those of our collaborators or licensors. Litigation or interference proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distraction of our management. We may not be able, alone or with our collaborators and licensors, to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect such rights as fully as in the United States.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, some of our confidential information could be disclosed during this type of litigation. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments.\nIf we breach any of the agreements under which we license rights to our products and product candidates from others, we could lose the ability to continue commercialization of our products and development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe have exclusive licenses for the marketing and sale of certain products and may acquire additional licenses. Such licenses may terminate prior to expiration if we breach our obligations under the license agreement related to these pharmaceutical products. For example, the licenses may terminate if we fail to meet specified quality control standards, including GMP with respect to the products, or commit a material breach of other terms and conditions of the licenses. Such early termination could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nAs is common in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although no claims against us are currently pending, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOur operating results are likely to fluctuate from period to period.\nWe are a company actively seeking to deliver significant growth. As we execute our business strategy of adding new products, like Vaprisol and Omeclamox-Pak, increasing market share in Caldolor and Kristalose and striving to maintain market share in our Acetadote product, we anticipate that there may be fluctuations in our future operating results. We may not be able to maintain or improve our current levels of revenue or income. Potential causes of future fluctuations in our operating results may include:\n\u2022\nNew product launches, which could increase revenues but also increase sales and marketing expenses;\n\u2022\nAcquisition activity and other charges (such as for inventory expiration);\n\u2022\nIncreases in research and development expenses resulting from the acquisition of a product candidate that requires significant additional studies and development;\n\u2022\nChanges in the competitive, regulatory or reimbursement environment, which could drive down revenues or drive up sales and marketing or compliance costs; and\n\u2022\nUnexpected product liability or intellectual property claims and lawsuits.\nSee also \u201cManagement\u2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations-Liquidity and capital resources.\u201d Fluctuation in operating results, particularly if not anticipated by investors and other members of the financial community, could add to volatility in our stock price.\nOur focus on acquisitions as a growth strategy has created intangible assets whose amortization could negatively affect our results of operations.\nOur total assets include intangible assets related to our acquisitions. As of December 31, 2015, intangible assets relating to products represented approximately 23% of our total assets. We may never realize the value of these assets. U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\") require that we evaluate on a regular basis whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate that all or a portion of the carrying amount of the asset may no longer be recoverable, in which case we would write down the value of the asset and take a corresponding charge to earnings. Any determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of unamortized intangible assets would adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may need additional funding and may be unable to raise capital when needed, which could force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development or commercialization and marketing efforts.\nWe may need to raise additional funds in order to meet the capital requirements of running our business and acquiring and developing new pharmaceutical products. If we require additional funding, we may seek to sell common stock or other equity or equity-linked securities, which could result in dilution to our shareholders. We may also seek to raise capital through a debt financing, which would result in ongoing debt-service payments and increased interest expense. Any financings would also likely involve operational and financial restrictions being imposed on us. We might also seek to sell assets or rights in one or more commercial products or product development programs. Additional capital might not be available to us when we need it. We are unable to predict the impact of global credit market trends, and if economic conditions deteriorate, our business, results of operations and ability to raise needed capital could be materially and adversely affected. If we are unable to raise additional capital when needed due to the reasons listed above and lack of creditworthiness, bank failures, or price decline in market investments, we could be forced to scale back our operations to conserve cash.\nIf we are unable to maintain appropriate internal financial reporting controls and procedures, it could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, result in the restatement of our financial statements, harm our operating results, subject us to regulatory scrutiny and sanction, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and have a negative effect on the market price for shares of our common stock.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and mitigate the risk of fraud. We maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting, which is defined as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, and affected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.\nWe cannot assure you that we will not, in the future, identify areas requiring improvement in our internal control over financial reporting. We cannot assure you that the measures we will take to improve these controls will be successful or that we will implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future as we continue to expand. If we are unable to establish appropriate internal financial reporting controls and procedures, it could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, result in the restatement of our financial statements, harm our operating results, subject us to regulatory scrutiny and sanction, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and have a negative effect on the market price for shares of our common stock.\nIn addition, we maintain a system of internal controls and provide training to employees designed to provide reasonable assurance that unlawful and fraudulent activity, including misappropriation of assets, fraudulent financial reporting, and unauthorized access to sensitive or confidential data is either prevented or timely detected. However, in the event that our employees engage in such fraudulent behavior, we could suffer material adverse consequences.\nChanges in, or interpretations of, accounting principles and tax laws could have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. These principles are subject to interpretation by the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles. A change\nin these principles can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions.\nFor example, in recent years, the U.S.-based Financial Accounting Standards Board, (\"FASB\"), has worked together with the International Accounting Standards Board, (\"IASB\"), on several projects to further align accounting principles and facilitate more comparable financial reporting between companies who are required to follow GAAP under SEC regulations and those who are required to follow International Financial Reporting Standards, (\"IFRS\"), outside of the U.S. These efforts by the FASB and IASB may result in different accounting principles under GAAP that may result in materially different financial results for us in areas including, but not limited to, principles for revenue recognition and lease accounting.\nRISKS RELATED TO OWNING OUR STOCK\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially.\nThe price for the shares of our common stock sold in our initial public offering was determined by negotiation between the representatives of the underwriters and us. This price may not have reflected the market price of our common stock following our initial public offering. Through March 1, 2016, the closing price of our common stock since our initial public offering has ranged from a low of $4.03 to a high of $17.05 per share. Moreover, the market price of our common stock might decline below current levels. In addition, the market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales may occur could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nThe realization of any of the risks described in these \u201cRisk Factors\u201d could have a dramatic and material adverse impact on the market price of our common stock. In addition, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies whose securities have experienced periods of volatility in market price. Any such securities litigation brought against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales may occur could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nUnstable market conditions may have serious adverse consequences on our business.\nOur general business strategy may be adversely affected by unpredictable and unstable market conditions. While we believe we have adequate capital resources to meet current working capital and capital expenditure requirements, a radical economic downturn or increase in our expenses could require additional financing on less than attractive rates or on terms that are dilutive to existing shareholders. Failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy, financial performance and stock price and could require us to delay or abandon clinical developments plans. There is a risk that one or more of our current service providers, manufacturers and other partners may encounter difficult economic circumstances, which would directly affect our ability to attain our operating goals on schedule and on budget.\nWe are experiencing increased costs and regulatory risk as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will be required to devote additional time to new compliance initiatives.\nWe have and will continue to incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote additional time to new compliance initiatives. As a public company, we have and will continue to incur legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, and other rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC and NASDAQ, have imposed various requirements on public companies, including the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. These rules and regulations have and will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will render some activities more time-consuming and costly. Despite the internal controls and procedures put in place to maintain compliance with securities laws and regulations, our employees may still fail to comply with all SEC disclosure and reporting requirements. Such failure could lead to administrative and civil penalties, criminal penalties, and private litigation with shareholders. The consequences could have a material effect on our ability to effectively market our products and operate our business.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal controls over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. Our testing may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses.\nOur compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. Moreover, if we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner, or if we identify deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by NASDAQ, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\nSome provisions of our third amended and restated charter, bylaws and Tennessee law may inhibit potential acquisition bids that you may consider favorable.\nOur corporate documents contain provisions that may enable our board of directors to resist a change in control of our company even if a change in control were to be considered favorable by you and other shareholders. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nThe authorization of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without shareholder approval;\n\u2022\nAdvance notice procedures required for shareholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of shareholders;\n\u2022\nLimitations on persons authorized to call a special meeting of shareholders;\n\u2022\nA staggered board of directors;\n\u2022\nA restriction prohibiting shareholders from removing directors without cause;\n\u2022\nA requirement that vacancies in directorships are to be filled by a majority of the directors then in office and the number of directors is to be fixed by the board of directors; and\n\u2022\nNo cumulative voting.\nThese and other provisions contained in our third amended and restated charter and bylaws could delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in control of us or our management, including transactions in which our shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current prices, and may limit the ability of shareholders to remove our current management or approve transactions that our shareholders may deem to be in their best interests and, therefore, could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nIn addition, we are subject to control share acquisitions provisions and affiliated transaction provisions of the Tennessee Business Corporation Act, the applications of which may have the effect of delaying or preventing a merger, takeover or other change in control of us and therefore could discourage attempts to acquire our company.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our capital stock, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We do not anticipate paying cash dividends to our shareholders in the foreseeable future. The availability of funds for distributions to shareholders will depend substantially on our earnings.\nSPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nStatements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that are not historical factual statements are \u201cforward-looking statements.\u201d Forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements regarding our intent, belief or expectations, and can be identified by the use of terminology such as \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d\n\u201cplan,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cseek,\u201d \u201canticipate\u201d and other comparable terms or the negative thereof.
