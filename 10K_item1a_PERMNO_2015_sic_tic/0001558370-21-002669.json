{"cik": "1621443", "company": "Zynerba Pharmaceuticals, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nThe risk factors summarized and detailed below could materially harm our business, operating results and/or financial condition, impair our future prospects and/or cause the price of our common stock to decline. These are not all of the risks we face, and other factors not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also affect our business if they occur. A summary of the material risks that may affect our business, operating results and financial condition include, but are not necessarily limited to, those relating to:\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Capital Needs\n\u25cf We have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses in the future.\n\u25cf We currently have no commercial revenue and may never become profitable.\n\u25cf We will require additional capital to fund our operations and if we fail to obtain necessary financing, we will not be able to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates.\n\u25cf With regard to our Australian government research and development income tax incentive refunds, if our research and development expenditures are not deemed to be eligible for the refund, proposed modifications to the tax incentive program are enacted, or the tax incentive program is discontinued by the Australian government, it could have a negative effect on our future cash flows and the funding of future research and development projects.\nRisks Related to our Business\n\u25cf We are largely dependent on the success of our product candidates, which are still in clinical development, and will require significant capital resources and years of clinical development effort.\n\u25cf Because the results of preclinical studies and earlier clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, our product candidates may not have favorable results in our planned clinical trials.\n\u25cf Failures or delays in our clinical trials of Zygel could result in increased costs to us and could delay, prevent or limit our ability to generate revenue and continue our business.\n\u25cf We intend to expend our limited resources to pursue Zygel for certain indications and may fail to capitalize on other product candidates or other indications for Zygel that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\n\u25cf Business interruptions, including any interruptions resulting from COVID-19, could cause a disruption of our operations and may materially and adversely affect our business and financial conditions.\n\u25cf Product shipment delays could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\u25cf Even if we are able to commercialize Zygel, the product may not receive coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, which could harm our business.\n\u25cf If we are unable to develop sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to perform these functions on acceptable terms, we may be unable to generate revenue.\n\u25cf Negative public perception of cannabidiol and cannabis-related products and misconceptions about the nature of our business may generate public controversy.\n\u25cf We face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do.\n\u25cf We are subject to securities class action litigation, which is expensive, can divert management attention, and, if resolved unfavorably, could expose us to significant liabilities.\n\u25cf Failure to protect our information technology infrastructure against cyber-based attacks, network security breaches, service interruptions, or data corruption could significantly disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\n\u25cf The regulatory approval processes of the FDA, the EMA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities are lengthy, time-consuming and inherently unpredictable, and if we are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, our business will be substantially harmed.\n\u25cf We have conducted and are conducting clinical trials for Zygel outside the United States and anticipate conducting additional clinical trials for Zygel outside the United States, and the FDA may not accept data from such trials.\n\u25cf The 2018 Farm Bill and other legislation regarding cannabis may impact our business.\n\u25cf Zygel will be subject to controlled substance laws and regulations; failure to receive necessary approvals may delay the launch of our products and failure to comply with these laws and regulations may adversely affect the results of our business operations.\n\u25cf Increased scrutiny on drug pricing or changes in pricing regulations could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our product candidates, which could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\n\u25cf We have been granted orphan drug status by the FDA for the use of cannabidiol for the treatment of FXS and 22q, but we may be unable to maintain the benefits associated orphan drug status, including market exclusivity, which may cause our revenue, if any, to be reduced.\n\u25cf Serious adverse events or other safety risks could require us to abandon development and preclude, delay or limit approval of our product candidates, or limit the scope of any approved label or market acceptance.\n\u25cf Even though our product candidate has received Fast Track designation, the FDA may not approve it at all or any sooner than other product candidate that does not have Fast Track designation.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\n\u25cf We rely on third parties to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates.\n\u25cf We rely on third-party manufacturers and suppliers to produce preclinical and clinical supplies and intend to rely on third-party manufacturers for commercial supplies of APIs and final dosage forms for Zygel, if approved.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\n\u25cf If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights or if our intellectual property rights are inadequate for our technology and product candidates, our competitive position could be harmed.\n\u25cf Obtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\n\u25cf We may become subject to claims by third parties either asserting that we or our employees have misappropriated their intellectual property or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\n\u25cf We may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our intellectual property, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful and have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\n\u25cf The market price and trading volume of our stock may be volatile.\n\u25cf Some provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\n\u25cf Our certificate of incorporation also provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nGeneral Risks Related to Ownership of Securities\n\u25cf If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting in the future, we may not be able to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\n\u25cf Our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.\nYou should consider carefully the following risks and uncertainties when reading this Annual Report. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline. Although we believe that we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our performance or financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Capital Needs\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses in the future.\nWe are a clinical stage pharmaceutical company dedicated to the development and commercialization of innovative transdermal pharmaceutically-produced cannabinoid treatments for rare and near-rare neuropsychiatric disorders in patients with high unmet medical needs. Since our inception in January 2007, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the development of our product candidates. We have generated significant operating losses since our inception. Our net losses for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were approximately $51.3 million, $32.9 million and $39.9 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $202.2 million. Substantially all of our losses have resulted from expenses incurred in connection with our research and development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future. We anticipate these losses will increase as we continue the research and development of, and clinical trials for, our product candidates. In addition to budgeted expenses, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business. If our product candidates fail in clinical trials or do not gain regulatory approval, or even if approved, fail to achieve market acceptance, we may never become profitable. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods.\nDue to our limited operating history and history of losses, any predictions about our future success, performance or viability may not be accurate.\nWe currently have no commercial revenue and may never become profitable.\nTo date, the only revenue we have generated has been from the receipt of research grants and payments for research services. Our ability to generate revenue and become profitable depends upon our ability to obtain regulatory approval for, and successfully commercialize, our product candidates that we may develop, in-license or acquire in the future.\nEven if we are able to successfully achieve regulatory approval for these product candidates, we do not know what the reimbursement status of our product candidates will be or when any of these products will generate revenue for us, if at all. We have not generated, and do not expect to generate for the foreseeable future, any product revenue, and we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future due to the cost of research and development, preclinical studies and clinical trials and the regulatory approval process for our product candidates. The amount of future losses is uncertain and will depend, in part, on the rate of growth of our expenses.\nOur ability to generate revenue from our product candidates also depends on a number of additional factors, including our ability to:\n\u25cf successfully complete development activities, including the remaining preclinical studies and ongoing and planned clinical trials for our product candidates;\n\u25cf complete and submit NDAs to the FDA and MAAs to the EMA, and obtain regulatory approval for indications for which there is a commercial market;\n\u25cf complete and submit applications to, and obtain regulatory approval from, other foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u25cf manufacture any approved products in commercial quantities and on commercially reasonable terms;\n\u25cf develop a commercial organization, or find suitable partners, to market, sell and distribute approved products in the markets in which we have retained commercialization rights;\n\u25cf achieve acceptance among patients, clinicians and advocacy groups for any products we develop;\n\u25cf obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement from third parties, including government payors; and\n\u25cf set a commercially viable price for any products for which we may receive approval.\nWe are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses, or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to complete the processes described above, we anticipate incurring significant costs associated with commercializing our product candidates.\nWe will require additional capital to fund our operations and if we fail to obtain necessary financing, we will not be able to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nOur operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception. We expect to continue to spend substantial and increasing amounts to conduct further research and development, preclinical testing and clinical trials of our product candidates, to seek regulatory approvals and reimbursement for our product candidates and to launch and commercialize any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $59.2 million in cash and cash equivalents. We believe that cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2020, and the net proceeds of $42.2 million in cash generated between January 1, 2021 and February 9, 2021 from sales under the Controlled Equity OfferingSM Sales Agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Canaccord Genuity, LLC, H.C. Wainwright & Co. LLC and Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., or the 2019 Sales Agreement, are sufficient to fund operations and capital requirements well into the first half of 2024. The progress of Zygel for each target indication is uncertain because it is difficult to predict our spending for our product candidates prior to obtaining FDA approval due to numerous factors, including, without limitation, the rate of progress of clinical trials, the results of preclinical studies and clinical trials for such indication, the costs and timing of seeking and obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals for clinical trials and FDA guidance regarding clinical trials for such indication. Moreover, changing circumstances may cause us to expend cash significantly faster than we currently anticipate, and we may need to spend more cash than currently expected because of circumstances beyond our control. For these reasons, we are unable to estimate the actual funds we will require for development and any approved marketing and commercialization activities. Our future funding requirements, both near and long-term, will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf the initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials for our product candidates;\n\u25cf any change in the clinical development plans or target indications for these product candidates;\n\u25cf the number and characteristics of product candidates that we develop or may in-license;\n\u25cf the terms of any collaboration agreements we may choose to execute;\n\u25cf the outcome, timing and cost of meeting regulatory requirements established by the DEA, the FDA, the EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u25cf the cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing our patent claims and other intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf the timing, outcome and impact of current and future legal proceedings;\n\u25cf the cost of defending intellectual property disputes, including patent infringement actions brought by third parties against us;\n\u25cf the effect of competing product and market developments;\n\u25cf the extent to which health epidemics and other outbreaks of communicable diseases, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, could disrupt our operations or materially and adversely affect our business and financial conditions;\n\u25cf the costs and timing of the implementation of commercial scale manufacturing activities; and\n\u25cf the cost of establishing, or outsourcing, sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for any product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval in regions where we choose to commercialize our products on our own.\nWe cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of one or more of our product candidates or one or more of our other research and development initiatives.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates.\nWe may seek additional capital through a combination of private and public equity offerings, debt financings, strategic partnerships and alliances and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, existing ownership interests will be diluted, and the terms of such financings may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of existing stockholders. Debt financings may be coupled with an equity component, such as warrants to purchase shares, which could also result in dilution of our existing stockholders\u2019 ownership. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and could also result in certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business and may result in liens being placed on our assets and intellectual property. If we were to default on such indebtedness, we could lose such assets and intellectual property. If we raise additional funds through strategic partnerships and alliances and licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nWe receive Australian government research and development income tax incentive refunds. If our research and development expenditures are not deemed to be eligible for the refund, proposed modifications to the tax incentive program are enacted, or the tax incentive program is discontinued by the Australian government, it could have a negative effect on our future cash flows and the funding of future research and development projects.\nOur subsidiary, Zynerba Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd., is incorporated in Australia where we are currently engaged in research and development activities for Zygel. Our subsidiary is eligible to participate in the Australian Federal Government\u2019s Research and Development Tax Incentive program, under which the government provides a cash refund for a portion of eligible research and development expenditures (45% for fiscal years beginning prior to July 1, 2016 and 43.5% for fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 2016) by small Australian entities, which are defined as Australian entities with less than A$20 million in revenue, having a tax loss.\nThe Research and Development Tax Incentive refund is offered by the Australian federal government for eligible research and development purposes based on the filing of an annual application. As part of this program, our subsidiary\napplied for and received cash refunds from the Australian Taxation Office for a percentage of the research and development costs expended by our subsidiary in Australia. Since the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, we have been receiving Research and Development Tax Incentive refunds related to research and development expenditures we make, and we expect to continue to receive refunds under this program for eligible research and development expenditures in Australia.\nCertain research and development expenses incurred outside of Australia may also be eligible for the Australian research and development tax incentive program. To receive a cash refund with respect to such expenses incurred outside of Australia, the expenses must have been for eligible research and development activities, as determined by AusIndustry, and the expenditures must have a scientific link to the Australian activities, be unable to be conducted in Australia and be less than the expenditures for activities conducted in Australia, as determined by the ATO.\nIn December 2018, our subsidiary submitted an Advance Overseas Finding, or AOF, application to AusIndustry for a determination that its activities are eligible research and development activities, which was approved by AusIndustry in July 2019. As a result of this finding, we believe our subsidiary is eligible to receive a cash refund from the ATO for qualifying expenditures related to its research and development activities outside of Australia in 2018, 2019 and 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded $8.3 million as an incentive and tax receivable and recorded a corresponding credit to research and development expense for amounts expected to be received through the AOF for the period January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2019. In June 2020, the ATO informed us that we may not qualify for the AOF program based on their interpretation of certain eligibility requirements. Although we continue to believe that we comply with the relevant conditions of the AOF program that were in place when we received our original approval from AusIndustry, we determined in 2020 that it is no longer probable that the AOF claim will be received. As a result, during the three months ended June 30, 2020, we recorded a full reserve against the AOF receivable. While we will continue to pursue the full refund of our reimbursed expenditures from the ATO, there can be no assurance that all expenditures will be approved for refund.\nTo the extent that some or all of our research and development expenditures are deemed to be \u201cineligible,\u201d then our refunds may decrease or be eliminated. In addition, the Australian government may in the future modify the requirements of, reduce the amounts of the refunds available under, or discontinue the Research and Development Tax Incentive program. Any such change in the Research and Development Tax Incentive program would have a negative effect on our future cash flows.\nChanges in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and ability to achieve profitability.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and Australia. Our effective income tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by a number of factors including changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in tax laws. We regularly assess all of these matters to determine the adequacy of our tax provision which is subject to discretion. If our assessments are incorrect, it could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. There can be no assurance that income tax laws and administrative policies with respect to the income tax consequences generally applicable to us or to our subsidiaries will not be changed in a manner which adversely affects our shareholders.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had U.S. net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards of approximately $129.7 million for U.S. federal income tax and state tax purposes available to offset future taxable income, prior to consideration of annual limitations that may be imposed under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or Section 382. Our NOL carryforwards begin to expire in 2028 if not utilized.\nOur NOL carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. Under Section 382, and corresponding provisions of U.S. state law, if a corporation undergoes an \"ownership change,\" generally defined as a greater than 50% change, by value, in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability\nto use its pre-change U.S. NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research and development tax credits, to offset its post-change income may be limited. We have not performed any analyses under Section 382 and cannot forecast or otherwise determine our ability to derive benefit from our various federal or state tax attribute carryforwards. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change NOL carryforwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of NOLs is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed.\nIn addition, we may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, including in any future offerings, some of which may be outside of our control. If we determine that an ownership change has occurred and our ability to use our NOL carryforwards is materially limited, it would harm our future operating results by effectively increasing our future tax obligations.\nOur federal and state government grants could subject us to audits and could require us to repay funds previously awarded to us.\nPrior to our initial public offering, or IPO, most of our revenue was from the receipt of state and federal research grants. As of December 31, 2020, we have been granted approximately $7.9 million in federal and state research grants (all of which was granted prior to 2016). During 2018, we discontinued research and development studies associated with a previous grant and returned $0.7 million to the grantor in early 2019. Although we are not currently conducting research under any grants, we may be subject to audits by government agencies for previous grants. As part of an audit, these agencies may review our performance, cost structures and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, policies and standards and the terms and conditions of the grant. If any of our expenditures are found to be unallowable or allocated improperly or if we have otherwise violated terms of the grant, we may be required to repay funds previously disbursed. Accordingly, an audit could result in a material adjustment to our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to our Business and Industry\nWe are largely dependent on the success of our product candidates, which are still in clinical development, and will require significant capital resources and years of clinical development effort.\nWe currently do not have any marketed products. Our business depends almost entirely on the successful clinical development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates, and substantial additional clinical development and regulatory approval efforts will be required before we are permitted to commence commercialization, if ever. The clinical trials and manufacturing and marketing of our product candidates will be subject to extensive and rigorous review and regulation by numerous government authorities in the United States, Australia, the European Union, Canada, and other jurisdictions where we intend to test and, if approved, market our product candidates. Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any product candidate, we must demonstrate through preclinical testing and clinical trials that the product candidate is safe and effective for use in each target indication, and potentially in specific patient populations. This process can take many years and may include post-marketing studies and surveillance, which would require the expenditure of substantial resources beyond our existing funds. Of the large number of drugs in development for approval in the United States and the European Union, only a small percentage successfully complete the FDA regulatory approval process or are granted a marketing authorization by the European Commission or the other competent authorities in the EU Member States, as applicable, and are commercialized. Accordingly, even if we are able to obtain the requisite financing to continue to fund our research, development and clinical programs, we cannot assure you that any of our product candidates will be successfully developed or commercialized.\nBecause the results of preclinical studies and earlier clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, Zygel may not have favorable results in our planned clinical trials.\nAny positive results from our preclinical testing and Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials of Zygel may not necessarily be predictive of the results from our ongoing clinical trials for Zygel in patients with FXS, DEE, ASD and 22q, and any\nplanned or proposed additional clinical trials. For example, the results with respect to the ad hoc analysis of the most severely impacted patients in the CONNECT FX trial may not be indicative of positive results in our planned pivotal clinical trial in patients with highly methylated FMR1 gene for 2021 or any other future trials. In addition, our interpretation of clinical data or our conclusions based on our preclinical in vitro and in vivo models may prove inaccurate. Many companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials after achieving positive results in preclinical and early clinical development, and we cannot be certain that we will not face similar setbacks. These setbacks have been caused by, among other things, preclinical findings while clinical trials were underway or safety or efficacy observations in clinical trials, including adverse events. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data can be susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials nonetheless failed to obtain FDA approval or a marketing authorization granted by the European Commission. If we fail to produce positive results in our ongoing or planned clinical trials of Zygel for the treatment symptoms of FXS, DEE, ASD or 22q, the development timeline and regulatory approval and commercialization prospects for Zygel, and, correspondingly, our business and financial prospects, would be materially adversely affected. Given all of these uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on early data.\nWe may experience difficulties in managing our growth and expanding our operations.\nWe have limited resources to carry out objectives for our current and future pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. Since October 2015, we have conducted numerous clinical trials and plan to conduct clinical trials in the future, which is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process. In addition, while we have experienced management and expect to contract out many of the activities related to conducting these programs, we are a small company with only 26 employees and therefore have limited internal resources both to conduct pre-clinical studies and clinical trials and to monitor third-party providers. As our product candidates advance through clinical trials and potential regulatory approval and commercialization, we will need to expand our development, regulatory, commercial and manufacturing operations, either by expanding our internal capabilities or contracting with other organizations to provide these capabilities for us. In the future, we expect to have to manage additional relationships with collaborators or partners, suppliers and other organizations. Our ability to manage our operations and future growth will require us to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures.\nFailures or delays in our clinical trials of Zygel could result in increased costs to us and could delay, prevent or limit our ability to generate revenue and continue our business.\nSuccessful completion of clinical trials is a prerequisite to submitting an NDA to the FDA or an MAA to the EMA. Clinical trials are expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and are uncertain as to outcome. A product candidate can unexpectedly fail at any stage of clinical development. The historic failure rate for product candidates is high due to scientific feasibility, findings related to safety and efficacy, changing regulatory standards and standards of medical care and other variables. In addition, inconclusive results or results that are not deemed statistically significant may cause delays in clinical development or lead us to reevaluate and redesign our clinical development programs. We do not know whether our clinical trials will begin or be completed on schedule, if at all, as the commencement and completion of clinical trials can be delayed or prevented for a number of reasons, including, among others:\n\u25cf delays in reaching or failing to reach agreement on acceptable terms with prospective clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different clinical trial sites;\n\u25cf clinical sites or investigators deviating from trial protocol, failing to conduct the trial in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, or dropping out of a trial or failure of third-party clinical trial managers to meet their contractual obligations or deadlines;\n\u25cf delays or inability in manufacturing or obtaining sufficient quantity or quality of a product candidate or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials due to regulatory and manufacturing constraints;\n\u25cf delay or failure in reaching agreement with the FDA or a foreign regulatory authority on the design of a given trial, or in obtaining authorization to commence a trial;\n\u25cf difficulties obtaining IRB, DEA or comparable foreign regulatory authority, or ethics committee approval to conduct a clinical trial;\n\u25cf challenges in recruiting and enrolling patients to participate in clinical trials, including the size and nature of the patient population, the proximity of patients to clinical trial sites, eligibility criteria for the clinical trial, the nature of the clinical trial protocol, the availability of approved effective treatments for the relevant indication and competition from other clinical trial programs for similar indications;\n\u25cf severe or unexpected toxicities or drug-related side effects experienced by patients in our clinical trials or by individuals using drugs similar to our product candidates;\n\u25cf DEA or comparable foreign regulatory authority-related recordkeeping, reporting or security violations at a clinical trial site, leading the DEA, state authorities or comparable foreign regulatory authorities to suspend or revoke the site\u2019s controlled substance registration and causing a delay or termination of planned or ongoing clinical trials;\n\u25cf delays related to health epidemics and other outbreaks of communicable diseases, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u25cf regulatory concerns with cannabinoid products generally and the potential for abuse of those products;\n\u25cf difficulties retaining patients who have enrolled in a clinical trial who may withdraw due to lack of efficacy, side effects, personal issues or loss of interest and difficulties having subjects return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u25cf ambiguous or negative interim results; or\n\u25cf lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial.\nIn addition, a clinical trial may be suspended or terminated by us, the FDA, an IRB, an ethics committee, a data safety monitoring board or other foreign regulatory authorities overseeing the clinical trial at issue due to a number of factors, including, among others:\n\u25cf failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical trial protocols;\n\u25cf inspection of the clinical trial operations or clinical trial sites by the FDA, the DEA, the EMA or other foreign regulatory authorities that reveals deficiencies or violations that require us to undertake corrective action, including the imposition of a clinical hold;\n\u25cf unforeseen safety issues, including any safety issues that may be identified in our ongoing and planned studies and trials;\n\u25cf adverse side effects or lack of effectiveness; and\n\u25cf changes in government regulations or administrative actions.\nIf our clinical trials fail or are delayed for any of the above reasons, our development costs may increase, our approval process could be delayed and our ability to commercialize our product candidates could be materially harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe intend to expend our limited resources to pursue Zygel for certain indications and may fail to capitalize on other product candidates or other indications for Zygel that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited financial and managerial resources, we are focusing on research programs relating to Zygel for certain indications, which concentrates the risk of product failure in the event Zygel proves to be unsafe or ineffective or inadequate for clinical development or commercialization. In particular, we are studying Zygel in patients with FXS, DEE, ASD and 22q. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications for Zygel that could later prove to have greater commercial potential. We may also deem it advisable to refocus our clinical development programs based on clinical trial results. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on proprietary research and development programs relating to Zygel may not yield any commercially viable products. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for Zygel, we may relinquish valuable rights to Zygel through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to Zygel.\nBusiness interruptions, including any interruptions resulting from COVID-19, could cause a disruption of our operations and may materially and adversely affect our business and financial conditions.\nAll of our employees are located in the U.S., with the exception of one employee located in Australia. In addition to our employees, we rely on third parties in the United States and in various parts of the world to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials, to provide services, including data management, statistical analysis and electronic compilation related to our development of Zygel, and to supply API for Zygel and drug product for our clinical trials. If we, or any of these third-party partners encounter any disruptions to our or their respective operations or facilities, or if we or any of these third-party partners were to shut down for any reason, including by fire, natural disaster, such as a hurricane, tornado or severe storm, power outage, systems failure, labor dispute, pandemic or other unforeseen disruption, then we or they may be prevented or delayed from effectively operating our or their business, respectively. In December 2019, a novel strain of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged in China and has spread to almost every country, including the United States, and could materially and adversely impact our operations or those of our third-party partners. We continue to closely monitor the COVID-19 pandemic, including any potential to impact our clinical development plans and timelines going forward. In response to COVID-19, for our clinical development programs that were ongoing and/or completed during 2020, we implemented multiple measures consistent with the FDA\u2019s guidance on the conduct of clinical trials of medical products during the COVID-19 pandemic, including remote site monitoring and patient visits using telemedicine where needed, direct to patient drug shipment from investigator sites, and local community study related clinical laboratory collection. If necessary, we expect to employ similar measures in any ongoing or planned clinical trials that could affected by the pandemic in the future. Although we did not experience delays in the delivery of\nour topline results for our CONNECT-FX and BRIGHT clinical trials, we did experience a delay in patient recruitment into our INSIPRE trial due to significant travel restrictions in Australia in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAdditionally, continued spread of the coronavirus globally could negatively impact our manufacturing and supply chain for Zygel, our clinical trial timelines, our financial condition and our results of operation. The extent to which the coronavirus and global efforts to contain its spread will impact our operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time, and include the duration, severity and scope of the outbreak and the actions taken to contain or treat the coronavirus outbreak.\nEven if we are able to commercialize Zygel, the product may not receive coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, which could harm our business.\nThe availability of reimbursement by governmental and private payors is essential for most patients to be able to afford expensive treatments. Sales of our product candidates, if approved, will depend substantially on the extent to which the costs of these product candidates will be paid by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration authorities, private health coverage insurers and other third-party payors. If reimbursement is not available, or is available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize Zygel. Even if coverage is provided, the approved reimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow us to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize a sufficient return on our investment.\nIn the United States, the Medicare Modernization Act established the Medicare Part D program and provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class thereunder. The Medicare Modernization Act, including its cost reduction initiatives, could decrease the coverage available for any of our approved products. Furthermore, private payors often follow Medicare in setting their own coverage policies. Therefore, any reduction in coverage that results from the Medicare Modernization Act may result in a similar reduction from private payors.\nThere is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. In the United States, the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by CMS, an agency within HHS, as CMS decides whether and to what extent a new medicine will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare. Private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree.\nThe intended use of a drug product by a physician can also affect pricing. For example, CMS could initiate a National Coverage Determination administrative procedure, by which the agency determines which uses of a therapeutic product would and would not be reimbursable under Medicare. This determination process can be lengthy, thereby creating a long period during which the future reimbursement for a particular product may be uncertain.\nOutside the United States, particularly in EU Member States, the pricing of prescription drugs is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations or the successful completion of HTA procedures with governmental authorities can take considerable time after receipt of marketing authorization for a product. In addition, there can be considerable pressure by governments and other stakeholders on prices and reimbursement levels, including as part of cost containment measures. Certain countries allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various EU Member States and parallel distribution, or arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced EU member states, could further reduce prices. In some countries, we or our collaborators may be required to conduct a clinical trial or other studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of our product candidates to other available therapies in order to obtain or maintain reimbursement or pricing approval. Publication of discounts by third-party payors or authorities may lead to further pressure on the prices or reimbursement levels within the country of publication and other countries. If reimbursement of any product candidate approved for marketing is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to develop sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to perform these functions on acceptable terms, we may be unable to generate revenue.\nWe do not currently have any sales, marketing or distribution capabilities. If Zygel is approved, we will need to develop internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities to commercialize such products, which would be expensive and time-consuming, or enter into collaborations with third parties to perform these services. If we decide to market our products directly, we will need to commit significant financial and managerial resources to develop a marketing and sales force with technical expertise and supporting distribution, administration and compliance capabilities. If we rely on third parties with such capabilities to market our products or decide to co-promote products with collaborators, we will need to establish and maintain marketing and distribution arrangements with third parties, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into such arrangements on acceptable terms or at all. In entering into third-party marketing or distribution arrangements, any revenue we receive will depend upon the efforts of the third parties and there can be no assurance that such third parties will establish adequate sales and distribution capabilities or be successful in gaining market acceptance of any approved product. If we are not successful in commercializing any product approved in the future, either on our own or through third parties, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur product candidates, if approved, may be unable to achieve broad market acceptance and, consequently, limit our ability to generate revenue from new products.\nEven if our product candidates are approved by regulatory approval authorities, our ability to generate significant revenue depends on the acceptance of our product candidates by physicians, patients and payers. The market acceptance of any product depends on a number of factors, including but not limited to awareness of a product\u2019s availability and benefits, the indication statement and warnings approved by regulatory authorities in the product label, continued demonstration of efficacy and safety in commercial use, perceptions by members of the health care community, including physicians, about the safety and effectiveness of our drugs, physicians\u2019 willingness to prescribe the product, reimbursement from third-party payors such as government healthcare systems and insurance companies, the price of the product, pharmacological benefit and cost-effectiveness of our products relative to competing products; the nature of any post-approval risk management plans mandated by regulatory authorities, competition, and the effectiveness of marketing and distribution efforts. Any factors preventing or limiting the market acceptance of our product candidates could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we receive regulatory approvals, we intend to market Zygel in multiple jurisdictions where we have limited or no operating experience and may be subject to increased business and economic risks that could affect our financial results.\nIf we receive regulatory approvals, we may plan to market Zygel in jurisdictions where we have limited or no experience in marketing, developing and distributing our products. Certain markets have substantial legal and regulatory complexities that we may not have experience navigating. We are subject to a variety of risks inherent in doing business internationally, including risks related to the legal and regulatory environment in non-U.S. jurisdictions, including with respect to privacy and data security, trade control laws and unexpected changes in laws, regulatory requirements and enforcement, as well as risks related to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and political, social and economic instability in foreign countries. If we are unable to manage our international operations successfully, our financial results could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, controlled substance legislation may differ in other jurisdictions and could restrict our ability to market our products internationally. Most countries are parties to the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961, which governs international trade and domestic control of narcotic substances, including Cannabis extracts. Countries may interpret and implement their treaty obligations in a way that creates a legal obstacle to us obtaining marketing approval for Zygel in those countries. These countries may not be willing or able to amend or otherwise modify their laws and regulations to permit Zygel to be marketed, or such amendments may take a prolonged period of time. We would be unable to market Zygel in countries with such obstacles in the near future or perhaps at all without modification to laws and regulations.\nNegative public perception of cannabidiol and cannabis-related products and misconceptions about the nature of our business may generate public controversy.\nPolitical and social pressures and adverse publicity could lead to delays in approval of, and increased expenses for, our product candidates. These pressures could also limit or restrict the introduction and marketing of our product candidates. Adverse publicity from Cannabis, or misuse or adverse side effects from Cannabis or other cannabinoid products, or confusion of our products with Cannabis, may adversely affect the commercial success or market penetration achievable by our product candidates. The nature of our business attracts a high level of public and media interest, and in the event of any resultant adverse publicity, our reputation may be harmed.\nAny inability to attract and retain qualified key management and technical personnel would impair our ability to implement our business plan.\nOur success largely depends on the continued service of key management and other specialized personnel. The loss of one or more members of our senior management team or other key employees could delay our research and development programs and materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. The relationships that our team has cultivated within the life sciences industry makes us particularly dependent upon their continued employment with us. Because our management team is not obligated to provide us with continued service, they could terminate their employment or services with us at any time without penalty, subject to providing any required advance notice. We do not maintain key person life insurance policies for any members of our management team. Our future success and growth will depend in large part on our continued ability to attract and retain other highly qualified scientific, technical and management personnel, as well as personnel with expertise in clinical testing, manufacturing, governmental regulation and commercialization. We face competition for personnel from other companies, universities, public and private research institutions, government entities and other organizations.\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do.\nThe development and commercialization of drugs is highly competitive. We compete with a variety of multinational pharmaceutical companies and specialized biotechnology companies, as well as products and processes being developed at universities and other research institutions. Our competitors have developed, are developing or will develop product candidates and processes competitive with our product candidates. Competitive therapeutic treatments include those that have already been approved and accepted by the medical community and any new treatments that may enter the market. We believe that a significant number of products are currently available or are under development and may become commercially available in the future, for the treatment of indications for which we may try to develop product candidates. If Zygel is approved for the indications we are currently pursuing, it will compete with a range of therapeutic treatments that are either in development or currently marketed. See the section titled \u201cBusiness - Competition.\u201d.\nMore established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their greater size, cash flows and institutional experience. Compared to us, many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources. As a result of these factors, our competitors may have an advantage in marketing their approved products and may obtain regulatory approval of their product candidates before we are able to, which may limit our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs that are safer, more effective, more widely used and less expensive than ours, and may also be more successful than us in manufacturing and marketing their products. These advantages could materially impact our ability to develop and, if approved, commercialize Zygel successfully.\nOur product candidates may compete with other FDA approved cannabinoid drugs, including therapies such as GW\u2019s Sativex or Epidiolex. Our product candidates may also compete with medicinal and recreational marijuana, in markets where the recreational and/or medical use of marijuana is legal. There is support in the United States for further legalization of marijuana at both the state and federal levels. In markets where recreational and/or medicinal marijuana is not legal, our product candidates may compete with marijuana purchased in the illegal drug market. We cannot assess\nthe extent to which patients may utilize marijuana obtained illegally for the treatment of the indications for which we are developing Zygel.\nMergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller and other early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These companies compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, management and commercial personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and subject registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities.\nOur use of Zygel in clinical trials and the sale of Zygel, if approved, exposes us to the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims might be brought against us by patients, healthcare providers or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with Zygel. For example, we may be sued if any product we develop allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, including as a result of interactions with alcohol or other drugs, negligence, strict liability, and a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we become subject to product liability claims and cannot successfully defend ourselves against them, we could incur substantial liabilities. In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in, among other things:\n\u25cf withdrawal of patients from our clinical trials;\n\u25cf substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants;\n\u25cf decreased demand for Zygel following marketing approval, if obtained;\n\u25cf damage to our reputation and exposure to adverse publicity;\n\u25cf increased FDA warnings on product labels or increased warnings imposed by the European Commission;\n\u25cf litigation costs;\n\u25cf distraction of management\u2019s attention from our primary business;\n\u25cf loss of revenue; and\n\u25cf the inability to successfully commercialize Zygel, if approved.\nOur current product liability insurance coverage may not be sufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability. If we obtain marketing approval for our product candidates, we intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products; however, we may be unable to obtain product liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms or in adequate amounts. Large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects. The cost of any product liability litigation or other proceedings, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial, particularly in light of the size of our business and financial resources. A product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our share price to decline and, if we are unsuccessful in defending such a claim or claims and the resulting judgments exceed our insurance coverage, our financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nWe are subject to securities class action litigation, which is expensive, can divert management attention, and, if resolved unfavorably, could expose us to significant liabilities.\nWe are subject to securities litigation, which is described further in Part II of this Annual Report in \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies and incorporated by reference in Part I, Item 3 - Legal Proceedings. We have recently reached a negotiated agreement in principle to settle one of these actions, the putative shareholder class action, which is subject to the preliminary and final approval of the court. If the settlement is not approved, this action and any additional litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s resources and attention. In addition, any adverse determination could expose us to significant liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFailure to protect our information technology infrastructure against cyber-based attacks, network security breaches, service interruptions, or data corruption could significantly disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe rely on information technology, telephone networks and systems, including the internet, to process and transmit sensitive electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. We use enterprise information technology systems to record, process, and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory, financial reporting, legal, and tax requirements. Despite the implementation of security measures, our information technology systems, and those of our third-party contractors and consultants, are vulnerable to a cyber-attack, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy or other significant disruption. Any such successful attacks could result in the theft of intellectual property or other misappropriation of assets, or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations. Cyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated and frequent, and our systems could be the target of malware and other cyber-attacks. We have invested in our systems and the protection of our data to reduce the risk of an intrusion or interruption, and we monitor our systems on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats. Nonetheless, our computer systems are subject to penetration and our data protection measures may not prevent unauthorized access. We can give no assurances that these measures and efforts will prevent interruptions or breakdowns. If we are unable to detect or prevent a security breach or cyber-attack or other disruption from occurring, then we could incur losses or damage to our data, or inappropriate disclosure of our confidential information or that of others; and we could sustain damage to our reputation, suffer disruptions to our research and development and incur increased operating costs including increased cybersecurity and other insurance premiums, costs to mitigate any damage caused and protect against future damage, and be exposed to additional regulatory scrutiny or penalties and to civil litigation and possible financial liability. For instance, the loss of preclinical or clinical data could result in delays in our development and regulatory filing efforts and significantly increase our costs.\nWe face risks related to our collection and use of data, which could result in investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines, legislative and regulatory action and negative press about our privacy and data protection practices.\nWe are subject to U.S. data protection laws and regulations (i.e., laws and regulations that address privacy and data security) at both the federal and state levels. The legislative and regulatory landscape for data protection continues to evolve, and in recent years there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data security issues. Numerous federal and state laws, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use, and disclosure of health-related and other personal information.\nIn addition, our business processes some personal data, including some data related to health. When conducting clinical trials, we face risks associated with collecting trial participants\u2019 data, especially health data, in a manner consistent with applicable laws and regulations. We also face risks inherent in handling large volumes of data and in protecting the security of such data. We could be subject to attacks on our systems by outside parties or fraudulent or inappropriate behavior by our service providers or employees. Third parties may also gain access to users\u2019 accounts using stolen or inferred credentials, computer malware, viruses, spamming, phishing attacks or other means, and may use such access to obtain users\u2019 personal data or prevent use of their accounts. Data breaches could result in a violation of applicable U.S. and international privacy, data protection and other laws, and subject us to individual or consumer class action litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings by federal, state and local regulatory entities in the United States and\nby international regulatory entities, resulting in exposure to material civil and/or criminal liability. Further, our general liability insurance and corporate risk program may not cover all potential claims to which we are exposed and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed.\nAs our operations and business grow, we may become subject to or affected by new or additional data protection laws and regulations and face increased scrutiny or attention from regulatory authorities. In the United States, HIPAA imposes, among other things, certain standards relating to the privacy, security, transmission and breach reporting of individually identifiable health information. Certain states have also adopted comparable privacy and security laws and regulations, some of which may be more stringent than HIPAA. Such laws and regulations will be subject to interpretation by various courts and other governmental authorities, thus creating potentially complex compliance issues for us and our future customers and strategic partners. In addition, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA. The CCPA creates individual privacy rights for California consumers and increases the privacy and security obligations of entities handling certain personal data. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. The CCPA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability, and many similar laws have been proposed at the federal level and in other states. In the event that we are subject to or affected by HIPAA, the CCPA or other domestic privacy and data protection laws, any liability from failure to comply with the requirements of these laws could adversely affect our financial condition. In addition, Australia and other countries have also adopted data protection laws and regulations, which impose significant compliance obligation.\nThis risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions and, as we expand our operations domestically and internationally, we may become subject to additional laws in other jurisdictions, such as the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which became effective in May 2018. The GDPR applies extraterritorially and imposes several stringent requirements for controllers and processors of personal data, including, for example, higher standards for obtaining consent from individuals to process their personal data, more robust disclosures to individuals and a strengthened individual data rights regime, shortened timelines for data breach notifications, limitations on retention of information, increased requirements pertaining to special categories of personal data and pseudonymised (i.e., key-coded) data and additional obligations when we contract third-party processors in connection with the processing of the personal data. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with privacy and data protection laws, rules and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. These proceedings or actions may subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity, require us to change our business practices, increase our costs and severely disrupt our business.\nIn addition, under certain circumstances, we may be considered liable for non-compliance by our third-party service providers under the HIPAA, GDPR, the CCPA or other privacy laws and regulations. We could be liable for, or face reputational harm as a result of, their actions if, for example, they fail to comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. These or similar instances of noncompliance by our third-party partners with privacy laws and regulations could have an adverse impact on our reputation and business.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nThe regulatory approval processes of the FDA, the EMA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities are lengthy, time-consuming and inherently unpredictable, and if we are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, our business will be substantially harmed.\nWe are not permitted to market our product candidates in the United States or the European Union until we receive approval of an NDA from the FDA or an MAA from the European Commission, respectively, or in any foreign countries until we receive the requisite approval from such countries. Prior to submitting an NDA to the FDA or an MAA to the EMA for approval of our product candidates, we will need to complete our preclinical studies and clinical trials. Successfully completing our clinical program and obtaining approval of an NDA or MAA is a complex, lengthy,\nexpensive and uncertain process, and the FDA or EMA may delay, limit or deny approval of our product candidates for many reasons, including, among others, because:\n\u25cf we may not be able to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective in treating patients to the satisfaction of the FDA or EMA;\n\u25cf the results of our clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical or clinical significance required by the FDA or EMA for marketing approval;\n\u25cf the FDA or EMA may disagree with the number, design, size, conduct or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u25cf the FDA or EMA may require that we conduct additional clinical trials;\n\u25cf the FDA or EMA or other applicable foreign regulatory authorities may not approve the formulation, labeling or specifications of our product candidates;\n\u25cf the CROs and other contractors that we may retain to conduct our clinical trials may take actions outside of our control that materially adversely impact our clinical trials;\n\u25cf the FDA or EMA may find the data from preclinical studies and clinical trials insufficient to demonstrate that Zygel is safe and effective for their proposed indications;\n\u25cf the FDA or EMA may disagree with our interpretation of data from our preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u25cf the FDA or EMA may not accept data generated at our clinical trial sites or may disagree with us over whether to accept efficacy results from clinical trial sites outside the United States or outside the European Union, as applicable, where the standard of care is potentially different from that in the United States or in the European Union, as applicable;\n\u25cf if our NDAs or MAAs are submitted to the FDA or EMA, as applicable, the regulatory authorities may have difficulties scheduling the necessary review meetings in a timely manner, may recommend against approval of our application or may recommend or require, as a condition of approval, additional preclinical studies or clinical trials, limitations on approved labeling or distribution and use restrictions;\n\u25cf the FDA may require development of a REMS, which would use risk minimization strategies to ensure that the benefits of certain prescription drugs outweigh their risks, as a condition of approval or post-approval, and the European Commission may grant only conditional marketing authorization or impose specific obligations as a condition for marketing authorization, or may require us to conduct post-authorization safety studies;\n\u25cf the FDA, DEA, European Commission or other applicable foreign regulatory agencies may not approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract or DEA or other applicable foreign regulatory agency quotas may limit the quantities of controlled substances available to our manufacturers; or\n\u25cf the FDA, European Commission or other applicable foreign regulatory agencies may change their approval policies or adopt new regulations.\nAny of these factors, many of which are beyond our control, could increase development costs, jeopardize our ability to obtain regulatory approval for and successfully market our product candidates and generate product revenue. Moreover,\nbecause our business is almost entirely dependent upon Zygel, any such setback with regard to Zygel in our pursuit of regulatory approval, in any of our planned indications, could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nWe have conducted and are conducting clinical trials for Zygel outside the United States and anticipate conducting additional clinical trials for Zygel outside the United States, and the FDA may not accept data from such trials.\nFor Zygel, we have reported results from clinical trials which were conducted in Australia and New Zealand. We also have ongoing clinical trials in Australia and New Zealand. We anticipate that we will conduct additional clinical trials for Zygel in countries outside the United States, subject to applicable regulatory approval. We plan to submit NDAs for Zygel to the FDA upon completion of all requisite clinical trials. Although the FDA may accept data from clinical trials conducted outside the United States, acceptance of such study data by the FDA is subject to certain conditions. For example, the clinical trial must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the FDA must be able to validate the data from the clinical trial through an onsite inspection if it deems such inspection necessary. Where data from foreign clinical trials are intended to serve as the sole basis for marketing approval in the United States, the FDA will not approve the application on the basis of foreign data alone unless those data are considered applicable to the U.S. patient population and U.S. medical practice, the clinical trials were performed by clinical investigators of recognized competence, and the data is considered valid without the need for an on-site inspection by the FDA or, if the FDA considers such an inspection to be necessary, the FDA is able to validate the data through an on-site inspection or other appropriate means. In addition, such clinical trials would be subject to the applicable local laws of the foreign jurisdictions where the clinical trials are conducted. If the drug has a potential for abuse, the NDA must include a description and analysis of studies or information related to abuse of the drug, including a proposal for scheduling under the federal Controlled Substances Act, or CSA. A description of any studies related to overdosage is also required, including information on dialysis, antidotes, or other treatments, if known. There can be no assurance the FDA will accept data from clinical trials conducted outside of the United States. If the FDA does not accept any such data, it would likely result in the need for additional clinical trials, which would be costly and time-consuming and delay aspects of our development plan.\nIn addition, the conduct of clinical trials outside the United States could have a significant impact on us. Risks inherent in conducting international clinical trials include:\n\u25cf foreign regulatory requirements that could burden or limit our ability to conduct our clinical trials;\n\u25cf administrative burdens of conducting clinical trials under multiple foreign regulatory schema;\n\u25cf foreign currency fluctuations which could negatively impact our financial condition since certain payments are paid in local currencies;\n\u25cf manufacturing, customs, shipment and storage requirements;\n\u25cf cultural differences in medical practice and clinical research; and\n\u25cf diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries.\nEven if Zygel receives regulatory approval, it may still face future development and regulatory difficulties.\nIf we obtain regulatory approval for Zygel, such approval would be subject to extensive ongoing requirements by the DEA, FDA, EMA and other foreign regulatory authorities, including requirements related to the manufacture, quality control, further development, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, import, export, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and reporting of safety and other post-market information. The safety profile of any product will continue to be closely monitored by the FDA, EMA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities. If the FDA, EMA, DEA or any other comparable foreign regulatory authority becomes aware of new safety information after approval of any of our product candidates, these regulatory authorities may require labeling changes or establishment of\na REMS, impose significant restrictions on a product\u2019s indicated uses or marketing, initiate a change in the drug\u2019s controlled substance schedule, impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies or post-market surveillance, impose a recall or seek to withdraw marketing approval altogether.\nIn addition, manufacturers of therapeutic products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA, the EMA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMP. Further, manufacturers of controlled substances must obtain and maintain necessary DEA and state registrations and registrations with applicable foreign regulatory authorities, and must establish and maintain processes to ensure compliance with DEA and state requirements and requirements of applicable foreign regulatory authorities governing, among other things, the storage, handling, security, recordkeeping and reporting for controlled substances. If we or a regulatory agency discover previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product, the manufacturing facility or us, including requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing. If we, our product candidates or the manufacturing facilities for our product candidates fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may, among other things:\n\u25cf issue untitled letters, letters of administration or warning letters;\n\u25cf mandate modifications to promotional materials or require us to provide corrective information to healthcare practitioners;\n\u25cf require us to enter into a consent decree, which can include imposition of various fines, reimbursements for inspection costs, required due dates for specific actions and penalties for noncompliance;\n\u25cf seek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines;\n\u25cf suspend or withdraw regulatory approval or suspend or revoke the facility\u2019s controlled substance registration;\n\u25cf suspend any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u25cf require us to enter into a Memorandum of Agreement settling administrative or civil claims which can require the implementation of costly compliance programs;\n\u25cf refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to applications filed by us; or\n\u25cf seize or detain products or require us to initiate a product recall.\nThe occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our product candidates and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Non-compliance with requirements regarding safety monitoring or pharmacovigilance, and with requirements related to the development of products for the pediatric population, can also result in significant financial penalties. Similarly, failure to comply with requirements regarding the protection of personal information can also lead to significant penalties and sanctions.\nThe 2018 Farm Bill and other legislation regarding cannabis may impact our business.\nThe 2018 Farm Bill excludes hemp from the definition of marijuana for purposes of the CSA and legalizes the cultivation and commercial sale of hemp in the United States, subject to state regulation and continuing oversight by federal regulatory agencies. Under the 2018 Farm Bill, the term \u2018\u2018hemp\u2019\u2019 means the plant Cannabis sativa L. and any part of that plant, including the seeds thereof and all derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and salts of isomers, whether growing or not, with a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis. This definition of hemp includes only plant derived hemp products. The 2018 Farm Bill declassified\nthis type of hemp as a Schedule I substance and shifted regulatory authority from the DEA to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or USDA. The 2018 Farm Bill outlines a regulatory plan for hemp production and gives primary regulatory authority to the states. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, at least 47 states have enacted legislation to establish industrial hemp cultivation and productions programs to regulate the production of hemp.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture, or USDA, issued an Interim Final Rule, or IFR, on October 31, 2019, establishing the Domestic Hemp Production Program. This program provides the parameters for federal licensing of hemp production, as well as for approval of licensing plans established by states and Native American tribes. Under the IFR, and confirmed by the Final Rule issued by the USDA on January 15, 2021, hemp containing THC levels greater than 0.3 percent remains a Schedule I controlled substance.\nNotwithstanding the removal of plant-derived hemp from the CSA, the 2018 Farm Bill did not alter the FDA\u2019s authority to regulate products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds under the FDC Act. Hemp products that qualify as drugs, food, dietary supplements, veterinary products, and cosmetics will continue to be regulated by FDA under the applicable regulatory frameworks. Following passage of the 2018 Farm Bill, the FDA reaffirmed its enforcement authority and reiterated the requirement that a cannabis product (hemp-derived or otherwise) that is marketed with a claim of therapeutic benefit, or with any other disease claim, be approved by the FDA for its intended use before it may be introduced into interstate commerce. Currently, the FDA treats cannabidiol as a pharmaceutical product, and any product containing cannabidiol must go through the drug approval process and demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the formulation at issue to receive FDA approval. To date, the FDA has approved one such product, Epidiolex, which contains a purified form of cannabidiol, for the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Dravet syndrome and Tuberous sclerosis complex for patients one year of age and older. The FDA has also approved three other compounds that contain synthetic forms of THC or THC-like substances.\nThe 2018 Farm Bill does not directly impact us because the pharmaceutical-grade, synthetically-produced cannabidiol used in the manufacture of Zygel remains a Schedule I controlled substance under the CSA and the development of Zygel remains subject to FDA regulations. Given the continuing uncertainty surrounding future state and federal regulations and the continuing barriers that still exist for cannabis and cannabis-derived compounds, such as cannabidiol, in certain product categories due to FDA regulation, it is unknown what impact the removal of hemp from the CSA, and any resulting commercialization of hemp products, may have on our business.\nZygel will be subject to controlled substance laws and regulations; failure to receive necessary approvals may delay the launch of our products and failure to comply with these laws and regulations may adversely affect the results of our business operations.\nZygel contains controlled substances as defined in the CSA. Controlled substances that are pharmaceutical products are subject to a high degree of regulation under the CSA, which establishes, among other things, certain registration, manufacturing quotas, security, recordkeeping, reporting, import, export and other requirements administered by the DEA. The DEA classifies controlled substances into five schedules: Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have a high potential for abuse, have no currently \u201caccepted medical use\u201d in the United States, lack accepted safety for use under medical supervision, and may not be prescribed, marketed or sold in the United States. Pharmaceutical products approved for use in the United States may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest potential for abuse or dependence and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances. Schedule I and II drugs are subject to the strictest controls under the CSA, including manufacturing and procurement quotas, security requirements and criteria for importation. In addition, dispensing of Schedule II drugs is further restricted. For example, they may not be refilled without a new prescription.\nWhile Cannabis and certain of its derivatives are Schedule I controlled substances, products approved for medical use in the United States that contain Cannabis or Cannabis extracts must be placed in Schedules II - V, since approval by the FDA satisfies the \u201caccepted medical use\u201d requirement. In 2018 the FDA approved Epidiolex, a sesame oil oral solution of cannabidiol and the DEA scheduled Epidiolex to Schedule V. In 2020, the DEA descheduled Epidiolex. If Zygel receives FDA approval, the DEA will make a scheduling determination and place it in a schedule other than Schedule I\nin order for it to be prescribed to patients in the United States. Based on the scheduling decision the DEA made with respect to Epidiolex, if approved by the FDA, we believe, but cannot be certain, that the finished dosage forms of Zygel will be listed by the DEA as a Schedule V controlled substance. However, the DEA must issue an order scheduling the drug within 90 days after FDA approves the drug and DEA receives a scientific and medical evaluation and scheduling recommendation from the HHS. Furthermore, if the FDA, DEA or any foreign regulatory authority determines that Zygel may have potential for abuse, it may require us to generate more clinical data than that which is currently anticipated, which could increase the cost and/or delay the launch of Zygel.\nBecause Zygel contains active ingredients of Cannabis, which are Schedule I substances, to conduct preclinical studies and clinical trials with Zygel in the United States prior to approval, each of our research sites must submit a research protocol to the DEA and obtain and maintain a DEA researcher registration that will allow those sites to handle and dispense Zygel and to obtain the product from our manufacturer. If the DEA delays or denies the grant of a research registration to one or more research sites, the preclinical studies or clinical trials could be significantly delayed, and we could lose and be required to replace clinical trial sites, resulting in additional costs.\nIf for some reason Zygel becomes scheduled as Schedule II or III controlled substance we will also need to identify wholesale distributors with the appropriate DEA registrations and authority to distribute the products to pharmacies and other healthcare providers, and these distributors would need to obtain Schedule II or III distribution registrations. The failure to obtain, or delay in obtaining, or the loss of any of those registrations could result in increased costs to us. If Zygel is a Schedule II drug, pharmacies would have to maintain enhanced security with alarms and monitoring systems, and they must adhere to additional recordkeeping and inventory requirements. This may discourage some pharmacies from carrying the product. Furthermore, state and federal enforcement actions, regulatory requirements, and legislation intended to reduce prescription drug abuse, such as the requirement that physicians consult a state prescription drug monitoring program, may make physicians less willing to prescribe, and pharmacies to dispense, Schedule II products. Further, if Zygel is a Schedule II drug, DEA must establish an annual aggregate quota for the amount that may be manufactured or produced in the United States based on the DEA\u2019s estimate of the quantity needed to meet legitimate medical, scientific, research and industrial needs. This limited aggregate amount that the DEA allows to be produced in the United States each year is allocated among individual companies, which, in turn, must annually apply to the DEA for individual manufacturing and procurement quotas. The quotas apply equally to the manufacturing of the active pharmaceutical ingredient and production of dosage forms. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas a few times per year, and individual manufacturing or procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments for individual companies. A failure by us to obtain adequate quota could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may manufacture the commercial supply of Zygel outside of the United States. If Zygel is approved by the FDA and classified as a Schedule II or III substance, an importer can import for commercial purposes if it obtains from the DEA an importer registration and files an application with the DEA for an import permit for each import. The failure to identify an importer or obtain the necessary import authority, including specific quantities, could affect the availability of Zygel and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, an application for a Schedule II importer registration must be published in the Federal Register, and there is a waiting period for third-party comments to be submitted.\nIndividual states have also established controlled substance laws and regulations. Though state-controlled substance laws often mirror federal law, because the states are separate jurisdictions, they may separately schedule our product candidates as well. While some states automatically schedule a drug based on federal action, other states schedule drugs through rulemaking or a legislative action. State scheduling may delay commercial sale of any product for which we obtain federal regulatory approval and adverse scheduling could have a material adverse effect on the commercial attractiveness of such product. We or our partners must also obtain separate state registrations, permits or licenses in order to be able to obtain, handle, and distribute controlled substances for clinical trials or commercial sale, and failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements could lead to enforcement and sanctions by the states in addition to those from the DEA or otherwise arising under federal law.\nWe currently use contract manufacturers in the United States and Canada to produce the API for Zygel and contract manufacturers in the United Kingdom and Australia to manufacture the drug product for our clinical trials. For Zygel, we have conducted and plan to continue to conduct clinical trials in Australia, New Zealand and the United States. In addition, we may decide to develop, manufacture or commercialize our product candidates in additional countries. As a result, we will also be subject to controlled substance laws and regulations from the TGA in Australia, Health Canada\u2019s Office of Controlled Substances in Canada, the New Zealand Medicines and Medical Device Safety Authority in New Zealand, the Drugs & Firearms Unit (Home Office) of the National Drug Control System in the United Kingdom, and from other regulatory agencies in other countries where we develop, manufacture or commercialize Zygel in the future. We plan to submit NDAs for Zygel to the FDA upon completion of all requisite clinical trials and may require additional DEA approvals at such time as well.\nProduct shipment delays could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe shipment, import and export of Zygel and the API used to manufacture Zygel will require import and export licenses. In the United States, the FDA, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and the DEA; in Canada, the Canada Border Services Agency, Health Canada; in Europe, the EMA and the European Commission; in Australia and New Zealand, the Australian Customs and Board Protection Service, the TGA, the New Zealand Medicines and Medical Device Safety Authority and the New Zealand Customs Service; and in other countries, similar regulatory authorities, regulate the import and export of pharmaceutical products that contain controlled substances. Specifically, the import and export process requires the issuance of import and export licenses by the relevant controlled substance authority in both the importing and exporting country. We may not be granted, or if granted, maintain, such licenses from the authorities in certain countries. Even if we obtain the relevant licenses, shipments of API and our product candidates may be held up or lost in transit, which could cause significant delays and may lead to product batches being stored outside required temperature ranges. Inappropriate storage may damage the product shipment resulting in delays in clinical trials or, upon commercialization, a partial or total loss of revenue from one or more shipments of API or Zygel. A delay in a clinical trial or, upon commercialization, a partial or total loss of revenue from one or more shipments of API or Zygel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure to obtain regulatory approval in jurisdictions outside the United States and the European Union would prevent our product candidates from being marketed in those jurisdictions.\nIn order to market and sell our products in jurisdictions other than the United States and the European Union, we must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The regulatory approval process outside the United States and the European Union generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval or the approval from the European Commission but can involve additional testing. We may need to partner with third parties in order to obtain approvals outside the United States and the European Union. In addition, in many jurisdictions worldwide, it is required that the product be approved for reimbursement before the product can be approved for sale in such jurisdiction. We may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the United States and the European Union on a timely basis, if at all. Even if we were to receive approval in the United States or the European Union, approval by the FDA or the European Commission does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions. Similarly, approval by one regulatory authority outside the United States and the European Union would not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA or the European Commission. We may not be able to file for marketing approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market. If we are unable to obtain approval of our product candidates by regulatory authorities in other foreign jurisdictions, the commercial prospects of those product candidates may be significantly diminished and our business prospects could decline.\nThe Affordable Care Act and any changes in healthcare law may increase the difficulty and cost for us to successfully commercialize our products and affect the prices we may obtain.\nThe United States and many foreign jurisdictions have enacted or proposed legislative and regulatory changes affecting the healthcare system that may affect our ability to profitably sell our product and product candidates, if approved. The\nUnited States government, state legislatures and foreign governments also have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs.\nThe Affordable Care Act was intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms.\nAmong the provisions of the Affordable Care Act that have been implemented since enactment and are of importance to the commercialization of our product and product candidates, if approved, are the following:\n\u25cf an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs or biologic agents;\n\u25cf an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program;\n\u25cf expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the U.S. civil False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;\n\u25cf a Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for a manufacturer\u2019s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;\n\u25cf extension of manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;\n\u25cf a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected;\n\u25cf expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs;\n\u25cf expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;\n\u25cf requirements to report certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals;\n\u25cf a requirement to annually report certain information regarding drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians; and\n\u25cf a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.\nThere have been significant ongoing judicial, administrative, executive and legislative efforts to modify or eliminate the Affordable Care Act. For example, the Tax Act enacted on December 22, 2017, repealed the shared responsibility payment for individuals who fail to maintain minimum essential coverage under section 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code, commonly referred to as the individual mandate. The Trump administration issued executive orders which sought to reduce burdens associated with the Affordable Care Act and modified how it was implemented. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since passage of the Affordable Care Act. The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of an amount greater\nthan $1.2 trillion for the fiscal years 2012 through 2021, triggering the legislation\u2019s automatic reductions to several government programs. These reductions included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to healthcare providers of up to 2.0% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013. Subsequent litigation extended the 2% reduction, on average, to 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. However, pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, the 2% Medicare sequester reductions have been suspended from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.\nThe Affordable Care Act has also been subject to challenges in the courts. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d was repealed by Congress. On December 18, 2019, the Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals held that the individual mandate is unconstitutional and remanded the case to the Texas District Court to reconsider its earlier invalidation of the entire Affordable Care Act. An appeal was taken to the U.S. Supreme Court which heard oral arguments in the case on November 10, 2020. A ruling is expected in 2021.\nFurther changes to and under the Affordable Care Act remain possible, although the new Biden administration has signaled that it plans to build on the Affordable Care Act and expand the number of people who are eligible for subsidies under it. President Biden indicated that he intends to use executive orders to undo changes to the Affordable Care Act made by the Trump administration and would advocate for legislation to build on the Affordable Care Act. It is unknown what form any such changes or any law would take, and how or whether it may affect our business in the future. We expect that changes or additions to the Affordable Care Act, the Medicare and Medicaid programs, changes allowing the federal government to directly negotiate drug prices and changes stemming from other healthcare reform measures, especially with regard to healthcare access, financing or other legislation in individual states, could have a material adverse effect on the healthcare industry.\nWe expect that the Affordable Care Act, as well as other healthcare reform measures that have and may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for our product and product candidates, if approved, and could seriously harm our future revenues. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid, or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain and maintain profitability of our product and product candidates, if approved.\nIncreased scrutiny on drug pricing or changes in pricing regulations could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our product candidates, which could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nDrug pricing by pharmaceutical companies is currently under increased scrutiny and is expected to continue to be the subject of intense political and public debate in the United States. Specifically, there have been U.S. Congressional inquiries and hearings with respect to pharmaceutical drug pricing practices, including the investigation of specific price increases by several pharmaceutical companies. Additionally, several states have passed laws designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, and other states may pursue similar initiatives in the future. We cannot predict the extent to which our business may be affected by these or other potential future legislative or regulatory developments. However, increased scrutiny on drug pricing, negative publicity related to the pricing of pharmaceutical drugs generally, or changes in pricing regulations could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our product candidates, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations.\nWe have been granted orphan drug status by the FDA for the use of cannabidiol for the treatment of FXS and 22q, but we may be unable to maintain the benefits associated orphan drug status, including market exclusivity, which may cause our revenue, if any, to be reduced.\nRegulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the United States and European Union, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals annually in the United States, or, if the disease or condition affects more than 200,000 individuals annually in the United States, if there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug would be recovered from sales in the United States. In the European Union, the EMA\u2019s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union. Additionally, designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the European Union would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the drug.\nIn the United States, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives, such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax credits for certain research and user fee waivers under certain circumstances. In addition, if a product receives the first FDA approval for the drug and indication for which it has orphan drug designation, the product is entitled to seven years of market exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application for the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. In the European Union, orphan drug designation also entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity following drug approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable so that market exclusivity is no longer justified.\nWe may lose orphan drug status if the FDA determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if we are unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. Moreover, orphan drug exclusivity may not effectively protect our product candidates from competition because different drugs can be approved for the same condition. Even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authority can subsequently approve the same drug for the same condition if such regulatory authority concludes that the later drug is clinically superior if it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug nor gives the drug any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process.\nSerious adverse events or other safety risks could require us to abandon development and preclude, delay or limit approval of our product candidates, or limit the scope of any approved label or market acceptance.\nAs is the case with pharmaceuticals generally, it is likely that there may be side effects and adverse events associated with our product candidates\u2019 use. Undesirable side effects caused by our product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. The drug-related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial or result in potential product liability claims. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly.\nMoreover, if our product candidates are associated with undesirable side effects in clinical trials or have characteristics that are unexpected, we may elect to abandon their development or limit their development to more narrow uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective, which may limit the commercial expectations for the product candidate if approved. We may also be required to modify our study plans based on findings in our ongoing clinical trials. It is possible that as we test our product candidates in larger, longer and more extensive clinical trials, or as the use of these product candidates becomes more widespread if they receive regulatory approval, illnesses, injuries, discomforts and other adverse events that were observed in earlier trials, as well as conditions that did not occur or went undetected in previous trials, will be reported by subjects. If such side effects become known later in development or upon approval, if any, such findings may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly.\nEven though our product candidate has received Fast Track designation, the FDA may not approve it at all or any sooner than other product candidate that does not have Fast Track designation.\nWe have received Fast Track designation from the FDA for Zygel for the treatment of behavioral symptoms associated with FXS. Fast Track designation does not ensure that we will receive marketing approval or that approval will be granted within any particular timeframe. We may not experience a faster development, regulatory review or approval process with Fast Track designation compared to conventional FDA procedures. Additionally, the FDA may withdraw Fast Track designation, for reasons such as it comes to believe a drug candidate no longer adequately addresses an unmet medical need. Fast Track designation alone does not guarantee qualification for the FDA\u2019s priority review procedures. If we seek Fast Track designation for other product candidates, we may not receive such a designation from the FDA.\nOur relationships with customers and third-party payors will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with third-party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute our products for which we obtain marketing approval. As a pharmaceutical company, even though we do not and will not control referrals of healthcare services or bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors, certain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients\u2019 rights are and will be applicable to our business. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include the following:\n\u25cf the U.S. federal healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute impacts our marketing practices, educational programs, pricing policies and relationships with healthcare providers or other entities, by prohibiting, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u25cf federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws impose criminal and civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment of government funds (including through reimbursement by Medicare or Medicaid or other federal health care programs), which has been applied to impermissible promotion of pharmaceutical products for off-label uses, or making a false statement or record to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;\n\u25cf HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, among other things, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and also prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;\n\u25cf HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, among other things, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information, and imposes notification obligations in the event of a breach of the privacy or security individually identifiable health information;\n\u25cf the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, being implemented as the Open Payments Program, requires applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to HHS information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members;\n\u25cf numerous federal and state laws and regulations that address privacy and data security, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws (e.g., Section 5 of the FTC Act), govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information;\n\u25cf analogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback laws, false claims laws and privacy and security of health information laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements, claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, or health information; and\n\u25cf certain state laws require pharmaceutical companies to adopt codes of conduct consistent with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government; restrict certain marketing-related activities including the provision of gifts, meals, or other items to certain health care providers; and/or require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and certain other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures.\nComparable laws and regulations exist in the countries within the European Economic Area, or EEA. Although such laws are partially based upon European Union law, they may vary from country to country. Healthcare specific, as well as general European Union and national laws, regulations and industry codes constrain, for example, our interactions with government officials and healthcare professionals, and the collection and processing of personal health data. Non-compliance with any of these laws or regulations could lead to criminal or civil liability.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations, or those of our third-party service providers, are found to be in\nviolation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to not be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.\nAlso, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our internal control policies and procedures may not protect us from reckless or negligent acts committed by our employees, future distributors, licensees or agents. In particular, we do not control the actions of manufacturers and other third-party agents, although we may be liable for their actions. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could result in fines, penalties or prosecution and have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation.\nRecent federal legislation and actions by state and local governments may permit reimportation of drugs from foreign countries into the United States, including foreign countries where the drugs are sold at lower prices than in the United States, which could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe may face competition for Zygel, if approved, from cheaper cannabinoid therapies sourced from foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products. The Medicare Modernization Act contains provisions that may change U.S. importation laws and expand pharmacists\u2019 and wholesalers\u2019 ability to import cheaper versions of an approved drug and competing products from Canada, where there are government price controls. These changes to U.S. importation laws would not take effect unless and until the Secretary of Health and Human Services certifies that the changes will pose no additional risk to the public\u2019s health and safety and would result in a significant reduction in the cost of products to consumers. The Secretary of Health and Human Services issued a final rule in September 2020 allowing the submission of reimportation proposals to the FDA for review and approval. Proponents of drug reimportation, including certain state legislatures, may attempt to pass legislation that would directly allow reimportation under certain circumstances. Approval of importation proposals by the FDA and additional legislation, regulations or other government actions, including actions by the states, could decrease the price we receive for any products that we may develop, including Zygel, and adversely affect our future revenues and prospects for profitability.\nOur employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could subject us to significant liability and harm our reputation.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to comply with DEA, FDA or EMA regulations or similar regulations of other foreign regulatory authorities or to provide accurate information to the DEA, FDA, EMA or other foreign regulatory authorities. In addition, misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to comply with certain manufacturing standards, to comply with U.S. federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations and similar laws and regulations established and enforced by comparable foreign regulatory authorities, to report financial information or data accurately or to disclose unauthorized activities to us. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. We have implemented, and will enforce, a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity, such as employee training on enforcement of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and results of operations, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates.\nWe rely on CROs, clinical data management organizations and consultants to design, conduct, supervise and monitor our preclinical studies and clinical trials. We and our CROs are required to comply with various regulations, including GCP, which are enforced by regulatory agencies, including the FDA, and guidelines of the Competent Authorities of Member States of the EEA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities to ensure that the health, safety and rights of patients are protected in clinical development and clinical trials, and that trial data integrity is assured. Regulatory authorities ensure compliance with these requirements through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. Our reliance on third parties that we do not control does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements. If we or any of our CROs fail to comply with applicable requirements, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA, the European Commission or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with such requirements. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with products produced under cGMP requirements, which mandate, among other things, the methods, facilities and controls used in manufacturing, processing and packaging of a drug product to ensure its safety and identity. Failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat preclinical studies and clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.\nOur CROs are not our employees, and except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such CROs, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our ongoing clinical and preclinical programs. If CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates. As a result, our operations and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed or reduced. In addition, operations of our CROs could be affected by earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, water shortages, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics and other natural or man-made disasters or business interruptions. If their facilities are unable to operate because of an accident or incident, even for a short period of time, some or all of our research and development programs may be harmed or delayed, and our operations and financial condition could suffer.\nBecause we have relied on third parties, our internal capacity to perform these functions is limited. Outsourcing these functions involves risk that third parties may not perform to our standards, may not produce results in a timely manner or may fail to perform at all. In addition, the use of third-party service providers requires us to disclose our proprietary information to these parties, which could increase the risk that this information will be misappropriated. We currently have a small number of employees, which limits the internal resources we have available to identify and monitor our third-party providers. To the extent we are unable to identify and successfully manage the performance of third-party service providers in the future, our business may be adversely affected. Though we carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter similar challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nWe rely on third-party manufacturers and suppliers to produce preclinical and clinical supplies and intend to rely on third-party manufacturers for commercial supplies of APIs and final dosage forms for Zygel, if approved.\nWe rely on third parties to supply the materials for, and manufacture, our research and development, and preclinical and clinical trial supplies and APIs. We do not own manufacturing facilities or supply sources for such components and materials. There can be no assurance that our supply of research and development, preclinical and clinical development\ndrugs and other materials will not be limited, interrupted, restricted in certain geographic regions or of satisfactory quality or continue to be available at acceptable prices. In particular, any replacement of our API manufacturer could require significant effort and expertise because there may be a limited number of qualified manufacturers.\nThe manufacturing process for our product candidates is subject to review by the FDA, EMA, DEA and other foreign regulatory authorities. Suppliers and manufacturers must meet applicable manufacturing requirements and undergo rigorous facility and process validation tests required by regulatory authorities in order to comply with regulatory standards such as cGMP. In addition, our manufacturers must ensure consistency among batches, including preclinical, clinical and, if approved, marketing batches. Demonstrating such consistency may require typical manufacturing controls as well as clinical data. Our manufacturers must also ensure that our batches conform to complex release specifications. Further, manufacturers of controlled substances must obtain and maintain necessary DEA and state registrations and registrations with applicable foreign regulatory authorities, and must establish and maintain processes to ensure compliance with DEA and state requirements and requirements of applicable foreign regulatory authorities governing, among other things, the storage, handling, security, recordkeeping and reporting for controlled substances. In the event that any of our suppliers or manufacturers fails to comply with such requirements or to perform its obligations to us in relation to quality, timing or otherwise, or if our supply of components or other materials becomes limited or interrupted for other reasons, we may be forced to manufacture the materials ourselves, for which we currently do not have the capabilities or resources, or enter into an agreement with another third-party, which we may not be able to do on reasonable terms, if at all. In some cases, the technical skills or technology required to manufacture our product candidates may be unique or proprietary to the original manufacturer and we may have difficulty, or there may be contractual restrictions prohibiting us from, transferring such skills or technology to another third-party and a feasible alternative may not exist. These factors would increase our reliance on such manufacturer or require us to obtain a license from such manufacturer in order to have another third-party manufacture our product candidates. If we are required to change manufacturers for any reason, we will be required to verify that the new manufacturer maintains facilities and procedures that comply with quality standards and with all applicable regulations and guidelines. The delays associated with the verification of a new manufacturer could negatively affect our ability to develop product candidates in a timely manner or within budget.\nWe expect to continue to rely on third-party manufacturers if we receive regulatory approval for any product candidate. To the extent that we have existing, or enter into future, manufacturing arrangements with third parties, we will depend on these third parties to perform their obligations in a timely manner consistent with contractual and regulatory requirements, including those related to quality control and assurance. If we are unable to obtain or maintain third-party manufacturing for product candidates, or to do so on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to develop and commercialize our product candidates successfully. Our or a third party\u2019s failure to execute on our manufacturing requirements could adversely affect our business in a number of ways, including:\n\u25cf an inability to initiate or continue preclinical studies or clinical trials of product candidates under development;\n\u25cf delay in submitting regulatory applications, or receiving regulatory approvals, for product candidates;\n\u25cf loss of the cooperation of a collaborator;\n\u25cf subjecting our product candidates to additional inspections by regulatory authorities; and\n\u25cf in the event of approval to market and commercialize a product candidate, the withdrawal of such approval and/or an inability to meet commercial demands for our products.\nIn addition, our ability to obtain materials from these suppliers could be disrupted if the operations of these manufacturers are affected by earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, cybersecurity breaches, water shortages, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics and other natural or man-made disasters or business interruptions. If their facilities are unable to operate because of an accident or incident, even for a short period of time, some or all of our research and development programs may be harmed or delayed, and\nour operations and financial condition could suffer. Our third-party manufacturers also may use hazardous materials, including chemicals and compounds that could be dangerous to human health and safety or the environment, and their operations may also produce hazardous waste products. In the event of contamination or injury, our third-party manufacturers could be held liable for damages or be penalized with fines in an amount exceeding their resources, which could result in our clinical trials or regulatory approvals being delayed or suspended.\nIf a collaborative partner terminates or fails to perform its obligations under an agreement with us, the commercialization of Zygel, if approved, could be delayed or terminated.\nWe are not currently party to any collaborative arrangements for the commercialization of Zygel, if approved, or similar arrangements, although we may pursue such arrangements before any commercialization of Zygel, if approved. If we enter into future collaborative arrangements for the commercialization of any product candidate or similar arrangements and any of our collaborative partners does not devote sufficient time and resources to a collaboration arrangement with us, we may not realize the potential commercial benefits of the arrangement, and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected. In addition, if any such future collaboration partner were to breach or terminate its arrangements with us, the commercialization of any product candidate could be delayed, curtailed or terminated.\nMuch of the potential revenue from future collaborations may consist of contingent payments, such as payments for achieving regulatory milestones or royalties payable on sales of drugs. The milestone and royalty revenue that we may receive under these collaborations will depend upon our collaborators\u2019 ability to successfully develop, introduce, market and sell new products. In addition, collaborators may decide to enter into arrangements with third parties to commercialize products developed under collaborations using our technologies, which could reduce the milestone and royalty revenue that we may receive, if any. Future collaboration partners may fail to develop or effectively commercialize products using our products or technologies, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights or if our intellectual property rights are inadequate for our technology and product candidates, our competitive position could be harmed.\nOur commercial success will depend in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property protection in the U.S. and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and products. We rely on trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws, and confidentiality and other agreements with employees and third parties, all of which offer only limited protection. We seek to protect our proprietary position by filing and prosecuting patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our novel technologies and products that are important to our business.\nThe patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally are highly uncertain, involve complex legal and factual questions and have in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patents are highly uncertain. The steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to preclude misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights, both inside and outside the United States. Our pending applications cannot be enforced against third parties practicing the technology claimed in such applications unless and until a patent issues from such applications. Further, the examination process may require us to narrow the claims for our pending patent applications, which may limit the scope of patent protection that may be obtained if these applications issue. We do not know whether any of the pending patent applications for any of our product candidates will result in the issuance of patents that protect our technology or products, or if any of our issued patents will effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. The rights already granted under any of our currently issued patents and those that may be granted under future issued patents may not provide us with the proprietary protection or competitive advantages we are seeking. If we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and products, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficient, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or superior to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and\nproducts may be adversely affected. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of inventions made in the course of our development and commercialization activities before it is too late to obtain patent protection on them.\nBecause the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, our issued patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the U.S. and abroad. Such challenges may result in the loss of patent protection, the narrowing of claims in such patents or the invalidity or unenforceability of such patents, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection for our technology and products. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned patents or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions.\nProtecting against the unauthorized use of our patented technology, trademarks and other intellectual property rights is expensive, difficult and may in some cases not be possible. In some cases, it may be difficult or impossible to detect third-party infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, even in relation to issued patent claims, and proving any such infringement may be even more difficult.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nThe U.S. PTO and various foreign national or international patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. Periodic maintenance fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to the U.S. PTO and various foreign national or international patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patent. While an inadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of patent rights include, but are not limited to, failure to timely file national and regional stage patent applications based on our international patent application, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. If we fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering our product candidates, our competitors might be able to enter the market, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may become subject to claims by third parties either asserting that we or our employees have misappropriated their intellectual property or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates, and to use our related proprietary technologies without violating the intellectual property rights of others. We may become party to, or threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our product candidates, including interference or derivation proceedings before the U.S. PTO. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future. If we are found to infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third-party to continue commercializing our product candidates. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Under certain circumstances, we could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the applicable product candidate. In addition, in any such proceeding or litigation, we could be found liable for monetary damages. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. Any claims by third parties that we have misappropriated their confidential information or trade secrets could have a similar negative impact on our business.\nWhile our preclinical studies and clinical trials are ongoing, we believe that the use of Zygel in these preclinical studies and clinical trials falls within the scope of the exemptions provided by 35 U.S.C. Section 271(e) in the United States, which exempts from patent infringement liability activities reasonably related to the development and submission of information to the FDA, or the Clinical Development Exemption. As Zygel progresses toward commercialization, the possibility of a patent infringement claim against us increases. We attempt to ensure that our product candidates and the methods we employ to manufacture them, as well as the methods for their uses we intend to promote, do not infringe other parties\u2019 patents and other proprietary rights. There can be no assurance they do not, however, and competitors or other parties may assert that we infringe their proprietary rights in any event.\nWe are aware of issued U.S. patents and corresponding foreign patents owned by a third-party with claims that are generally directed to a method of treating partial seizures and complex partial seizures by administering cannabidiol to a patient where the cannabidiol is present in an amount to provide a daily dose of at least 400mg. We are also aware of issued U.S. patents owned by such third-party generally directed to methods of treating types of seizures (e.g. atonic, convulsive and focal) in LGS and DS patients by administering cannabidiol with specific purities to a patient, in specified dosing ranges and/or in combination with other drugs. If Zygel is approved by the FDA for the treatment of the indications claimed in these patents and has a label that contains dosing of Zygel with cannabidiol that meets the claimed dosing ranges, purity limitations and/or recited combinations at or above the claimed doses, these patents could be construed to cover Zygel for the claimed indications and such third-party may then seek to enforce its patents by filing patent infringement lawsuits against us. In such lawsuits, we may incur substantial expenses defending our rights to commercialize Zygel for refractory epilepsy, LGS or DS, and in connection with such lawsuits and under certain circumstances, it is possible that we could be required to cease or delay the commercialization of Zygel for refractory epilepsy, LGS or DS, as applicable, and/or be required to pay monetary damages or other amounts, including royalties on the sales of Zygel for refractory epilepsy, LGS or DS. Moreover, such lawsuits may also consume substantial time and resources of our management team and board of directors. The threat or consequences of such lawsuits may also result in royalty and other monetary obligations, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our intellectual property, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful and have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or misappropriate or otherwise violate our intellectual property rights. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of our own intellectual property rights or the proprietary rights of others. Also, third parties may initiate legal proceedings against us to challenge the validity or scope of intellectual property rights we own, or we may initiate legal proceedings against third parties to challenge the validity or scope of their intellectual property rights. These proceedings can be expensive and time consuming. Many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to defend their intellectual property rights than we can. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property. Litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources, which could harm our business and financial results. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent owned by us is invalid or unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable or interpreted narrowly. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of shares of our common stock.\nIf we are not able to adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information, the value of our technology and products could be significantly diminished.\nWe rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary technologies, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our current and former employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers, contract manufacturers, vendors and other advisors to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, we cannot guarantee that we have executed these agreements with each party that may have or have had access to our trade secrets. Any party with whom we or they have executed such an agreement may breach that agreement and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches.\nEnforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they disclose such trade secrets, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor or other third-party, our competitive position would be harmed.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on all of our product candidates throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. Therefore, we have filed applications and/or obtained patents only in key markets such as the United States, Canada, Japan and Europe. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may be able to export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection but where enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products in jurisdictions where we do not have any issued patents and our patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from so competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to pharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. For example, an April 2020 report from the Office of the United States Trade Representative identified a number of countries, including India and China, where challenges to the procurement and enforcement of patent rights have been reported. Several countries, including India and China, have been listed in the report every year since 1989. As a result, proceedings to enforce our patent rights in certain foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business and could be unsuccessful.\nPatent terms may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our product candidates for an adequate amount of time.\nGiven the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. We expect to seek extensions of patent terms in the United States and, if available, in other countries where we are prosecuting patents. In the United States, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the normal expiration of the patent, which is limited to the approved indication (or any additional indications approved during the period of extension). However, the applicable authorities, including the FDA and the U.S. PTO, and any equivalent regulatory authorities in other countries, may not agree with our assessment of whether such extensions are available, and may refuse to grant extensions to our patents, or may grant more limited extensions than we request. If this occurs, our competitors may be able to take advantage of our investment in\ndevelopment and clinical trials by referencing our clinical and preclinical data and launch their product earlier than might otherwise be the case.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business, or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. The following examples are illustrative:\n\u25cf others may be able to make compounds that are the same as or similar to our product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own;\n\u25cf we might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the issued patents or pending patent applications that we own;\n\u25cf we might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our inventions;\n\u25cf others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf it is possible that our pending patent applications will not lead to issued patents;\n\u25cf issued patents that we own may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be held invalid or unenforceable as a result of legal challenges;\n\u25cf our competitors might conduct research and development activities in the United States and other countries that provide a safe harbor from patent infringement claims for certain research and development activities, as well as in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets;\n\u25cf we may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable; and\n\u25cf the patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe market price and trading volume of our stock may be volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. For example, during the period from January 1, 2021 to February 28, 2021, the trading price of our common stock has ranged from $3.23 and $9.00 per share. In addition, the trading volume of our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. In addition to the factors discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this Report, these factors include:\n\u25cf results of clinical trials of Zygel or product candidates of our competitors;\n\u25cf the success of competitive products;\n\u25cf regulatory actions with respect to our product candidates or our competitors\u2019 products and product candidates;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, collaborations or capital commitments;\n\u25cf regulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries;\n\u25cf developments or disputes concerning patent applications, issued patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u25cf the recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u25cf the level of expenses related to our preclinical and clinical development programs;\n\u25cf the results of our efforts to in-license or acquire additional product candidates or products;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u25cf variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u25cf fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\u25cf share price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our common stock;\n\u25cf announcement or expectation of additional financing efforts;\n\u25cf sales of our common stock by us, our insiders or our other stockholders;\n\u25cf changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u25cf market conditions in the pharmaceutical sector; and\n\u25cf general economic, industry and market conditions.\nThese broad market and industry factors may decrease the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nThe stock market in general has, from time to time, experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and decreases in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. We are subject to securities litigation, as described further in Part II of this Annual Report in \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies and incorporated by reference in Part I, Item 3 - Legal Proceedings. This litigation, and any other securities class actions that may be brought against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nInsiders have substantial influence over us and could delay or prevent a change in corporate control.\nOur executive officers, directors, and holders of 5.0% or more of our capital stock collectively beneficially own approximately 9.1% of our voting stock at March 5, 2021. This concentration of ownership could harm the market price of our common stock by:\n\u25cf delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our company;\n\u25cf impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving our company; or\n\u25cf discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company.\nThe interests of this group of stockholders may not always coincide with the interests of our other stockholders and they may act in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders, including by seeking a premium value for their common stock, and might negatively affect the prevailing market price for our common stock.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be our stockholders\u2019 sole source of gain.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. In addition, the terms of any future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be our stockholders\u2019 sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock pursuant to our equity incentive plan could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.\nWe expect that significant additional capital will be needed in the future to continue our planned operations. To raise capital, we may sell substantial amounts of common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock. These future issuances of common stock or common stock-related securities, together with the exercise of outstanding options and any additional shares issued in connection with acquisitions, if any, may result in material dilution to our investors. Such sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock.\nPursuant to our equity incentive plan, our compensation committee is authorized to grant equity-based incentive awards to our directors, executive officers and other employees and service providers. As of March 5, 2021, there were 2,273,070 shares of our common stock available for future grant under our Amended and Restated 2014 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan, as amended, or 2014 Equity Plan. Future equity incentive grants and issuances of common stock under the 2014 Equity Plan may result in material dilution to our stockholders and may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nSome provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our sixth amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders, or remove our current management. These include provisions that:\n\u25cf permit our board of directors to issue up to 10 million shares of preferred stock, with any rights, preferences and privileges as it may designate;\n\u25cf provide that all vacancies on our board of directors, including as a result of newly created directorships, may, except as otherwise required by law, be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum;\n\u25cf require that any action to be taken by our stockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and not be taken by written consent;\n\u25cf provide that stockholders seeking to present proposals before a meeting of stockholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at a meeting of stockholders must provide advance notice in writing, and also specify requirements as to the form and content of a stockholder\u2019s notice;\n\u25cf require that the amendment of certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws relating to anti-takeover measures may only be approved by a vote of 66 2/3% of our outstanding capital stock;\n\u25cf do not provide for cumulative voting rights, thereby allowing the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock entitled to vote in any election of directors to elect all of the directors standing for election; and\n\u25cf provide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the board of directors or by such person or persons designated by a majority of the board of directors to call such meetings.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, who are responsible for appointing the members of our management. Because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring us or merging with us whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not, in general, engage in a business combination with any holder of 15.0% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation also provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur sixth amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty; any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our sixth amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nIf securities or industry analysts publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nGeneral Risks Relating to the Ownership of Securities\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting in the future, we may not be able to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. We are required, under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that results in more than a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act also requires an attestation from our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nOur compliance with Section 404 requires that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. We may not be able to complete our evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion. During the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. We cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting once that firm begins its Section 404 attestation, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the Nasdaq Stock Market, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.\nThese inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements or insufficient disclosures due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nWe have incurred, and will continue to incur, increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management has been required, and will continue to be required, to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company, we have incurred and are continuing to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, and these expenses may increase even more after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the\nDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Protection Act, as well as rules adopted, and to be adopted, by the SEC and Nasdaq Stock Market. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives.\nMoreover, these rules and regulations have substantially increased our legal and financial compliance costs and made some activities more time-consuming and costly. The increased costs have increased our net loss. These rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to maintain sufficient liability insurance coverage for our directors and officers. We cannot predict or estimate the amount or timing of additional costs we may continue to incur to respond to these requirements. The ongoing impact of these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers.", "PERMNO": 15646, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "ZYNE"}
