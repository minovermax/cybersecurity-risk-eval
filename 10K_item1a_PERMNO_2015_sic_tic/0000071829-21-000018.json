Risk Factors\nThe following summarizes the most significant risks to our business. In addition to these risks, we are subject to a variety of risks that affect many other companies generally, as well as other risks and uncertainties that are not known to us as of the date of this Annual Report. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks. Any of these risk factors, either individually or in combination, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition, or prevent us from meeting our profitability or growth objectives. If you hold our securities or are considering an investment in our securities, you should carefully consider the following risks, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report.\nBusiness and Industry Risks\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including actions taken by businesses and governments, resulted in a significant and swift reduction in U.S. and international economic activity. These effects adversely affected the demand for and price of oil and natural gas, as well as the demand for our products and services. The collapse in the demand for oil caused by this unprecedented global health and economic crisis, coupled with oil oversupply, has had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our customers\u2019 demand for the products and services we provide, which in turn could have a material and adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In response to the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, we initiated a number of actions during 2020 aimed at conserving cash and protecting our liquidity, including reducing our workforce and cost structure. However, our business contains high levels of fixed costs, including significant facility and personnel expenses, which limits the effectiveness of such actions.\nWhile the full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak is not yet known, we are closely monitoring the effects of the pandemic on commodity demands, our customers and suppliers activities, as well as our operations and employees. These effects have included, and may continue to include, adverse revenue and profitability effects, delays in planned customer projects, and disruptions to our operations.\nThe extent to which our operating and financial results are affected by COVID-19 will depend on various factors beyond our control, such as the duration and scope of the pandemic; additional actions by businesses and governments in response to the pandemic; and the speed and effectiveness of responses to combat the virus, including the availability and public acceptance of effective treatments or vaccines, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic activity can resume, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. COVID-19, and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic could also give rise to or aggravate other risk factors that we have identified below. COVID-19 could also materially and adversely impact our operating and financial results in a manner that is not currently known to us or that we do not currently consider to present material risks to our operations.\nRisks Related to the Worldwide Oil and Natural Gas Industry\nAlthough we continue to diversify our operations and expand into a variety of end-markets, we derive a significant portion of our revenues from customers in the worldwide oil and natural gas industry; therefore, our risk factors include those factors that impact the demand for oil and natural gas. Spending by our customers for exploration, development, and production of oil and natural gas is based on a number of factors, including expectations of future hydrocarbon demand, energy prices, the risks associated with developing reserves, our customers\u2019 ability to finance exploration and development of reserves, regulatory developments, and the future value of the reserves. Reductions in customer spending levels adversely affect the demand for our products and services, and consequently, our revenues and operating results. The key risk factors that we believe influence the worldwide oil and natural gas markets are discussed below.\nDemand for oil and natural gas is subject to factors beyond our control\nDemand for oil and natural gas, and consequently the demand for our products and services, is highly correlated with global economic growth and in particular by the economic growth of countries such as the U.S., India, China, and developing countries in Asia and the Middle East. Weakness in global economic activity, as well as the global energy transition, could reduce demand for oil and natural gas and result in lower oil and natural gas prices. In addition, demand for oil and natural gas has been and could continue to be impacted by the effects of global health epidemics and concerns (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) and by environmental regulations, including cap and trade legislation, regulation of hydraulic fracturing, and carbon taxes. Our customers in the oil and natural gas industry have been significantly and adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has adversely affected the demand for and price of oil and natural gas. The pace of demand recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic disruption is unknown, and there is significant uncertainty regarding the long-term impact to global oil demand, which will ultimately depend on various factors and consequences beyond our control. Continued weakness or deterioration of the global economy could further reduce our customers\u2019 spending levels and could reduce our revenues and operating results.\nSupply of oil and natural gas is subject to factors beyond our control\nSupply of oil and natural gas can be affected by the availability of quality drilling prospects, exploration success, and the number and productivity of new wells drilled and completed, as well as the rate of production and resulting depletion of existing wells. Oil and natural gas storage inventory levels are indicators of the relative balance between supply and demand. In recent years, advancements in drilling and completion methods and technologies have contributed to a significant increase in oil production, particularly in the U.S. market. Supply can also be impacted by the degree to which individual Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) nations and other large oil and natural gas producing countries are willing and able to control production and exports of hydrocarbons, to decrease or increase supply, and to support their targeted oil price or meet market share objectives. Any of these factors could affect the supply of oil and natural gas and could have a material effect on our results of operations.\nVolatility of oil and natural gas prices can adversely affect demand for our products and services\nVolatility of oil and natural gas prices can also impact our customers\u2019 activity levels and spending for our products and services. The level of energy prices is important to the cash flow for our customers and their ability to fund exploration and development activities. Expectations about future commodity prices and price volatility are important for determining future spending levels. Our customers also take into account the volatility of energy prices and other risk factors by requiring higher returns for individual projects if there is higher perceived risk.\nOur customers\u2019 activity levels, spending for our products and services, and ability to pay amounts owed us could be impacted by the ability of our customers to access equity or credit markets\nOur customers\u2019 activity levels are dependent on their ability to access the funds necessary to develop oil and natural gas prospects and their ability to generate sufficient returns on investments. In recent years, limited access to external sources of funding, including the impacts of the global energy transition and pressures from their investors to generate consistent cash flow has, at times, caused customers in the oil and natural gas industry to reduce their capital spending plans. In addition, a reduction of cash flow to our customers resulting from declines in commodity prices or the lack of available debt or equity financing may impact the ability of our customers to pay amounts owed to us.\nA heightened focus by our customers on cost-saving measures rather than the quality of products and services could reduce the demand for our products and services\nOur customers are continually seeking to implement measures aimed at greater cost savings, which may include the acceptance of lesser quality products and services in order to improve short term cost efficiencies as opposed to total cost efficiencies. This focus has been increased by the COVID-19 pandemic, as customers have and are expected to continue to limit their capital spending plans in light of the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the oil and natural gas industry. The continued implementation of these kinds of cost saving measures could reduce the demand or pricing for our products and services and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Customer Concentration and Reliance on the U.S. E&P Market\nIn 2020, approximately 49% of our consolidated revenues were derived from our 20 largest customers, although no customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues. While we are not dependent on any one customer or group of customers, the loss of one or more of our significant customers could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, approximately 67% of our consolidated revenues were derived from our U.S. operations, including approximately $225 million from the exploration and production market.\nOver the past five years, the North America oil and natural gas market has experienced periods of significant declines which reduced the demand for our services and negatively impacted customer pricing in our North American operations. Due in part to these changes, our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated significantly and may continue to fluctuate in future periods. Because our business has substantial fixed costs, including significant facility and personnel expenses, downtime or low productivity due to reduced demand could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWhile end-market diversification into a variety of non-E&P markets, as well as geographic diversification into the U.S. offshore and foreign E&P markets, is intended over the long term to grow the business and reduce our dependency on the cyclical North American oil and natural gas market, these efforts may not be successful or sufficient to offset this volatility.\nRisks Related to International Operations\nWe have significant operations outside of the U.S., including certain areas of Europe, the Middle East and Africa, as well as Canada. In 2020, our international operations generated approximately 33% of consolidated revenues. Substantially all of our cash balance at December 31, 2020 resides within our international subsidiaries. Algeria represented our largest\ninternational market with our Algerian operations representing 8% of our consolidated revenues for 2020 and 5% of our total assets at December 31, 2020, including 26% of our total cash balance at December 31, 2020.\nIn addition, we may seek to expand to other areas outside the U.S. in the future. International operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties which could negatively impact our results from operations, including:\n\u25aadifficulties and cost associated with complying with a wide variety of complex foreign laws, treaties, and regulations;\n\u25aauncertainties in or unexpected changes in regulatory environments or tax laws;\n\u25aalegal uncertainties, timing delays, and expenses associated with tariffs, export licenses, and other trade barriers;\n\u25aadifficulties enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems;\n\u25aarisks associated with failing to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, export laws, and other similar laws applicable to our operations in international markets;\n\u25aaexchange controls or other limitations on international currency movements, including restrictions on the repatriation of funds to the U.S. from certain countries;\n\u25aasanctions imposed by the U.S. government that prevent us from engaging in business in certain countries or with certain counter-parties;\n\u25aaexpropriation or nationalization of assets;\n\u25aainability to obtain or preserve certain intellectual property rights in the foreign countries in which we operate;\n\u25aaour inexperience in certain international markets;\n\u25aahealth emergencies or pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic);\n\u25aafluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u25aapolitical and economic instability; and\n\u25aaacts of terrorism.\nIn addition, several North African markets in which we operate, including Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, and Algeria have experienced social and political unrest in past years, which, when they occur, negatively impact our operating results and can include the temporary suspension of our operations.\nRisks Related to Operating Hazards Present in the Oil and Natural Gas Industry and Substantial Liability Claims, Including Catastrophic Well Incidents\nWe are exposed to significant health, safety, and environmental risks. Our operations are subject to hazards present in the oil and natural gas industry, such as fires, explosions, blowouts, oil spills, and leaks or spills of hazardous materials (both onshore and offshore), as well as hazards in the electrical utility industry, such as exposure to high voltage electrocution, among other risks. These incidents as well as accidents or problems in normal operations can cause personal injury or death and damage to property or the environment. From time to time, customers seek recovery for damage to their equipment or property that occurred during the course of our service obligations. Damage to our customers\u2019 property and any related spills of hazardous materials could be extensive if a major problem occurs.\nGenerally, we rely on contractual indemnities, releases, limitations on liability with our customers, and insurance to protect us from potential liability related to such events. However, our insurance and contractual indemnification may not be sufficient or effective to protect us under all circumstances or against all risks. In addition, our customers\u2019 changing views on risk allocation together with deteriorating market conditions could force us to accept greater risks to obtain new business or retain renewing business, and could result in us losing business if we are not prepared to take such risks. Moreover, we may not be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate. Any damages caused by our services or products that are not covered by insurance or contractual indemnification, or are in excess of policy limits or subject to substantial deductibles, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. See \u201cRisks Related to the Inherent Limitations of Insurance Coverage\u201d below for additional information.\nRisks Related to Contracts that Can Be Terminated or Downsized by Our Customers Without Penalty\nMany of our fixed-term contracts contain provisions permitting early termination by the customer at their convenience, generally without penalty, and with limited notice requirements. In addition, many of our contracts permit our customers to decrease the products or services without penalty, which could result in a decrease in our revenues and profitability. As a result, you should not place undue reliance on the strength of our customer contracts or the terms of those contracts.\nRisks Related to Product Offering Expansion\nAs a key component of our long-term strategy to diversify our revenue streams generated from both operating segments, we seek to continue to expand our product and service offerings and enter new customer markets with our existing\nproducts. As with any market expansion effort, new customer and product markets require additional capital investment and include inherent uncertainties regarding customer expectations, industry-specific regulatory requirements, product performance, and customer-specific risk profiles. In addition, we likely will not have the same level of operational experience with respect to the new customer and product markets as will our competitors. As such, new market entry is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Ability to Attract, Retain, and Develop Qualified Leaders, Key Employees, and Skilled Personnel\nOur failure to attract, retain, and develop qualified leaders and key employees at our corporate, divisional, or regional headquarters could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, all of our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly-skilled product specialists, technical sales personnel, and service personnel. The market for qualified employees is extremely competitive. If we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel, our ability to compete effectively and grow our business will be severely limited. Also, a significant increase in wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction in our skilled labor force or an increase in our operating costs.\nRisks Related to the Availability of Raw Materials\nOur ability to provide products and services to our customers is dependent upon our ability to obtain raw materials necessary to operate our business.\nOur Industrial Solutions business is highly dependent on the availability of high-density polyethylene (\u201cHDPE\u201d), which is the primary raw material used in the manufacture of our composite mats. The cost of HDPE can vary significantly based on the energy costs of the producers of HDPE, demand for this material, and the capacity or operations of the plants used to make HDPE. Should the cost of HDPE increase, we may not be able to increase our customer pricing to cover our costs, which could result in a reduction in future profitability.\nOur Fluids Systems business is highly dependent on the availability of barite, which is a naturally occurring mineral that constitutes a significant portion of our fluids systems. We currently secure the majority of our barite ore from foreign sources, primarily China and India. The availability and cost of barite ore is dependent on factors beyond our control, including transportation, political priorities, U.S. tariffs, and government-imposed export fees in the exporting countries, as well as the impact of weather and natural disasters. The future supply of barite ore from existing sources may be inadequate to meet the market demand, particularly during periods of increasing world-wide demand, which could ultimately restrict industry activity or our ability to meet our customers\u2019 needs.\nRisks Related to Business Acquisitions and Capital Investments\nOur ability to successfully execute our business strategy will depend, among other things, on our ability to make capital investments and acquisitions which provide us with financial benefits. These acquisitions and investments are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u25aaincorrect assumptions regarding business activity levels or results from our capital investments, acquired operations, or assets;\n\u25aainsufficient revenues to offset liabilities assumed;\n\u25aapotential loss of significant revenue and income streams;\n\u25aaincreased or unexpected expenses;\n\u25aainadequate return of capital;\n\u25aaregulatory or compliance issues;\n\u25aapotential loss of key employees, customers, or suppliers of the acquired company;\n\u25aathe triggering of certain covenants in our debt agreements (including accelerated repayment);\n\u25aaunidentified issues not discovered in due diligence;\n\u25aafailure to complete a planned acquisition transaction or to successfully integrate the operations or management of any acquired businesses or assets in a timely manner;\n\u25aadiversion of management\u2019s attention from existing operations or other priorities;\n\u25aaunanticipated disruptions to our business associated with the implementation of our enterprise-wide operational and financial system; and\n\u25aadelays in completion and cost overruns associated with large capital investments.\nAny of the factors above could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Additionally, the anticipated benefits of a capital investment or acquisition may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected.\nRisks Related to Market Competition\nWe face competition in the Fluids Systems business from larger companies, including Halliburton, Schlumberger, and Baker Hughes, which compete vigorously on fluids performance and/or price. In addition, these companies have broad product and service offerings in addition to their drilling and completion fluids. At times, these larger companies attempt to compete by offering discounts to customers to use multiple products and services, some of which we do not offer. We also have smaller regional competitors competing with us mainly on price and local relationships.\nOur competition in the Industrial Solutions business is fragmented, with many competitors providing various forms of worksite access products and services. More recently, several competitors have begun marketing composite products to compete with our DURA-BASE matting system. While we believe the design and manufacturing quality of our products provide a differentiated value to our customers, many of our competitors seek to compete on pricing. In addition, certain patents related to our DURA-BASE matting system have expired, and competitors may begin offering mats that include features described in those patents. We have additional patents and pending patent applications on improvements to, features of, and uses of the DURA-BASE matting system, but there is no assurance that our competitors will not be able to offer products that are similar to these improvements, features, or uses of the DURA-BASE matting system.\nRisks Related to Technological Developments and Intellectual Property in Our Industry\nThe market for our products and services is characterized by continual technological developments that generate substantial improvements in product performance or service delivery. If we are not successful in continuing to develop new products, enhancements, or improved service delivery that are accepted in the marketplace or that comply with industry standards, we could lose market share to competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur success can be affected by our development and implementation of new product designs and improvements, or software developments, and by our ability to protect and maintain critical intellectual property assets related to these developments. Although in many cases our products are not protected by any registered intellectual property rights, in other cases we rely on a combination of patents and trade secret laws to establish and protect this proprietary technology. While patent rights give the owner of a patent the right to exclude third parties from making, using, selling, and offering for sale the inventions claimed in the patents, they do not necessarily grant the owner of a patent the right to practice the invention claimed in a patent. It may also be possible for a third party to design around our patents. We do not have patents in every country in which we conduct business and our patent portfolio will not protect all aspects of our business. When patent rights expire, competitors are generally free to offer the technology and products that were covered by the patents. Additionally, the trade secret laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary technology in the same manner as the laws of the United States.\nWe also protect our trade secrets by customarily entering into confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers and potential customers, and suppliers. Our rights in our confidential information, trade secrets, and confidential know-how will not prevent third parties from independently developing similar information. Publicly available information (such as information in expired patents, published patent applications, and scientific literature) can also be used by third parties to independently develop technology. We cannot provide assurance that this independently developed technology will not be equivalent or superior to our proprietary technology.\nWe may from time to time engage in expensive and time-consuming litigation to determine the enforceability, scope, and validity of our patent rights. In addition, we can seek to enforce our rights in trade secrets, or \u201cknow-how,\u201d and other proprietary information and technology in the conduct of our business. However, it is possible that our competitors may infringe upon, misappropriate, violate or challenge the validity or enforceability of our intellectual property, and we may not able to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights in the future.\nThe tools, techniques, methodologies, programs, and components we use to provide our services may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. Infringement claims generally result in significant legal and other costs, and may distract management from running our business. Royalty payments under licenses from third parties, if applicable, could increase our costs. Additionally, developing non-infringing technologies could increase our costs. If a license were not available, we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Severe Weather, Natural Disasters, and Seasonality\nWe have significant operations located in market areas around the world that are negatively impacted by severe adverse weather events or natural disasters such as hurricanes in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, fires and typhoons in Australia, droughts across the U.S. and excessive rains outside of the U.S. A potential result of climate change is more frequent or more severe weather events or natural disasters. To the extent such weather events or natural disasters become more frequent or\nsevere, disruptions to our business and costs to repair damaged facilities could increase. Additionally, there are market areas around the world in which our operations are subject to seasonality such as Canada where the Spring \u201cbreak-up\u201d (an industry term used to describe the time of year when the frost comes out of the ground causing the earth to become soft and muddy and strict weight restrictions are implemented by the government to prevent potholes forming on roads) results in a significant slowdown in the oil and natural gas industry and our fluids business each year. Such adverse weather events and seasonality can disrupt our operations and result in damage to our properties, as well as negatively impact the activity and financial condition of our customers.\nIndebtedness Risk\nRisks Related to the Cost and Continued Availability of Borrowed Funds, including Risks of Noncompliance with Debt Covenants\nWe use borrowed funds as an integral part of our long-term capital structure and our future success is dependent upon continued access to borrowed funds to support our operations. The availability of borrowed funds on reasonable terms is dependent on the condition of credit markets and financial institutions from which these funds are obtained. Adverse events in the financial markets, or restrictions on lenders ability or willingness to lend to companies that have significant exposure to customers in the oil and natural gas industry, may significantly reduce the availability of funds, which may have an adverse effect on our cost of borrowings and our ability to fund our business strategy. Our ability to meet our debt service requirements and the continued availability of funds under our existing or future loan agreements is dependent upon our ability to generate operating income and generate sufficient cash flow to remain in compliance with the covenants in our debt agreements. This, in turn, is subject to the volatile nature of the oil and natural gas industry, and to competitive, economic, financial, and other factors that are beyond our control.\nWe fund our ongoing operational needs through a $200.0 million asset-based revolving credit agreement (as amended, the \u201cABL Facility\u201d). In addition, we have $66.9 million of unsecured convertible senior notes (\u201cConvertible Notes\u201d) outstanding as of December 31, 2020 that mature in December 2021. In February 2021, we repurchased $13.0 million of our Convertible Notes leaving $53.9 million outstanding as of February 25, 2021. Borrowing availability under the ABL Facility is calculated based on eligible U.S. accounts receivable, inventory, and, subject to satisfaction of certain financial covenants as described below, composite mats included in the rental fleet, net of reserves and limits on such assets included in the borrowing base calculation. To the extent pledged by us, the borrowing base calculation also includes the amount of eligible pledged cash. The lender may establish such reserves, in part based on appraisals of the asset base, and other limits at its discretion which could reduce the amounts otherwise available under the ABL Facility. Availability associated with eligible rental mats will also be subject to maintaining a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.5 to 1.0 and at least $1.0 million of operating income for the Site and Access Solutions business, each calculated based on a trailing twelve-month period.\nAs of February 25, 2021, our total availability under the ABL Facility was $88.2 million, of which $21.4 million was drawn, resulting in remaining availability of $66.8 million. This availability under the ABL Facility excludes $25.0 million related to eligible rental mats as we failed to satisfy the required minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, as measured on the trailing twelve-month period ended December 31, 2020.\nThe ABL Facility terminates in March 2024; however, the ABL Facility has a springing maturity date that will accelerate the maturity of the ABL Facility to September 1, 2021 if, prior to such date, our Convertible Notes have not been repurchased, redeemed, refinanced, exchanged or otherwise satisfied in full or we have not escrowed an amount of funds, that together with the amount that we establish as a reserve against our borrowing capacity, is sufficient for the future settlement of the Convertible Notes at their maturity. The ABL Facility requires a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.25 to 1.0 calculated based on the trailing twelve-month period ended June 30, 2021 and remaining unused availability of at least $25.0 million to utilize borrowings or assignment of availability under the ABL Facility towards funding the repayment of the Convertible Notes. We expect to satisfy the minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio as required to include eligible rental mats in the borrowing availability under the ABL Facility following the second quarter of 2021 and expect to satisfy the June 30, 2021 ABL Facility requirements to be able to utilize borrowings or assignment of availability under the ABL Facility towards funding the repayment of the Convertible Notes prior to September 1, 2021. If we are unable to satisfy the minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio following the second quarter of 2021, we would further evaluate options, which may include a waiver or amendment to our ABL Facility. Any waiver or amendment to the ABL Facility, if required, would be expected to increase the cost of our borrowings and may impose additional limitations over certain types of activities, and we can give no assurance that we will be able to obtain such amendment or waiver on favorable terms or at all.\nThe ABL Facility is a senior secured obligation, secured by first liens on substantially all of our U.S. tangible and intangible assets, and a portion of the capital stock of our non-U.S. subsidiaries has also been pledged as collateral. The ABL Facility contains customary operating covenants and certain restrictions that limit our ability to, among other things, incur additional debt, incur liens, pay dividends, sell properties or assets, make investments, merge or consolidate with another entity, acquire property or assets, complete affiliate transactions, undertake stock repurchases and make other restricted payments. The ABL Facility also requires a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.0 to 1.0 calculated based on a trailing twelve-month period if availability under the ABL Facility falls below $22.5 million.\nIf we are unable to make required payments under the ABL Facility or other indebtedness of more than $25.0 million, or if we fail to comply with the various covenants and other requirements of the ABL Facility, we would be in default thereunder, which would permit the holders of the indebtedness to accelerate the maturity thereof and proceed against their collateral. In the event any outstanding indebtedness in excess of $25.0 million is accelerated, this could also cause an event of default under our Convertible Notes. The acceleration of any of our indebtedness and the election to exercise any remedies could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition and we may not be able to make all of the required payments or borrow sufficient funds to refinance such indebtedness.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows to repay our indebtedness when due or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional financing. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nRisks Related to Environmental Laws and Regulations\nWe are responsible for complying with numerous federal, state, local, and foreign laws, regulations and policies that govern environmental protection, zoning and other matters applicable to our current and past business activities, including the activities of our former subsidiaries. Failure to remain compliant with these laws, regulations and policies may result in, among other things, fines, penalties, costs, investigation and/or cleanup of contaminated sites and site closure obligations, costs of remedying noncompliance, termination or suspension of certain operations, or other expenditures. We could be exposed to strict, joint and several liability for cleanup costs, natural resource damages and other damages as a result of our conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior operators or other third parties. Private parties may also pursue legal actions against us based on alleged non-compliance with or liability under certain of these laws, rules and regulations. Further, any changes in the current legal and regulatory environment could impact industry activity and the demands for our products and services, the scope of products and services that we provide, or our cost structure required to provide our products and services, or the costs incurred by our customers.\nMany of the markets for our products and services are dependent on the continued exploration for and production of fossil fuels (predominantly oil and natural gas). In recent years, the topic of climate change has received increased attention worldwide. Many scientists, legislators and others attribute climate change to increased levels of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide attributed to the use of fossil fuels, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The Environmental Protection Agency (the \u201cEPA\u201d) and other domestic and foreign regulatory agencies have adopted regulations that potentially limit greenhouse gas emissions and impose reporting obligations on large greenhouse gas emission sources. In addition, the EPA has adopted rules that could require the reduction of certain air emissions during exploration and production of oil and natural gas. More recently, President Biden\u2019s administration officially reentered the United States into the Paris Agreement in February 2021, which requires signatory countries to review and \u201crepresent a progression\u201d in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set greenhouse gas emission reduction goals, every five years beginning in 2020. To the extent that laws and regulations enacted as part of climate change legislation increase the costs of drilling for or producing such fossil fuels, limit or restrict oil and natural gas exploration and production, or reduce the demand for fossil fuels, such legislation could have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability. In addition, there have also been efforts in recent years to influence the investment community, including investment advisors and certain sovereign wealth, pension and endowment funds, promoting divestment of fossil fuel equities and pressuring lenders to limit funding to companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves. Such environmental activism and initiatives aimed at limiting climate change and reducing air pollution could interfere with our business activities, operations, and ability to access capital.\nHydraulic fracturing is a common practice used by E&P operators to stimulate production of hydrocarbons, particularly from shale oil and natural gas formations in the U.S. The process of hydraulic fracturing, which involves the injection of sand (or other forms of proppants) laden fluids into oil and natural gas bearing zones, has come under increased scrutiny from a variety of regulatory agencies, including the EPA and various state authorities. Several states have adopted regulations requiring operators to identify the chemicals used in fracturing operations, others have adopted moratoriums on the use of fracturing, and the State of New York has banned the practice altogether. In addition, concerns have been raised about whether injection of waste associated with hydraulic fracturing operations, or from the fracturing operations themselves, may cause or increase the impact of earthquakes. Studies are in process regarding the correlation between hydraulic fracturing and earthquakes. Although we do not provide hydraulic fracturing services, we offer stimulation chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. Regulations which have the effect of prohibiting, limiting the use, or significantly increasing the costs of hydraulic fracturing could have a material adverse effect on both the drilling and stimulation activity levels of our customers, and, therefore, the demand for our products and services.\nRisks Related to Legal Compliance\nAs a global business, we are subject to complex laws and regulations in the U.S., the U.K. and other countries in which we operate. These laws and regulations relate to a number of aspects of our business, including anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, sanctions against business dealings with certain countries and third parties, the payment of taxes, employment and labor relations, immigration, fair competition, data privacy protections, securities regulation, and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment. The application of these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear and may sometimes conflict. Compliance with these laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in our business practices that could result in reduced revenue and profitability. Non-compliance could also result in significant fines, damages, and other criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions or additional requirements on the conduct of our business and damage our reputation. Certain violations of law could also result in suspension or debarment from government contracts. We also incur additional legal compliance costs associated with global regulations. In some foreign countries, particularly those with developing economies, it may be customary for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, the Italian Criminal Code in Italy, Brazil\u2019s Clean Companies Act, India\u2019s Prevention of Corruption Act and The Companies Act, and Mexico\u2019s Anti-Corruption Law. Although we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors, agents, and business partners will not take action in violation with our internal policies. In the U.S., there have been increasing instances of opioid and other illicit drug usage as well as illegal immigration in certain of the regions in which we operate. While we have taken steps we believe appropriate to ensure that our employees comply with our internal drug and alcohol policy as well as all applicable immigration laws, we cannot assure you there will not be violations in the future. Any such violation of our internal policies or the law could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nFinancial Risks\nRisks Related to the Inherent Limitations of Insurance Coverage\nWhile we maintain liability insurance, this insurance is subject to coverage limitations. Specific risks and limitations of our insurance coverage include the following:\n\u25aaself-insured retention limits on each claim, which are our responsibility;\n\u25aaexclusions for certain types of liabilities and limitations on coverage for damages resulting from pollution;\n\u25aacoverage limits of the policies, and the risk that claims will exceed policy limits; and\n\u25aathe financial strength and ability of our insurance carriers to meet their obligations under the policies.\nIn addition, our ability to continue to obtain insurance coverage on commercially reasonable terms is dependent upon a variety of factors impacting the insurance industry in general, which are outside our control. Any of the issues noted above, including insurance cost increases, uninsured or underinsured claims, or the inability of an insurance carrier to meet their financial obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Income Taxes\nOur future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws, both domestically and internationally, or the interpretation or application thereof. From time to time, U.S. and foreign tax authorities, including state and local governments consider legislation that could increase our effective tax rate. Additionally, the changes in the Presidential administration and Congress increase the uncertainty with regard to potential changes in the U.S. federal tax laws and the interpretation or enforcement of legislation or directives by tax authorities. We cannot determine whether, or in what form, legislation will ultimately be enacted or what the impact of any such legislation could have on our profitability. If such changes to tax laws are enacted, our profitability could be negatively impacted.\nOur future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, or by changes in tax treaties, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof in one or more countries in which we operate. In addition, we are subject to the potential examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and by other tax authorities in jurisdictions where we file tax returns. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that such examinations will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nGeneral Risks\nRisks Related to Cybersecurity Breaches or Business System Disruptions\nWe utilize various management information systems and information technology infrastructure to manage or support a variety of our business operations, and to maintain various records, which may include confidential business or proprietary information as well as information regarding our customers, business partners, employees or other third parties. Failures of or interference with access to these systems, such as communication disruptions, could have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct operations or directly impact consolidated financial reporting. Security breaches pose a risk to confidential data and intellectual property, which could result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of sales and customers, data privacy breaches and damage to our competitiveness and reputation. There can be no assurance that the policies and procedures we have in place, including system monitoring and data back-up processes, to prevent or mitigate the effects of these potential disruptions or breaches will be sufficient to prevent, detect and limit the impact of disruptions or breaches. We do not carry insurance against these risks, although we do invest in security technology, perform penetration tests from time to time, and design our business processes to attempt to mitigate the risk of such breaches. However, there can be no assurance that security breaches will not occur.\nAdditionally, the development and maintenance of these measures requires continuous monitoring as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures evolve. We have experienced cybersecurity threats and incidents, and expect these incidents to continue. While none of the cybersecurity events have been material to date, a successful breach or attack could have a material negative impact on our operations or business reputation, harm our reputation and relationships with our customers, business partners, employees or other third parties, and subject us to consequences such as litigation and direct costs associated with incident response. In addition, these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Compliance with the New York Stock Exchange\u2019s Requirements for the Continued Listing of Our Common Stock\nWe are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the \u201cNYSE\u201d) and are required to meet the NYSE\u2019s continued listing standards, including a requirement that the average closing price of our common stock not be below $1.00 per share over any consecutive thirty trading-day period. During 2020, the price of our common stock had at times closed below $1.00 per share, and we received notice from the NYSE that we were not in compliance with the continued listing standards. Though we regained compliance with the NYSE continued listing standards in December 2020, we cannot assure you that the average closing price of our common stock over a consecutive thirty trading-day period will not fall below $1.00 per share in the future.\nIf we are unable to meet these listing standards and are unable to cure any such non-compliance within the applicable cure period provided by the NYSE, the NYSE could delist our common stock. A delisting of our common stock could negatively impact us by, among other things, reducing the liquidity and market price of our common stock; reducing the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock, which could negatively impact our ability to raise equity financing; limiting our ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future; decreasing the amount of news and analyst coverage of us; and causing us reputational harm with investors, our employees, and parties conducting business with us. A delisting of our common stock would constitute a \u201cfundamental change\u201d under the terms of our Convertible Notes, requiring us to make an offer to repurchase the Convertible Notes at par. There can be no assurance we would have sufficient funds available to us to repurchase the Convertible Notes if required to do so. Failure to repurchase the Convertible Notes also could cause a cross-default under our ABL Facility, which would permit the holders of the indebtedness to accelerate the maturity thereof and proceed against their collateral and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Amended and Restated Bylaws, Which Designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the Sole and Exclusive Forum for Certain Types of Actions and Proceedings that May Be Initiated by Our Stockholders, and the U.S. Federal District Courts in Wilmington County, Delaware as the Exclusive Forum for Securities Act Claims, Which Could Limit Our Stockholders\u2019 Ability to Obtain What Such Stockholders Believe To Be a Favorable Judicial Forum for Disputes with Us or Our Directors, Officers or Other Employees.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, (i) the Delaware Court of Chancery or, if such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, another state or federal court located within the State of Delaware, will be the sole and exclusive forum with respect to (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (b) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former directors, officers, stockholders, employees or agents to us or our stockholders, including a claim alleging the aiding and abetting of such a breach of fiduciary duty, (c) any action asserting a claim against us or any of our current or former directors, officers, stockholders, employees or agents arising out of or relating to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d), our certificate of incorporation or its amended and restated bylaws, (d) any action asserting a claim related to or involving us or any of our directors, officers, stockholders, employees or agents that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the State of Delaware, or (e) any action asserting an \u201cinternal corporate claim\u201d as that term is defined in Section 115 of the DGCL, and (ii) the U.S. Federal District Court in Wilmington County, Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any action arising under the Securities Act. Our choice-of-forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act, and investors cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring an interest in any shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the forum provisions in our amended and restated bylaws. These choice-of-forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that he, she or it believes to be favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our amended and restated bylaws inapplicable or unenforceable with respect to one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and result in a diversion of the time and resources of our management and board of directors.", "PERMNO": 34673, "SIC": 5160, "TIC": "NR"}
