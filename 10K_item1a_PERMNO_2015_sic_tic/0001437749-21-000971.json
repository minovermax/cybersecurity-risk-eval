The risk factors below represent what we believe are the known material risk factors with respect to us and our business. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, operations, industry, financial position or future financial results.\nRisks Related to the Coronavirus Pandemic\nThe coronavirus global pandemic which caused a significant disruption in non-essential retail commerce may continue to have a material adverse impact upon our financial condition and results of operations.\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the current coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) outbreak to be a global pandemic. In response to this declaration and the rapid spread of COVID-19 within the United States, federal, state and local governments throughout the country imposed varying degrees of restriction on social and commercial activity to promote social distancing in an effort to slow the spread of the illness. These measures have had a significant adverse impact upon many sectors of the economy, including non-essential retail commerce. As a result of these circumstances, we temporarily closed our dedicated stores, our manufacturing locations and many of our warehouses. In addition, many of our office personnel were working remotely. By the end of June, we had reopened all of our retail stores that had been temporarily closed. However, continuing logistical challenges faced by the entire home furnishings industry resulting from COVID-related labor shortages and supply chain disruptions have created significant delays in order fulfillment and increasing backlogs as we have not been able to produce and ship at the incoming rate of wholesale and retail orders. Although unable to predict with certainty, we expect gradual decreases in wholesale and retail backlogs over the course of 2021 driven by an anticipated lower rate of future incoming orders coupled with increased manufacturing and shipping activity. If we are unable to reduce the backlogs and increase the speed of order fulfillment it is possible that some of our customers may begin to cancel existing orders and require refunds of deposits, which could have an adverse impact upon our liquidity and results of operations. While the home furnishings industry has fared much better during the pandemic than other sectors of the economy, continued economic weakness and the recent surge in COVID-19 cases coupled with the slow rollout of vaccinations may have an adverse impact upon our business. Furthermore, the economic recession brought on by the pandemic may eventually have an adverse impact on consumer demand for our products. Should these conditions persist for a prolonged period, this may have a continuing material adverse impact on our ultimate financial condition and liquidity.\nRisks Related to Our Retail Operations\nWe face a volatile retail environment and changing economic conditions that may further adversely affect consumer demand and spending.\nHistorically, the home furnishings industry has been subject to cyclical variations in the general economy and to uncertainty regarding future economic prospects. Should the current economic recovery falter or the current recovery in housing starts stall, consumer confidence and demand for home furnishings could deteriorate which could adversely affect our business through its impact on the performance of our Company-owned stores, as well as our licensees and the ability of a number of them to meet their obligations to us.\nOur retail stores face significant competition from national, regional and local retailers of home furnishings, including increasing on-line competition via the internet.\nThe retail market for home furnishings is highly fragmented and intensely competitive. We currently compete against a diverse group of retailers, including national department stores, regional or independent specialty stores, and dedicated franchises of furniture manufacturers. National mass merchants such as Costco also have limited product offerings. We also compete with retailers that market products through store catalogs and the internet. In addition, there are few barriers to entry into our current and contemplated markets, and new competitors may enter our current or future markets at any time. We have also seen increasing competition from retailers offering consumers the ability to purchase home furnishings via the internet for home delivery, and this trend is expected to continue. Our existing competitors or new entrants into our industry may use a number of different strategies to compete against us, including aggressive advertising, pricing and marketing, extension of credit to customers on terms more favorable than we offer, and expansion into markets where we currently operate.\nCompetition from any of these sources could cause us to lose market share, revenues and customers, increase expenditures or reduce prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur licensee-owned stores may not be able to meet their obligations to us.\nWe have a significant amount of accounts receivable attributable to our network of licensee-owned stores. We also guarantee some of the leases of some of our licensees. If these stores do not generate the necessary level of sales and profits, the licensees may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us resulting in additional bad debt expenses and real estate related losses.\nRisks Related to Our Brand and Product Offerings\nFailure to successfully anticipate or respond to changes in consumer tastes and trends in a timely manner could adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nSales of our furniture are dependent upon consumer acceptance of our designs, styles, quality and price. As with all retailers, our business is susceptible to changes in consumer tastes and trends. We attempt to monitor changes in consumer tastes and home design trends through attendance at international industry events and fashion shows, internal marketing research, and communication with our retailers and design consultants who provide valuable input on consumer tendencies. However, such tastes and trends can change rapidly and any delay or failure to anticipate or respond to changing consumer tastes and trends in a timely manner could adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition, certain suppliers may require extensive advance notice of our requirements in order to produce products in the quantities we desire. This long lead time may require us to place orders far in advance of the time when certain products will be offered for sale, thereby exposing us to risks relating to shifts in consumer demand and trends, and any downturn in the U.S. economy.\nOur success depends upon our brand, marketing and advertising efforts and pricing strategies, and if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, or if we are not successful in these efforts and strategies, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nMaintaining and enhancing our brand is critical to our ability to expand our base of customers and drive increased traffic at both Company-owned and licensee-owned stores and to our website. Digital advertising and outreach dominated our marketing expenditures for the majority of fiscal 2020 as we chose to spend less in traditional television and direct mail advertising, and we plan to continue with increased levels of spending on digital advertising and outreach during 2021. We also expect to continue investing in our website to improve the navigation and the ordering capabilities to increase web sales. We cannot provide assurance that our marketing, advertising and other efforts to promote and maintain awareness of our brand will not require us to incur substantial costs. If these efforts are unsuccessful or we incur substantial costs in connection with these efforts, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Material Sourcing and Supply\nOur use of foreign sources of production for a portion of our products exposes us to certain additional risks associated with international operations.\nOur use of foreign sources for the supply of certain of our products exposes us to risks associated with overseas sourcing. These risks are related to government regulation, volatile ocean freight costs, delays in shipments, and extended lead time in ordering. Governments in the foreign countries where we source our products may change their laws, regulations and policies, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, taxation and exchange controls which could make it more difficult to service our customers resulting in an adverse effect on our earnings. We have experienced recent increases in ocean freight costs coupled with a lack of availability of shipping containers resulting in reduced flow of products primarily from Asia. Continued product delays and extended order lead times may adversely affect our ability to service our customers and respond to changes in demand, resulting in the purchase of excess inventory in the face of declining demand, or lost sales due to insufficient inventory in the face of increasing demand, either of which would also have an adverse effect on our earnings or liquidity.\nFluctuations in the price, availability and quality of raw materials could result in increased costs or cause production delays which might result in a decline in sales, either of which could adversely impact our earnings.\nWe use various types of wood, foam, fibers, fabrics, leathers, and other raw materials in manufacturing our furniture. Certain of our raw materials, including fabrics, are purchased both abroad and domestically. Fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of raw materials could result in increased costs or a delay in manufacturing our products, which in turn could result in a delay in delivering products to our customers. For example, lumber prices fluctuate over time based on factors such as weather and demand, which in turn impact availability. Production delays or upward trends in raw material prices could result in lower sales or margins, thereby adversely impacting our earnings.\nRisks Related to Our Logistical Services Operations\nWe may suffer adverse impacts from additional risks associated with the operations of Zenith, a freight transportation and logistics business.\nZenith exposes us to certain risks common to that business, including, but not limited to: difficulties attracting and retaining qualified drivers which could result in increases in driver compensation and could adversely affect our profitability and our ability to maintain or grow our fleet; adverse impacts from unfavorable fluctuations in the availability and price of diesel fuel; increased costs of compliance with, or liability for violation of, existing or future regulations in the highly regulated freight transportation industry; adverse impacts upon Zenith\u2019s results of operations which may result from seasonal factors and harsh weather conditions; and the increased liability inherent with the operation of heavy over-the-road vehicles.\nRisks Related to Electronic Data Processing and Digital Information\nWe rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business. Disruptions in both our primary and back-up systems could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur primary and back-up computer systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, natural disasters and errors by employees. Though losses arising from some of these issues would be covered by insurance, interruptions of our critical business computer systems or failure of our back-up systems could reduce our sales or result in longer production times. If our critical business computer systems or back-up systems are damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them.\nWe may incur costs and reputational harm resulting from security risks we face in connection with our electronic processing, storage and transmission of confidential information.\nWe accept electronic payment cards in our stores and also gather certain personal identifiable information in the processing of our retail sales transactions. We also store and process confidential information pertaining to our employees and other third parties on our networks. We may in the future become subject to claims for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of credit or debit card information. In addition, if there were a disclosure of confidential information provided by, or concerning, our employees, customers or other third parties, including through inadvertent disclosure, unapproved dissemination, or unauthorized access, our reputation could be harmed and we could be subject to civil or criminal liability and regulatory actions. Proceedings related to theft of credit or debit card information may be brought by payment card providers, banks and credit unions that issue cards, cardholders (either individually or as part of a class action lawsuit) and federal and state regulators. Any such proceedings could distract our management from running our business and cause us to incur significant unplanned losses and expenses. Consumer perception of our brand could also be negatively affected by these events, which could further adversely affect our results and prospects.", "PERMNO": 17137, "SIC": 2511, "TIC": "BSET"}
