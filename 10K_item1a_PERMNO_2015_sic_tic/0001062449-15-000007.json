{"cik": "1062449", "company": "BUFFALO WILD WINGS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-23", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThis Form 10-K, including the discussions contained in Items 1 and 7, contains various \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations or beliefs concerning future events. Such statements can be identified by the use of terminology such as \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d \u201cpossible,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201cproject,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cforecast\u201d and similar words or expressions. Our forward-looking statements generally relate to our growth strategy, financial results, sales efforts, franchise expectations, restaurant openings and related expense, and cash requirements. Although we believe there is a reasonable basis for the forward-looking statements, our actual results could be materially different. While it is not possible to foresee all of the factors that may cause actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements, such factors include, among others, the risk factors that follow. Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties and speak only as of the date on which they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement. We believe that all material risk factors have been discussed below.\nFluctuations in chicken wing prices could impact our operating income.\nChicken wings are a primary food product used by our Buffalo Wild Wings restaurants. We work to counteract the effect of the volatility of chicken wing prices, which can significantly change our cost of sales and cash flow, with the introduction of new menu items, effective marketing promotions, focused efforts on food costs and waste, and menu price increases. During 2013, we began selling our wings by portion, providing our guests a more consistent amount of chicken in their orders, and decreasing the impact of yield fluctuations on our cost of sales. We also explore purchasing strategies to reduce the severity of cost increases and fluctuations. The price we pay for chicken wings is determined based on the average of the previous month\u2019s wing market plus mark-up for processing and distribution, but if a satisfactory long-term pricing agreement for chicken wings were to arise, we would consider locking in prices to reduce our price volatility. Chicken wing prices in 2014 averaged 11.9% lower than 2013 as the average price per pound decreased to $1.55 in 2014 from $1.76 in 2013. These prices were historically high in 2012 and decreased in 2013. If there is a significant rise in the price of chicken wings, and we are unable to successfully adjust menu prices or menu mix or otherwise make operational adjustments to account for the higher wing prices, our operating results could be adversely affected. For example, chicken wings accounted for approximately 23%, 25%, and 27% of our cost of sales in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively, with an annual average price per pound of $1.55, $1.76, and $1.97, respectively. A 10% increase in the chicken wing costs for 2014 would have increased cost of sales by approximately $9.5 million. Additional information related to chicken wing prices is included in Item 7 under \u201cResults of Operations.\u201d\nIf we are unable to identify and obtain suitable new restaurant sites and successfully open new restaurants, our revenue growth rate and profits may be reduced.\nWe require that all proposed restaurant sites, whether for company-owned or franchised restaurants, meet our site selection criteria. We may make errors in selecting these criteria or applying these criteria to a particular site, or there may be an insignificant number of new restaurant sites meeting these criteria that would enable us to achieve our planned expansion in future periods. We face significant competition from other restaurant companies and retailers for sites that meet our criteria and the supply of sites may be limited in some markets. Further, we may be precluded from acquiring an otherwise suitable site due to an exclusivity restriction held by another tenant. As a result of these factors, our costs to obtain and lease sites may increase, or we may not be able to obtain certain sites due to unacceptable costs. Our inability to obtain suitable restaurant sites at reasonable costs may reduce our growth.\nTo successfully expand our business, we must open new Buffalo Wild Wings\u00ae restaurants on schedule and in a profitable manner. In the past, we and our franchisees have experienced delays in restaurant openings and we may experience similar delays in the future. Delays in opening new restaurants could hurt our ability to meet our growth objectives, which may affect our results of operations, the expectations of securities analysts and shareholders and thus our stock price. We cannot guarantee that we or our franchisees will be able to achieve our expansion goals. Further, any restaurants that we, or our franchisees, open may not achieve operating results similar or better than our existing restaurants. If we are unable to generate positive cash flow from a new restaurant, we may be required to recognize an impairment loss with respect to the assets for that restaurant. Our ability to expand successfully will depend on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022\nNegotiating acceptable lease or purchase terms for new restaurants;\n\u2022\nCost effective and timely planning, design and build-out of restaurants;\n\u2022\nCreating Guest awareness of our restaurants in new markets;\n\u2022\nCompetition in new and existing markets;\n\u2022\nGeneral economic conditions.\nA security failure in our information technology systems could expose us to potential liability and loss of revenues.\nWe accept credit and debit card payments in our restaurants. A number of retailers have recently experienced actual or potential security breaches in which credit and debit card information may have been stolen, including a number of highly publicized incidents with well-known retailers. The intentional, inadvertent or negligent release or disclosure of data by our company or our service providers could result in theft, loss, fraudulent or unlawful use of customer data could harm our reputation and result in remedial and other costs, fines or lawsuits.\nWe are required to maintain the highest level of Payment Card Industry (\u201cPCI\u201d) Data Security Standard compliance at our company-owned restaurants and corporate offices due to the number of credit card transactions processed in our company-owned restaurants. Failure to maintain our PCI compliance could result in fines or even prohibit our use of payment cards in our company-owned restaurants. While our franchisees are separate businesses, and therefore are subject to different levels of PCI compliance, any failure by our franchisees to maintain their required level of PCI compliance could harm our reputation or result in loss of future royalties.\nShortages or interruptions in the availability and delivery of food and other supplies may increase costs or reduce revenues.\nPossible shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other supplies to our restaurants caused by inclement weather, terrorist attacks, natural disasters such as floods, drought and hurricanes, pandemics, the inability of our vendors to obtain credit in a tightened credit market, food safety warnings or advisories or the prospect of such pronouncements, or other conditions beyond our control could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of items we buy and the operations of our restaurants. Our inability to effectively manage supply chain risk could increase our costs and limit the availability of products critical to our restaurant operations.\nOur restaurants may not achieve market acceptance in the new domestic and international geographic regions we enter.\nOur expansion plans depend on opening restaurants in new domestic and international markets where we or our franchisees have little or no operating experience. We may not be successful in operating our restaurants in new markets on a profitable basis. The success of these new restaurants will be affected by the different competitive conditions, consumer tastes, and discretionary spending patterns of the new markets as well as our ability to generate market awareness of our brands. Sales at restaurants opening in new markets may take longer to reach profitable levels, if at all.\nNew restaurants added to our existing markets may take sales from existing restaurants.\nWe and our franchisees intend to open new restaurants in our existing markets, which may reduce sales performance and guest visits for existing restaurants in those markets. In addition, new restaurants added in existing markets may not achieve sales and operating performance at the same level as established restaurants in the market.\nInvestments in new or emerging brands may not be successful.\nWe have a minority investment in Pie Squared Holdings, operator and franchisor of PizzaRev, a fast-casual pizza restaurant, and a majority investment in Rusty Taco, a fast-casual restaurant specializing in street-style tacos, and intend to invest in these and additional emerging restaurant brands in the future as additional vehicles of growth. If an emerging brand does not succeed, we risk losing all or a substantial portion of our investment in that brand. In addition, our overall long-term growth may be affected by the level of success achieved by these restaurant concepts.\nUnfavorable publicity could harm our business.\nMulti-unit restaurant businesses such as ours can be adversely affected by publicity resulting from complaints or litigation or general publicity regarding poor food quality, food-borne illness, personal injury, food tampering, adverse health effects of consumption of various food products or high-calorie foods (including obesity), or other concerns. Negative publicity from traditional media or on-line social network postings may also result from actual or alleged incidents or events taking place in our restaurants. Regardless of whether the allegations or complaints are valid, unfavorable publicity relating to a number of our restaurants, or only to a single restaurant, could adversely affect public perception of the entire brand. Adverse publicity\nand its effect on overall consumer perceptions of food safety, or our failure to respond effectively to adverse publicity, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nChanges in employment laws or regulation could harm our performance.\nVarious federal and state labor laws govern our relationship with our employees and affect operating costs. These laws include minimum wage requirements, overtime pay, healthcare reform and the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, unemployment tax rates, workers\u2019 compensation rates, citizenship requirements, union membership, and sales taxes. A number of factors could adversely affect our operating results, including additional government-imposed increases in minimum wages, overtime pay, paid leaves of absence and mandated health benefits, mandated training for employees, increased tax reporting and tax payment requirements for employees who receive tips, a reduction in the number of states that allow tips to be credited toward minimum wage requirements, changing regulations from the National Labor Relations Board and increased employee litigation including claims relating to the Fair Labor Standards Act.\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act is a federal law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations and employment. Although our restaurants are designed to be accessible to the disabled, we could be required to make modifications to our restaurants to provide service to, or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons.\nFailure of our internal controls over financial reporting could harm our business and financial results.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that we would prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial statements or fraud. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud. A significant financial reporting failure or material weakness in internal control over financial reporting could cause a loss of investor confidence and decline in the market price of our stock.\nEconomic conditions could have a material adverse impact on our landlords or other tenants in retail centers in which we or our franchisees are located, which in turn could negatively affect our financial results.\nOur landlords may be unable to obtain financing or remain in good standing under their existing financing arrangements, resulting in failures to pay required construction contributions or satisfy other lease covenants to us. In addition other tenants at retail centers in which we or our franchisees are located or have executed leases may fail to open or may cease operations. If our landlords fail to satisfy required co-tenancies, such failures may result in us or our franchisees terminating leases or delaying openings in these locations. Also, decreases in total tenant occupancy in retail centers in which we are located may affect guest traffic at our restaurants. All of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our operations.\nAn impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and consolidated results of operations.\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of identified net assets of business acquired. We review goodwill for impairment annually, or whenever circumstances change in a way which could indicate that impairment may have occurred. Goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level. We identify potential goodwill impairments by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount, which includes goodwill and other intangible assets. The fair value of the reporting unit is calculated using a market approach. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, this is an indication that impairment may exist. We calculate the amount of the impairment by comparing the fair value of the assets and liabilities to the fair value of the reporting unit. The fair value of the reporting unit in excess of the value of the assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of the goodwill. If this amount is less than the carrying amount of goodwill, impairment is recognized for the difference. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indication of impairment exists. Factors may include, among others: a significant decline in our expected future cash flows; a sustained, significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; unanticipated competition; the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit; and slower growth rates. Any adverse change in these factors would have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and negatively affect our financial condition and consolidated results of operations. We compute the amount of impairment by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. We are required to record a non-cash impairment charge if the testing performed indicates that goodwill has been impaired.\nWe evaluate the useful lives of our intangible assets to determine if they are definite- or indefinite-lived. Reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry, legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment, and expected changes in distribution channels), the level of required maintenance expenditures, and the expected lives of other related groups of assets.\nWe cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets. Should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, there could be an adverse effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations.\nWe may experience higher-than-anticipated costs associated with the opening of new restaurants or with the closing, relocating, and remodeling of existing restaurants, which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur revenues and expenses can be impacted significantly by the location, number, and timing of the opening of new restaurants and the closing, relocating, and remodeling of existing restaurants. We incur substantial pre-opening expenses each time we open a new restaurant and incur other expenses when we close, relocate, or remodel existing restaurants. These expenses are generally higher when we open restaurants in new markets, but the costs of opening, closing, relocating or remodeling any of our restaurants may be higher than anticipated. An increase in such expenses could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe may be dependent on franchisees and their success.\nCurrently, approximately 55% of our restaurants are franchised. Franchising royalties and fees represented approximately 6.1%, 6.4%, and 7.4% of our revenues during fiscal 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. Our performance depends upon (i) our ability to attract and retain qualified franchisees, (ii) the franchisees' ability to timely develop restaurants, and (iii) the franchisees\u2019 ability to execute our concept and capitalize upon our brand recognition and marketing. Additionally, the quality of franchised restaurant operations may be diminished if franchisees do not operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements, or if they do not hire and train qualified managers and other restaurant personnel. If franchisees do not adequately operate or manage their restaurants, our image and reputation, and the image and reputation of other franchisees, may suffer materially and system-wide sales could significantly decline.\nWe could face liability from our franchisees.\nVarious state and federal laws govern our relationship with our franchisees and our potential sale of a franchise. If we fail to comply with these laws, we could be liable for damages to franchisees and fines or other penalties. A franchisee or government agency may bring legal action against us based on the franchisee/franchisor relationship. Also, under the franchise business model, we may face claims and liabilities based on vicarious or joint-employer liability theories. All such legal actions not only could result in changes to laws, making it more difficult to appropriately support our franchisees and, consequently, impacting our performance, but, also, such legal actions could result in expensive litigation with our franchisees or government agencies that could adversely affect both our profits and our important relations with our franchisees. In addition, other regulatory or legal developments may result in changes to laws that could negatively impact the franchise business model and, accordingly, our profits.\nWe may be unable to compete effectively in the restaurant industry.\nThe restaurant industry is intensely competitive. We believe we compete primarily with regional and local sports bars, casual dining and quick casual establishments, and to a lesser extent, quick service wing-based take-out concepts and quick service restaurants. In addition, independent owners of local or regional establishments may enter the wing-based or sports bar restaurant business without significant barriers to entry and such establishments may provide price competition for our restaurants. Competition in the casual dining, quick casual and quick service segments of the restaurant industry is expected to remain intense with respect to price, service, location, concept and the type and quality of food. We also face intense competition for real estate sites, qualified management personnel, and hourly restaurant staff.\nOur success depends substantially on the value of our brands and our reputation for offering guests an unparalleled Guest experience.\nWe believe we have built a strong reputation for the quality and breadth of our menu items as part of the total experience that guests enjoy in our restaurants. We believe we must protect and grow the value of our brands to continue to be successful in the future. Any incident that erodes consumer trust in or affinity for our brands could significantly reduce their value. If\nconsumers perceive or experience a reduction in food quality, service, or ambiance, or in any way believe we failed to deliver a consistently positive experience, our brand value could suffer.\nOur inability to successfully and sufficiently raise menu prices could result in a decline in profitability.\nWe utilize menu price increases to help offset cost increases, including increased cost for commodities, minimum wages, employee benefits, insurance arrangements, construction, utilities, and other key operating costs. If our selection and amount of menu price increases are not accepted by consumers and reduce guest traffic, or are insufficient to counter increased costs, our financial results could be harmed.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate due to the timing of special events and other factors, including the recognition of impairment losses.\nOur quarterly operating results depend, in part, on special events, such as the Super Bowl\u00ae and other sporting events viewed by our guests in our Buffalo Wild Wings restaurants such as the NFL, MLB, NBA, NHL, and NCAA. Interruptions in the viewing of these professional and collegiate sporting league events due to strikes, lockouts, or labor disputes may impact our results. Additionally, our results are subject to fluctuations based on the dates of sporting events and their availability for viewing through broadcast, satellite and cable networks. Historically, sales in most of our restaurants have been higher during fall and winter months based on the relative popularity and extent of national, regional and local sporting and other events. Further, our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly because of other factors, including:\n\u2022\nFluctuations in food costs, particularly chicken wings;\n\u2022\nThe timing of new restaurant openings, which may impact margins due to the related preopening costs and initially higher restaurant level operating expense ratios;\n\u2022\nPotential distraction or unusual expenses associated with our expansion into international markets;\n\u2022\nOur ability to operate effectively in new markets domestically and internationally in which we or our franchisees have limited operating experience;\n\u2022\nLabor availability and costs for hourly and management personnel;\n\u2022\nChanges in competitive factors;\n\u2022\nDisruption in supplies;\n\u2022\nGeneral economic conditions, consumer confidence, and fluctuations in discretionary spending;\n\u2022\nClaims experience for self-insurance programs;\n\u2022\nIncreases or decreases in labor or other variable expenses;\n\u2022\nThe impact of inclement weather, natural disasters, and other calamities;\n\u2022\nFluctuations in interest rates;\n\u2022\nThe timing and amount of asset impairment loss and restaurant closing charges; and\n\u2022\nTax expenses and other non-operating costs.\nAs a result of the factors discussed above, our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate significantly. Accordingly, results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year. These fluctuations may cause future operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and shareholders. In that event, the price of our common stock would likely decrease.\nWe may not be able to attract and retain qualified Team Members and key executives to operate and manage our business.\nOur success and the success of our individual restaurants and business depends on our ability to attract, motivate, develop and retain a sufficient number of qualified key executives and restaurant employees, including restaurant managers, and hourly Team Members. The inability to recruit, develop and retain these individuals may delay the planned openings of new restaurants or result in high employee turnover in existing restaurants, thus increasing the cost to efficiently operate our restaurants. This could inhibit our expansion plans and business performance and, to the extent that a labor shortage may force us to pay higher wages, harm our profitability. The loss of any of our key executive officers could jeopardize our ability to meet our financial targets.\nWe may not be able to obtain and maintain licenses and permits necessary to operate our restaurants.\nThe restaurant industry is subject to various federal, state, and local government regulations, including those relating to the sale of food and alcoholic beverages. In addition, we are subject to gaming regulations with respect to our gaming operations within our nine company-owned restaurants in Las Vegas. The failure to obtain and maintain these licenses, permits and approvals, including food, liquor and gaming licenses, could adversely affect our operating results. Difficulties or failure to obtain the required licenses and approvals could delay or result in our decision to cancel the opening of new restaurants. Local authorities may revoke, suspend, or deny renewal of our food and liquor licenses if they determine that our conduct violates applicable regulations.\nThe sale of alcoholic beverages at our restaurants subjects us to additional regulations and potential liability.\nBecause our restaurants sell alcoholic beverages, we are required to comply with the alcohol licensing requirements of the federal government, states and municipalities where our restaurants are located. Alcoholic beverage control regulations require applications to state authorities and, in certain locations, county and municipal authorities for a license and permit to sell alcoholic beverages on the premises and to provide service for extended hours and on Sundays. Typically, the licenses are renewed annually and may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time. Alcoholic beverage control regulations relate to numerous aspects of the daily operations of the restaurants, including minimum age of guests and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventory control and handling, storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. If we fail to comply with federal, state or local regulations, our licenses may be revoked and we may be forced to terminate the sale of alcoholic beverages at one or more of our restaurants. Further, growing movements to change laws relating to alcohol may result in a decline in alcohol consumption at our restaurants or increase the number of dram shop claims made against us, either of which may negatively impact operations or result in the loss of liquor licenses.\nIn certain states we are subject to \u201cdram shop\u201d statutes, which generally allow a person injured by an intoxicated person the right to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated person. Some dram shop litigation against restaurant companies has resulted in significant judgments, including punitive damages.\nChanges in consumer preferences or discretionary consumer spending could harm our performance.\nThe success of Buffalo Wild Wings depends, in part, upon the continued popularity of our Buffalo, New York-style chicken wings, our boneless wings, other food and beverage items, and appeal of sports bars and casual dining restaurants. We also depend on trends toward consumers eating away from home. Shifts in these consumer preferences could negatively affect our future profitability. Such shifts could be based on health concerns related to the cholesterol, carbohydrate, fat, calorie, or salt content of certain food items, including items featured on our menu. Negative publicity over the health aspects of such food items may adversely affect consumer demand for our menu items and could result in a decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants, which could materially harm our business. In addition, we will be required to disclose calorie counts for all food items on our menus, due to federal regulations, and this may have an effect on consumers\u2019 eating habits. Other federal regulations could follow this pattern. In addition, our success depends to a significant extent on numerous factors affecting discretionary consumer spending, including economic conditions, disposable consumer income and consumer confidence. A decline in consumer spending or in economic conditions could reduce guest traffic or impose practical limits on pricing, either of which could harm our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flow.\nA regional or global health pandemic could severely affect our business.\nA health pandemic is a disease outbreak that spreads rapidly and widely by infection and affects many individuals in an area or population at the same time. If a regional or global health pandemic were to occur, depending upon its duration and severity, our business could be severely affected. We have positioned our brand as a place where people can gather together.\nCustomers might avoid public gathering places in the event of a health pandemic, and local, regional or national governments might limit or ban public gatherings to halt or delay the spread of disease. A regional or global health pandemic might also adversely impact our business by disrupting or delaying production and delivery of materials and products in its supply chain and by causing staffing shortages in our restaurants. The impact of a health pandemic might be disproportionately greater than on other companies that depend less on the gathering of people together for the sale or use of their products and services.\nThe acquisition of existing restaurants from our franchisees or other acquisitions may have unanticipated consequences that could harm our business and our financial condition.\nWe may selectively acquire existing restaurants from our franchisees or other restaurants. To do so, we would need to identify suitable acquisition candidates, negotiate acceptable acquisition terms and obtain appropriate financing. Any acquisition that we pursue, whether or not successfully completed, may involve risks, including:\n\u2022\nMaterial adverse effects on our operating results, particularly in the fiscal quarters immediately following the acquisition as the acquired restaurants are integrated into our operations;\n\u2022\nRisks associated with entering into markets or conducting operations where we have no or limited prior experience;\n\u2022\nProblems maintaining key personnel;\n\u2022\nPotential impairment of tangible and intangible assets and goodwill acquired in the acquisition;\n\u2022\nPotential unknown liabilities;\n\u2022\nDifficulties of integration; and\n\u2022\nDisruption of our ongoing business, including diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns.\nFuture acquisitions of existing restaurants from our franchisees or other acquisitions, which may be accomplished through a cash purchase transaction, the issuance of our equity securities or a combination of both, could result in potentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets, any of which could harm our business and financial condition.\nThere is volatility in our stock price.\nThe market for our stock has, from time to time, experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. Factors such as announcements of variations in our quarterly financial results and fluctuations in same-store sales could cause the market price of our stock to fluctuate significantly. In addition, the stock market in general, and the market prices for restaurant companies in particular, have experienced volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our stock, regardless of our operating performance. Additionally, volatility or a lack of positive performance in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees, many of whom have been granted equity compensation.\nThe market price of our stock can be influenced by stockholders' expectations about the ability of our business to grow and to achieve certain profitability targets. If our financial performance in a particular quarter does not meet the expectations of our stockholders, it may adversely affect their views concerning our growth potential and future financial performance. In addition, if the securities analysts who regularly follow our stock lower their ratings of our stock, the market price of our stock is likely to drop significantly.\nWe may be subject to increased labor and insurance costs.\nOur restaurant operations are subject to federal and state laws governing such matters as minimum wages, working conditions, overtime, and tip credits. As federal and state minimum wage rates increase, we may need to increase not only the wages of our minimum wage employees, but also the wages paid to employees at wage rates that are above minimum wage. Labor shortages, increased employee turnover, and health care mandates could also increase our labor costs. This, in turn, could lead us to increase prices which could impact our sales. Conversely, if competitive pressures or other factors prevent us from offsetting increased labor costs by increases in prices, our profitability may decline. In addition, the current premiums that we pay for our insurance (including workers' compensation, general liability, property, health, and directors' and officers' liability)\nmay increase at any time, thereby further increasing our costs. The dollar amount of claims that we actually experience under our workers' compensation and general liability insurance, for which we carry high per-claim deductibles, may also increase at any time, thereby further increasing our costs. Also, the decreased availability of property and liability insurance has the potential to negatively impact the cost of premiums and the magnitude of uninsured losses.\nOur current insurance may not provide adequate levels of coverage against claims.\nWe currently maintain insurance customary for businesses of our size and type. However, there are types of losses we may incur that cannot be insured against or that we believe are not economically reasonable to insure, such as losses due to natural disasters. Such damages could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on information technology and any material failure of that technology could impair our ability to efficiently operate our business.\nWe rely on information systems across our operations, including, for example, point-of-sale processing in our restaurants, management of our supply chain, collection of cash and credit and debit card payments, payment of obligations, and various other processes and procedures. Our ability to efficiently manage our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with maintenance, upgrading or transitioning to replacement systems, or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in customer service, reduce efficiency in our operations, require significant investment to remediate the issue, or cause negative publicity that could damage our brand. Significant capital investments might be required to remediate any problems.\nIf we are unable to maintain our rights to use key technologies of third parties, our business may be harmed.\nWe rely on certain technology licensed from third parties, and may be required to license additional technology in the future for use in managing our Internet sites and providing related services to users and customers. These third-party technology licenses may not continue to be available to us on acceptable commercial terms or at all. The inability to enter into and maintain any of these technology licenses could significantly harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may not be able to protect our trademarks, service marks or trade secrets.\nWe place considerable value on our trademarks, service marks and trade secrets. We actively enforce and defend our marks and if violations are identified, take appropriate action to preserve and protect our goodwill in our marks. We attempt to protect our sauce recipes as trade secrets by, among other things, requiring confidentiality agreements with our sauce suppliers and executive officers. However, we cannot be sure that we will be able to successfully enforce our rights under our marks or prevent competitors from misappropriating our sauce recipes. We can also not be sure that: (i) our marks are valuable, (ii) using our marks does not, or will not, violate others\u2019 marks, (iii) the registrations of our marks would be upheld if challenged, or (iv) we would not be prevented from using our marks in areas of the country where others might have already established rights to them. Any of these uncertainties could have an adverse effect on us and our expansion strategy.", "PERMNO": 89904, "SIC": 5812, "TIC": "BWLD"}
