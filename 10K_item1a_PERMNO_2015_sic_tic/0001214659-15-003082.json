{"cik": "1415998", "company": "National Automation Services Inc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-04-15", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS\nThe following are certain risk factors that could affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. These risk factors should be considered along with the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because these factors could cause our actual results or financial condition to differ materially from expectations. The following discussion is not an all-inclusive listing of risks although we believe these are the more material risks that we face. If any of the following occur, our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be negatively affected.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Capital Requirements\nWe have historically incurred operating losses.\nUntil our acquisition of JD, we financed our operations exclusively through private placements of common stock and convertible debt and have historically incurred losses. Although we had net income of $312,090 in 2014 as a result of JD\u2019s operations, in 2013, we incurred a net loss of $(280,596). From our inception in October 2, 2007 through December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $15.8 million. In the future, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our inability to maintain profitability would negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nExecution of our business strategy is capital intensive, and we will require substantial additional financing to achieve our goals. A failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our expansion activities.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had cash of $72,165 and a working capital deficiency of $(7,163,050). Because the outcome of our expansion activities is highly uncertain, we cannot reasonably estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete future acquisitions. In addition, other unanticipated costs may arise. As a result of these and other factors currently unknown to us, we will need to seek additional funds, through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources, such as strategic partnerships and alliances. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. Additional funds may not be available when we need them, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available to us on a timely basis, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our expansion activities or other activities.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our assets.\nWe may seek additional capital through a combination of private and public equity offerings, debt financings, strategic partnerships and alliances. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect stockholder rights. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take certain actions, such as incurring debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through strategic partnerships and alliances with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our assets on terms that are not favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financing when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our expansion activities.\nOur indebtedness could restrict our operations and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions.\nAs a result of the JD acquisition, we now have, and will continue to have, a significant amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2014, our total indebtedness was approximately $15.1 million (excluding accounts payable and accrued expenses), including loans, capital leases and lines of credit of approximately $13.3 million, convertible debt with unrelated parties of approximately $701,000, and related party debt of approximately $1.1 million, of which $610,000 is convertible. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we made cash interest payments totaling approximately $894,000. A significant portion of this indebtedness was assumed by us when we acquired JD. In addition in the period since December 31, 2014 through April 1, 2015, we have incurred further debt including the issuance of convertible notes in the aggregate principal sum of $634,000.\nOur current and future indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u00b7\nimpair our ability to make investments and obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes;\n\u00b7\nlimit our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness;\n\u00b7\nmake us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business, our industry or the economy in general as a substantial portion of our operating cash flow will be required to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, making it more difficult to react to changes in our business and in industry and market conditions;\n\u00b7\nin the case of convertible debt that is convertible into equity, result in a reduction in the overall percentage holdings of our stockholders, put downward pressure on the market price of our common stock, result in adjustments to conversion and exercise prices of outstanding notes and warrants and obligate us to issue additional shares of common stock to certain of our stockholders;\n\u00b7\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing that may be necessary to operate or expand our business;\n\u00b7\nput us at a competitive disadvantage to competitors that have less debt; and\n\u00b7\nincrease our vulnerability to interest rate increases to the extent that we incur variable rate indebtedness.\nIf JD is unable to generate sufficient cash flow or we are otherwise unable to obtain the funds required making principal and interesting payments on our indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants in instruments governing any existing or future indebtedness, we could be in default under the terms of such instruments. In the event of a default, the holders of our indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed under those instruments to be due and payable together with accrued and unpaid interest, secured lenders could foreclose on any of our assets securing their loans and we or one or more of our subsidiaries could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If our indebtedness is accelerated, or we enter into bankruptcy, we may be unable to pay all of our indebtedness in full. Any of the foregoing consequences could restrict our ability to grow our business and cause the value of our common stock to decline.\nOur management has concluded that we have material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting and that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal controls over financial reporting and, depending on our future growth, may require our independent registered public accounting firm to annually attest to our evaluation, as well as issue their own opinion on our internal controls over financial reporting. The process of implementing and maintaining proper internal controls and complying with Section 404 is expensive and time consuming. We cannot be certain that the measures we will undertake will ensure that we will maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future. Furthermore, if we are able to rapidly grow our business, the internal controls that we will need may become more complex, and significantly more resources will be required to ensure our internal controls remain effective. Failure to implement required controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. If our auditors or we discover a material weakness in our internal controls, the disclosure of that fact, even if the weakness is quickly remedied, could diminish investors\u2019 confidence in our financial statements and harm our stock price. In addition, non-compliance with Section 404 could subject us to a variety of administrative sanctions, including the suspension of trading, ineligibility for future listing on NASDAQ or other national securities exchanges, and the inability of registered broker-dealers to make a market in our common stock, which may reduce our stock price.\nIf we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, we may not be able to manage our business as effectively as we would if an effective control environment existed, and our business and reputation with investors may be harmed. As a result, our small size and any current internal control deficiencies may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operation and access to capital. During our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, management identified material weaknesses related to a lack of segregation of duties within accounting functions. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with any policies and procedures may deteriorate.\nImpairment of our long-term assets may adversely impact our financial position and results of operations.\nWe evaluate our long-term assets including property, equipment, and identifiable intangible assets in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. We use estimated future cash flows in assessing recoverability of our long-lived assets. The cash flow projections are based on our current estimates and judgmental assessments. We perform this assessment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our net assets may not be recoverable due to various external or internal factors, termed a \u201ctriggering event.\u201d Based on our evaluation for the year ended December 31, 2014, no impairment was recorded. Nevertheless, volatility in the oil and natural gas industry, which is driven by factors over which we have no control, could affect the fair market value of our equipment fleet. Under specific circumstances, this could trigger a write-down of our assets for accounting purposes, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe may become subject to tax assessments, penalties and interest for past payroll.\nWe have accrued interest and penalties of $147,200 and $155,600 for December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively related to the taxes due to the Internal Revenue Service. This interest and penalties are in relation to payroll tax remittances that, due to cash constraints, we were unable to make prior to 2011, and past payroll tax IRS audit findings for our dormant subsidiaries. In addition, our subsidiary, JD, has a payroll tax payable for the fourth quarter of 2014. We are currently working to cure these obligations. If we become subject to additional tax assessment, penalties and interest by federal and state tax authorities in the future, our results of operations, financial performance and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to JD\u2019s Business\nJD may be unable to maintain or increase pricing on our core services.\nJD may periodically seek to increase the prices on our services to offset rising costs or to generate higher returns for our shareholders. However, JD operates in a very competitive industry and, as a result JD is not always successful in raising or maintaining our existing prices. Additionally, during periods of increased market demand, a significant amount of new service capacity may enter the market, which also puts pressure on the pricing of JD\u2019s services and limits its ability to increase prices.\nEven when JD is able to increase its prices, it may not be able to do so at a rate that is sufficient to offset such rising costs. In periods of high demand for oilfield services, a tighter labor market may result in higher labor costs. During such periods, JD\u2019s labor costs could increase at a greater rate than its ability to raise prices for its services. Also, JD may not be able to successfully increase prices without adversely affecting its activity levels. The inability to maintain or increase JD\u2019s pricing as costs increase could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and results of operations.\nJD\u2019s customer base is concentrated within the oil and natural gas production industry and loss of a significant customer could cause its revenue to decline substantially.\nJD served in excess of 35 and 25 customers for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. For those same time periods, its largest customer comprised approximately 14% and 23%, respectively, of its consolidated revenues, its five largest customers comprised approximately 51% and 50%, respectively, of its consolidated revenues, and its top ten customers comprised approximately 66% and 70%, respectively, of its consolidated revenues. The loss of JD\u2019s top customer or of several of its top customers would adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. JD may be able to replace customers lost with other customers, but there can be no assurance that lost revenues could be replaced in a timely manner, with the same margins or at all.\nJD extends credit to its customers which present a risk of non-payment.\nA substantial portion of JD\u2019s accounts receivable are with customers involved in the oil and gas industry, whose revenues may be affected by fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices. Collection of these receivables could be influenced by economic factors affecting this industry.\nOur operations are inherently risky, and insurance may not always be available in amounts sufficient to fully protect us.\nJD has an insurance and risk management program in place to protect its assets, operations, and employees. It also has programs in place to address compliance with current safety and regulatory standards. However, JD\u2019s operations are subject to risks inherent in the oil and gas services industry, such as equipment defects, malfunctions, failures, accidents, and natural disasters. In addition, hazards such as unusual or unexpected geological formations, pressures, blow-outs, fires, or other conditions may be encountered in drilling and servicing wells, as well as the transportation of fluids and company assets between locations. These risks and hazards could expose JD to substantial liability for personal injury, loss of life, business interruption, property damage or destruction, pollution, and other environmental damages.\nAlthough JD has obtained insurance against certain of these risks, such insurance is subject to coverage limits and exclusions and may not be available for the risks and hazards to which it is exposed. In addition, no assurance can be given that such insurance will be adequate to cover our liabilities or will be generally available in the future or, if available, that premiums will be commercially justifiable. If JD were to incur substantial liability and such damages were not covered by insurance or were in excess of policy limits, or if JD were to incur such liability at a time when it is not able to obtain liability insurance, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nJD\u2019s assets may require significant amounts of capital for maintenance, upgrades and refurbishment.\nJD\u2019s water hauling and hydraulic fracturing servicing fleets may require significant capital investment in maintenance, upgrades and refurbishment to maintain the competitiveness of our assets. JD\u2019s rigs and fleets typically do not generate revenue while they are undergoing maintenance, refurbishment or upgrades. Any maintenance, upgrade or refurbishment project for JD\u2019s assets could increase its indebtedness or reduce cash available for other opportunities. Further, such projects may require proportionally greater capital investments as a percentage of total asset value, which may make such projects difficult to finance on acceptable terms. To the extent JD is unable to fund such projects, it may have fewer rigs and fleets available for service or our rigs and fleets may not be attractive to potential or current customers. Such demands on JD\u2019s capital or reductions in demand for our rigs and fleets could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nJD is subject to the risk of technological obsolescence.\nJD anticipates that its ability to maintain its current business and win new business will depend upon continuous improvements in operating equipment, among other things. There can be no assurance that JD will be successful in its efforts in this regard or that JD will have the resources available to continue to support this need to have its equipment remain technologically up to date and competitive. JD\u2019s failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on it. No assurances can be given that competitors will not achieve technological advantages over JD.\nOilfield anti-indemnity provisions enacted by many states may restrict or prohibit a party's indemnification of us.\nJD typically enters into agreements with its customers governing the provision of JD\u2019s services, which usually include certain indemnification provisions for losses resulting from operations. Such agreements may require each party to indemnify the other against certain claims regardless of the negligence or other fault of the indemnified party; however, many states place limitations on contractual indemnity agreements, particularly agreements that indemnify a party against the consequences of its own negligence. Furthermore, certain states, including Louisiana, New Mexico, Texas and Wyoming, have enacted statutes generally referred to as \"oilfield anti-indemnity acts\" expressly prohibiting certain indemnity agreements contained in or related to oilfield services agreements. Such oilfield anti-indemnity acts may restrict or void a party's indemnification of JD, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSevere weather could have a material adverse effect on JD\u2019s business.\nAdverse weather can directly impede JD\u2019s operations. Repercussions of severe weather conditions may include:\n\u00b7\ncurtailment of services;\n\u00b7\nweather-related damage to facilities and equipment, resulting in suspension of operations;\n\u00b7\ninability to deliver equipment and personnel to job sites in accordance with contract schedules; and\n\u00b7\nloss of productivity.\nThese constraints could delay JD\u2019s operations and materially increase its operating and capital costs. Unusually warm winters or cool summers may also adversely affect the demand for JD\u2019s services by decreasing the demand for natural gas. JD\u2019s operations in semi-arid regions can be affected by droughts and other lack of access to water used in its operations, especially with respect to our hydraulic fracturing operations.\nJD is highly dependent on its founders and key employees.\nJD\u2019s success is dependent upon its key management, technical and field personnel, especially Jason Jensen and David Gurr, JD\u2019s founders. Any loss of the services of either one of these officers, or managers with strong relationships with customers or suppliers, or a sufficient number of other employees could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. JD\u2019s ability to expand its services is dependent upon our ability to attract and retain additional qualified employees. The ability to secure the services of additional personnel may be constrained in times of strong industry activity.\nIncreased labor costs or the unavailability of skilled workers could hurt JD\u2019s operations.\nJD is dependent upon an available pool of skilled employees to maintain its business. JD competes with other oilfield services businesses and other employers to attract and retain qualified personnel with the technical skills and experience required, providing the highest quality service. The demand for skilled workers is high and the supply is limited during periods of high drilling and completions activity levels, and a shortage in the labor pool of skilled workers or other general inflationary pressures or changes in applicable laws and regulations could make it more difficult for JD to attract and retain personnel and could require it to enhance its wage and benefits packages thereby increasing our operating costs.\nAlthough JD employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement, union organizational efforts could occur and, if successful, could increase labor costs. A significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers or the unionization of groups of our employees could result in increases in the wage rates that we must pay. Likewise, laws and regulations to which JD is subject, such as the Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum wage, overtime and other working conditions, can increase labor costs or subject JD to liabilities. We cannot assure you that labor costs will not increase. Increases in our labor costs or unavailability of skilled workers could impair our capacity and diminish our profitability, having a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nHistorically, the oil and gas services industry has experienced a high annual employee turnover rate. We believe that the high turnover rate is attributable to the nature of the work, which is physically demanding and performed outdoors, and to the volatility and cyclical nature of the oilfield services industry. As a result, workers may choose to pursue employment in fields that offer a more desirable work environment at wage rates that are competitive with that of JD. We cannot assure you that JD will be able to recruit, train and retain an adequate number of workers to replace departing workers. The inability to maintain an adequate workforce could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to the Oil & Gas Services Industry\nJD\u2019s business depends on domestic spending by the oil and gas industry, and this spending and JD\u2019s business has been in the past, and may in the future be, adversely affected by industry and financial market conditions that are beyond our control.\nJD depends on its customers\u2019 willingness to make operating and capital expenditures to explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas in the United States. Customers\u2019 expectations for lower market prices for oil and natural gas, as well as the availability of capital for operating and capital expenditures, may cause them to curtail spending, thereby reducing demand for our services and equipment.\nIndustry conditions are influenced by numerous factors over which JD has no control, such as the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, domestic and worldwide economic conditions, political instability in oil and natural gas producing countries and merger and divestiture activity among oil and gas producers. The volatility of the oil and natural gas industry and the consequent impact on exploration and production activity could adversely impact the level of drilling and work-over activity by some of JD\u2019s customers. This reduction may cause a decline in the demand for our services or adversely affect the price of JD\u2019s services. In addition, reduced discovery rates of new oil and natural gas reserves in JD\u2019s market areas also may have a negative long-term impact on JD\u2019s business, even in an environment of stronger oil and natural gas prices, to the extent existing production is not replaced.\nDeterioration in the global economic environment commencing in the latter part of 2008 and continuing throughout 2009 caused the oilfield services industry to cycle into a downturn due to weakened demand. The industry returned to higher activity levels in 2011 and remained higher during the first half of 2012, before another downturn in the second half of 2012, affecting natural gas prices in particular. The industry pricing remained relatively stable through the middle of 2014. However, beginning in the second half of 2014, oil prices declined substantially from historical highs and may remain depressed for the foreseeable future. Adverse changes in capital markets and declines in prices for oil and natural gas may cause oil and natural gas producers to announce reductions in capital budgets for future periods. In light of the recent depressed oil prices, many oil producers, including many of JD\u2019s customers, have announced reductions in capital budgets for 2015.\nLimitations on the availability of capital, or higher costs of capital, for financing expenditures may cause oil and natural gas producers to make further reductions to capital budgets in the future even if oil or natural gas prices increase from current levels. Any such cuts in spending will curtail drilling programs as well as discretionary spending on well services, which may result in a reduction in the demand for JD\u2019s services, the rates we can charge and our utilization. In addition, certain of our customers could become unable to pay their suppliers, including us. Any of these conditions or events could adversely affect our operating results.\nJD may be adversely affected by uncertainty in the global financial markets and the continuing worldwide economic slowdown.\nDespite recent modest improvements, JD\u2019s future results may be impacted by the continuing worldwide economic slowdown, inflation, deflation, or other adverse economic conditions. These conditions may negatively affect JD or parties with whom we do business. The impact on such third parties could result in their non-payment or inability to perform obligations owed to JD such as the failure of customers to honor their commitments or the failure of major suppliers to complete orders. Additionally, credit market conditions may change slowing JD\u2019s collection efforts as customers may experience increased difficulty in obtaining requisite financing, potentially leading to lost revenue and higher than normal accounts receivable. This could result in greater expense associated with collection efforts and increased bad debt expense.\nA continuation or deterioration of the economic uncertainty may cause institutional investors to respond to their customers by increasing interest rates, enacting tighter lending standards, or refusing to refinance existing debt upon its maturity or on terms similar to the expiring debt. JD may require additional capital in the future. However, due to the above listed factors, JD cannot be certain that additional funding will be available if needed and, to the extent required, on acceptable terms.\nConservation measures and technological advances could reduce demand for oil and natural gas.\nFuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas, technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices could reduce demand for oil and natural gas. Management cannot predict the impact of the changing demand for oil and natural gas services, and any major changes may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCompetition within the oil and gas services industry may adversely affect our ability to market our services.\nJD\u2019s largest competitors performing both well servicing and fluid logistics are RW Jones Trucking, WestRoc, and Howcroft, Inc. JD\u2019s ability to generate revenues and earnings depends primarily upon our ability to win bids in competitive bidding processes and to perform awarded projects within estimated times and costs. There can be no assurance that competitors will not substantially increase the resources devoted to the development and marketing of products and services that compete with JD\u2019s or that new or existing competitors will not enter the various markets in which JD is active. In certain aspects of JD\u2019s business, it also competes with a number of small and medium-sized companies that, like JD, have certain competitive advantages such as lower overhead costs and specialized regional strengths. In addition, reduced levels of activity in the oil and natural gas industry could intensify competition and the pressure on competitive pricing and may result in lower revenues or margins to JD.\nDue to the nature of JD\u2019s business, it may be subject to environmental liability.\nJD\u2019s business operations are subject to numerous United States federal, state and local environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, including those relating to hauling of soil and groundwater contamination. The nature of its business exposes JD to risks of liability under these laws and regulations due to the production, generation, storage, use, transportation, and disposal of materials that can cause contamination or personal injury if released into the environment. Environmental laws and regulations may have a significant effect on the costs of transportation and storage of raw materials as well as the costs of the transportation, treatment, storage, and disposal of wastes. JD believes it is in material compliance with applicable environmental and worker health and safety requirements. However, it may incur substantial costs, including fines, damages, criminal or civil sanctions, remediation costs, or experience interruptions in our operations for violations or liabilities arising under these laws and regulations. Although JD may have the benefit of insurance maintained by our customers or by other third parties or by us such insurances may not cover every expense. Further, JD may become liable for damages against which it cannot adequately insure or against which it may elect not to insure because of high costs or other reasons.\nJD\u2019s customers are subject to similar environmental laws and regulations, as well as limits on emissions to the air and discharges into surface and sub-surface waters. Although regulatory developments that may occur in subsequent years could have the effect of reducing industry activity, JD cannot predict the nature of any new restrictions or regulations that may be imposed. JD may be required to increase operating expenses or capital expenditures in order to comply with any new restrictions or regulations.\nChanges in trucking regulations may increase our costs and negatively impact our results of operations.\nFor the transportation and relocation of oilfield services equipment and our fluid handling operations, JD operates trucks and other heavy equipment. Therefore, JD is subject to regulation as a motor carrier by the U.S. Department of Transportation and by various state agencies, whose regulations include certain permit requirements of highway and safety authorities. These regulatory authorities exercise broad powers over JD\u2019s trucking operations, generally governing such matters as the authorization to engage in motor carrier operations, safety, equipment testing and specifications and insurance requirements. The trucking industry is subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may impact JD\u2019s operations, such as changes in fuel emissions limits, the hours of service regulations that govern the amount of time a driver may drive or work in any specific period, limits on vehicle weight and size and other matters. On May 21, 2010, President Obama signed an executive memorandum directing the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (\"NHTSA\") and the EPA to develop new, stricter fuel efficiency standards for medium- and heavy-duty trucks. On September 15, 2011, the NHTSA and the EPA published regulations that regulate fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions from medium- and heavy-duty trucks, beginning with vehicles built for model year 2014. As a result of these regulations, JD may experience an increase in costs related to truck purchases and maintenance, an impairment of equipment productivity, a decrease in the residual value of these vehicles and an increase in operating expenses. Proposals to increase federal, state or local taxes, including taxes on motor fuels, are also made from time to time, and any such increase would increase our operating costs. We cannot predict whether, or in what form, any legislative or regulatory changes applicable to JD\u2019s trucking operations will be enacted and to what extent any such legislation or regulations could increase JD\u2019s costs or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nJD is subject to extensive additional governmental regulation.\nIn addition to environmental and trucking regulations, JD\u2019s operations are subject to a variety of other United States federal, state, and local laws, regulations and guidelines, including laws and regulations relating to health and safety, the conduct of operations, and the manufacture, management, transportation, storage and disposal of certain materials used in its operations. Also, JD may become subject to such regulation in any new jurisdiction in which it may operate.\nAlthough JD continues to enhance its infrastructure, it has invested financial and managerial resources to comply with applicable laws, regulations and guidelines and expects to continue to do so in the future. Although regulatory expenditures have not, historically, been material to JD, such laws, regulations and guidelines are subject to change. Accordingly, it is impossible for JD to predict the cost or effect of such laws, regulations, or guidelines on its future operations.\nRisks of Expansion by Acquisition\nWe may not be successful in identifying and making acquisitions.\nOur business strategy depends in large part on our ability to identify and acquire suitable companies, to expand our current expertise into the markets of our acquired companies, and to capitalize on the expertise of these companies to obtain new business in our current markets. We may be unable to make accretive acquisitions or realize expected benefits of any acquisitions for any of the following reasons:\n\u00b7\nfailure to identify attractive targets in the marketplace;\n\u00b7\nincorrect assumptions regarding the future results of acquired operations or assets or expected cost reductions or other synergies expected to be realized as a result of acquiring operations or assets;\n\u00b7\nfailure to obtain acceptable financing;\n\u00b7\nrestrictions in our debt agreements;\n\u00b7\nfailure to integrate successfully the operations or management of any acquired operations or assets in a timely manner;\n\u00b7\nfailure to retain or attract key employees;\n\u00b7\nand diversion of management's attention from existing operations or other priorities.\nThe acquisition transactions may also result in the following:\n\u00b7\nissuance of additional stock that would further dilute our current stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership;\n\u00b7\nincurring debt;\n\u00b7\nassumption of unknown or contingent liabilities;\n\u00b7\nnegative effects on reported operating results from acquisition-related charges and\n\u00b7\namortization of acquired technology, goodwill and other intangibles.\nIf we are unable to identify, complete and integrate acquisitions, it could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to fully integrate future acquisitions.\nAchieving the benefits of acquisitions depends in part on having the acquired assets perform as expected, successfully consolidating functions, retaining key employees and customer relationships, and integrating operations and procedures in a timely and efficient manner. Such integration may require substantial management effort, time, and resources and may divert management\u2019s focus from other strategic opportunities and operational matters, and ultimately we may fail to realize anticipated benefits of acquisitions.\nWe may seek an acquisition with a financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established record of revenue or earnings.\nTo the extent we complete an acquisition with a financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established record of sales or earnings, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the operations of the business with which we acquire. These risks include volatile revenues or earnings and difficulties in obtaining and retaining key personnel. Although our officers and directors will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we may not be able to properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors and we may not have adequate time to complete due diligence. Furthermore, some of these risks may be outside of our control and leave us with no ability to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business.\nResources could be wasted in researching acquisitions that are not completed, which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business.\nThe investigation of each specific target business and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial costs for accountants, attorneys and others. If we are unable to complete a specific acquisition, the costs incurred up to that point for the proposed transaction likely would not be recoverable. Furthermore, if we reach an agreement relating to a specific target business, we may fail to complete our acquisition for any number of reasons including those beyond our control. Any such event will result in a loss to us of the related costs incurred which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire another business.\nBusiness growth could outpace the capabilities of our infrastructure and workforce.\nWe cannot be certain that our infrastructure and workforce will be adequate to support our operations as we expand. Future growth also could impose significant additional demands on our resources, resulting in additional responsibilities of our senior management, including the need to recruit and integrate new senior level managers, executives and operating personnel. We cannot be certain that we will be able to recruit and retain such additional personnel. Moreover, we may need to expend significant time and money in the future to integrate and unify our systems and infrastructure. To the extent that we are unable to manage our growth effectively, or are unable to attract and retain additional qualified personnel, we may not be able to expand our operations or execute our business plan.\nRisks Related to the Reverse Split\nOn December 11, 2014, we effected a 1-for-200 reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock. If the market price of our common stock declines following the reverse stock split, the percentage decline may be greater than would occur in the absence of a reverse stock split.\nThe reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock is intended to increase the market price of our common stock. However, the effect of a reverse stock split upon the market price of our common stock cannot be predicted with certainty, and the results of reverse stock splits by companies in similar circumstances have been varied. It is not uncommon for the market price of a company's common stock to decline in the period following a reverse stock split. If the market price of our common stock declines following the reverse stock split, the percentage decline may be greater than would occur in the absence of a reverse stock split. In any event, other factors unrelated to the number of shares of our common stock outstanding, such as negative financial or operational results, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe reverse stock split may decrease the liquidity of the shares of our common stock.\nThe liquidity of the shares of our common stock may be affected adversely by the reverse stock split given the reduced number of shares that are outstanding following the reverse stock split, especially if the market price of our common stock does not increase as a result of the reverse stock split. In addition, the reverse stock split increased the number of stockholders who own odd lots (less than 100 shares) of our common stock, creating the potential for such stockholders to experience an increase in the cost of selling their shares and greater difficulty effecting such sales.\nFollowing the reverse stock split, the resulting market price of our common stock may not attract new investors, including institutional investors, and may not satisfy the investing requirements of those investors. Consequently, the trading liquidity of our common stock may not improve.\nAlthough we believe that a higher market price of our common stock may help generate greater or broader investor interest, there can be no assurance that the reverse stock split will result in a share price that will attract new investors, including institutional investors. In addition, there can be no assurance that the market price of our common stock will satisfy the investing requirements of those investors. As a result, the trading liquidity of our common stock may not necessarily improve.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nOur common stock could be further diluted as the result of the issuance of additional shares of common stock, convertible securities, warrants or options.\nIn the past, we have issued common stock, convertible securities (such as convertible debentures and notes) and warrants in order to raise money, some of which have anti-dilution and other similar protections. We have also issued options and warrants as compensation for services and incentive compensation for our employees and directors. We have shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon the exercise of certain of these securities and may increase the shares reserved for these purposes in the future. Our issuance of additional common stock, convertible securities, options and warrants could affect the rights of our stockholders, result in a reduction in the overall percentage holdings of our stockholders, could put downward pressure on the market price of our common stock, could result in adjustments to conversion and exercise prices of outstanding notes and warrants, and could obligate us to issue additional shares of common stock to certain of our stockholders.\nOur shares of common stock are very thinly traded, and the price may not reflect our value and there can be no assurance that there will be an active market for our shares of common stock either now or in the future.\nOur shares of common stock are thinly traded, a small percentage of our common stock is available to be traded and is held by a small number of holders and the price, if traded, may not reflect our actual or perceived value. There can be no assurance that there will be an active market for our shares of common stock either now or in the future. The market liquidity will be dependent on the perception of our operating business, among other things. We may take certain steps including utilizing investor awareness campaigns, press releases, road shows and conferences to increase awareness of our business and any steps that we might take to bring us to the awareness of investors may require we compensate consultants with cash and/or stock. There can be no assurance that there will be any awareness generated or the results of any efforts will result in any impact on our trading volume. Consequently, investors may not be able to liquidate their investment or liquidate it at a price that reflects the value of the business and trading may be at an inflated price relative to the performance of our company due to, among other things, availability of sellers of our shares. If a market should develop, the price may be highly volatile. Because there may be a low price for our shares of common stock, many brokerage firms or clearing firms may not be willing to effect transactions in the securities or accept our shares for deposit in an account. Even if an investor finds a broker willing to effect a transaction in the shares of our common stock, the combination of brokerage commissions, transfer fees, taxes, if any, and any other selling costs may exceed the selling price. Further, many lending institutions will not permit the use of low priced shares of common stock as collateral for any loans.\nWe may be unable to list our common stock on NASDAQ, NYSE MKT or on any securities exchange.\nOur common stock currently does not meet all of the requirements for initial listing on a registered stock exchange. Although we may apply to list our common stock on NASDAQ or the NYSE MKT in the future, we cannot assure you that we will be able to meet the initial listing standards, including the minimum bid price per share and minimum capitalization requirements, or that we will be able to maintain a listing of our common stock on either of those or any other trading venue. Until such time as we qualify for listing on NASDAQ, the NYSE MKT or another trading venue, we expect our common stock will continue to trade on the over-the-counter market.\nThe price of our common stock is volatile, which may cause investment losses for our stockholders.\nThe market for our common stock is highly volatile, having ranged in the last twelve months from a low of $0.40 to a high of $11.20 on the OTCQB. The trading price of our common stock on the OTCQB is subject to wide fluctuations in response to, among other things, quarterly variations in operating and financial results, and general economic and market conditions. In addition, statements or changes in opinions, ratings, or earnings estimates made by brokerage firms or industry analysts relating to our market or relating to us could result in an immediate and adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. The highly volatile nature of our stock price may cause investment losses for our shareholders. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. If securities class action litigation is brought against us, such litigation could result in substantial costs while diverting management\u2019s attention and resources.\nOur revenue and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter, and fluctuations in operating results could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur revenue and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors. In future quarters, operating results may be below the expectations of investors, and the price of our common stock may decline. Factors that could cause quarterly fluctuations include:\n\u00b7\nthe ability to raise the necessary capital to implement our strategic plan;\n\u00b7\nthe ability of JD to keep current customers and secure new customers; and\n\u00b7\nthe ability to complete new acquisitions\nAccordingly, the failure to obtain significant future revenue, lower than expected revenue in the future, and decreased working capital could adversely affect our stock price and liquidity.\nShares eligible for future sale may adversely affect the market.\nFrom time to time, certain of our stockholders may be eligible to sell all or some of their shares of common stock by means of ordinary brokerage transactions in the open market pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act, subject to certain limitations. In general, pursuant to Rule 144, non-affiliate stockholders may sell freely after six months subject only to the current public information requirement. Affiliates may sell after six months subject to the Rule 144 volume, manner of sale (for equity securities), and current public information and notice requirements. Any substantial sales of our common stock pursuant to Rule 144 may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nOur stock is subject to the penny stock rules, which impose significant restrictions on broker-dealers and may affect the resale of our stock.\nOur common stock has been subject to the provisions of Section 15(g) and Rule 15g-9 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), commonly referred to as the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rule. Section 15(g) sets forth certain requirements for transactions in penny stocks and Rule 15g-9(d)(1) incorporates the definition of penny stock as that used in Rule 3a51-1 of the Exchange Act. The SEC generally defines penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price less than US$5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Rule 3a51-1 provides that any equity security is considered to be penny stock unless that security is: registered and traded on a national securities exchange meeting specified criteria set by the SEC; issued by a registered investment company; excluded from the definition on the basis of price (at least US$5.00 per share) or the registrant\u2019s net tangible assets; or exempted from the definition by the Commission. Our common stock is considered to be a \u201cpenny stock.\u201d The SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in \u201cpenny stocks.\u201d As our common stock is considered to be \u201cpenny stock,\u201d trading in our common stock will be subject to additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell penny stock to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. This may reduce the liquidity and trading volume of our shares.\nWe and our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are parties to a consent agreement and order with the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities.\nOn November 19, 2014, we, together with Robert Chance and Jeremy Briggs (collectively, the \u201cRespondents\u201d) entered into a consent agreement and order with the Department of Banking and Securities of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (the \u201cDepartment) pursuant to which the Department found, based on certain allegations, that the Respondents offered for sale unregistered stock in violation of Pennsylvania state securities laws. The Respondents neither admitted nor denied the allegations made by the Department and vigorously dispute any wrongdoing. As part of the consent order, a prior cease and desist order issued in 2009 against the Respondents was prospectively rescinded, the Respondents were ordered to pay investigative and legal costs of $500 and the Respondents were ordered to comply with the Pennsylvania securities laws. Any additional regulatory action, litigation, or governmental proceedings could adversely affect us by, among other things, distracting management from its duties to us and resulting in monetary damages and other penalties.\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (\u201cFINRA\u201d) sales practice requirements may limit a shareholder\u2019s ability to buy and sell our common shares.\nIn addition to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules described above, FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer\u2019s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market for our shares.\nBecause our directors and executive officers are among our largest stockholders, they can exert significant control over our business and affairs and have actual or potential interests that may depart from those of our other stockholders.\nOur directors and executive officers own or control a significant percentage of our common stock. Additionally, the holdings of our directors and executive officers may increase in the future upon vesting or other maturation of exercise rights under any of the options or warrants they may hold or in the future be granted or if they otherwise acquire additional shares of our common stock. Our current officers and directors beneficially own an aggregate of 1,133,907 shares of our common stock or a total of approximately 25.3% of the voting power of all our outstanding shares of stock. In addition, one of our directors has the power to vote approximately 1,350,000 additional shares of our common stock which are held in reserve but have not been issued pursuant to a limited power of attorney. The interests of such persons may differ from the interests of our other stockholders. As a result, in addition to their board seats and offices, such persons will have significant influence over and control all corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, irrespective of how our other stockholders may vote, including the following actions:\n\u00b7\nto elect or defeat the election of our directors;\n\u00b7\nto amend or prevent amendment of our Articles of Incorporation or By-laws;\n\u00b7\nto effect or prevent a merger, sale of assets or other corporate transaction; and\n\u00b7\nto control the outcome of any other matter submitted to our stockholders for vote.\nIn addition, such persons\u2019 stock ownership may discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us, which in turn could reduce our stock price or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over our stock price.\nWe engage in transactions with related parties and such transactions present possible conflicts of interest that could have an adverse effect on us.\nWe have entered into a number of transactions with related parties. The details of certain of these transactions are set forth in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Related party transactions create the possibility of conflicts of interest with regard to our management. Such a conflict could cause an individual in our management to seek to advance his or her economic interests above those of us. Further, the appearance of conflicts of interest created by related party transactions could impair the confidence of our investors. It is possible that a conflict of interest could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIf we lose key employees and consultants or are unable to attract or retain qualified personnel, our business could suffer.\nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified management personnel. We are highly dependent on our management, including Robert Chance, our CEO, and Jeremy Briggs, our CFO. The loss of the services of their services would have a material adverse effect on our operations and we do not maintain any \"key man\" insurance on them. If we were to lose Mr. Chance or Mr. Briggs, or any other key employees or consultants, we may experience difficulties in competing effectively and executing on our business strategy.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We may not have sufficient funds to legally pay dividends. Even if funds are legally available to pay dividends, we may nevertheless decide in our sole discretion not to pay dividends. The declaration, payment and amount of any future dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors, and will depend upon, among other things, the results of our operations, cash flows and financial condition, operating and capital requirements, and other factors our board of directors may consider relevant. There is no assurance that we will pay any dividends in the future, and, if dividends are paid, there is no assurance with respect to the amount of any such dividend.", "PERMNO": 88171, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "NASV"}
