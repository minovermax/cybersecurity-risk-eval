{"cik": "1604643", "company": "Evoqua Water Technologies Corp.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-11-17", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. Although the risks are organized by headings and each risk is described separately, many of the risks are interrelated. While we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects in the future. Any one or more of such factors could directly or indirectly cause our actual results of operations and financial condition to vary materially from past or anticipated future results of operations and financial condition.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, the resulting global economic slowdown, and the reopening of global economies that has followed have created a number of macroeconomic challenges that have impacted our business, including volatility and uncertainty in business planning, disruptions in global supply chains, material, freight and labor inflation, shortages of and delays in obtaining certain materials and component parts, and labor shortages. To date, the pandemic has negatively impacted sales volume across our business, due primarily to customer site access restrictions, temporary customer site closures, and temporary delays in annual maintenance activities by customers in certain end markets. Further, certain of our customers have restricted access to their sites such that only our vaccinated employees may enter such sites, which may delay our timely provision of services to them.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also heightened risks associated with our operations. Our service technicians enter high-risk areas such as hospitals and testing laboratories, putting them at greater risk of exposure to the virus. An outbreak among our service technician population or an outbreak among employees at any of our manufacturing facilities, which may require us to suspend or reduce operations at that facility, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Additionally, a large number of our employees continue to work remotely, resulting in increased cyber-security risk.\nFurther, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, acting at the direction of the President of the United States, published a Temporary Emergency Standard requiring certain companies to vaccinate their employees or test those who are not vaccinated at least once per week. This could impact employee retention or increase our costs of operation. If we\nare unable to respond to and manage the impact of these events, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. Additionally, if we are unable to comply with these requirements, we could face enforcement actions or financial penalties.\nThe duration and severity of the pandemic remain uncertain and cannot be predicted. If COVID-19 and its variants continue to spread, or if the duration of the disruptions caused by the pandemic is further prolonged, our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected. Even after the COVID-19 outbreak has subsided, we may continue to experience impacts to our business and our financial results in subsequent periods due to the pandemic\u2019s impact on the global economy and on certain markets that we serve. COVID-19 and future public health crises and pandemics may also affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us or not presently considered to be a significant risk to our operations. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks and uncertainties described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nOur financial results depend on successful project execution and may be adversely affected by cost overruns, failure to meet customer schedules or other execution issues.\nA significant portion of our revenue is derived from large projects that are technically complex and may occur over multiple years. These projects are subject to a number of significant risks, including project delays, cost overruns, changes in scope, unanticipated site conditions, design and engineering issues, incorrect cost assumptions, increases in the cost of materials and labor, health and safety hazards, third party performance issues, weather issues and changes in laws or permitting requirements. If we are unable to manage these risks, we may incur higher costs, liquidated damages, and other liabilities to our customers, which may decrease our profitability and harm our reputation. Many of these projects require us to contract with engineering, procurement, and construction firms (\u201cEPCs\u201d). If an EPC that we have commissioned to build a new project defaults or fails to fulfill its contractual obligations, we could face significant delays, cost overruns and liabilities. Our continued growth will depend in part on executing a higher volume of large projects, which will require us to expand and retain our project management and execution personnel and resources.\nOur business could be adversely affected by material, freight, and labor inflation and other manufacturing and operating cost increases and commodity availability constraints.\nCertain commodities and materials used in our operations, including, but not limited to, steel, caustic, carbon, calcium nitrate, and iridium, are subject to significant price fluctuations. Volatility in the market price and availability of these materials has a direct impact on the cost of operating our business. Our operating costs are also impacted by fluctuations in the cost of energy and related utilities, freight, and labor. We have experienced material, freight, and labor cost increases, and we have taken actions to mitigate the impact of these cost increases through price increases, cost savings projects, and sourcing decisions, as well as through strategic productivity improvements. If we are unable to offset these cost increases, it will adversely impact our gross profit, gross margin and operating profit. In addition, many of our contracts are long-term in nature, and our failure to accurately project operating costs or negotiate or enforce price escalation provisions in our long-term contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nReliance on third party shipping companies may impact our ability to execute projects on time and within budget.\nWe rely upon various means of transportation through third parties, including shipments by air, sea, rail, and truck, to deliver products to our facilities from vendors and from our facilities to our customers, as well as for direct shipments from vendors to customers. Factors beyond our control, many of which have been caused or exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, including labor shortages and capacity constraints in the transportation industry, container shortages, port congestion, disruptions to the national and international transportation infrastructure, fuel shortages, and transportation cost increases (such as increases in fuel costs or port fees), have impacted and could further impact our ability to execute projects or ship products to our customers on time and within budget, which could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Generally, we have been able to pass on the majority of shipping and related charges to our customers, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so into the future. Failure to do so may adversely impact our gross profit and gross margin.\nWe may incur liabilities to customers as a result of warranty claims or failure to meet performance guarantees, which could reduce our profitability.\nOur customers typically require product warranties as to the proper operation and conformance to specifications of the products we manufacture or install, and performance guarantees as to any effluent water produced by our equipment and services. Failure of our products to operate properly or to meet specifications of our customers or our failure to meet our performance guarantees may increase costs by requiring additional engineering resources and services, replacement of parts and equipment and frequent replacement of consumables or monetary reimbursement to a customer or could otherwise result in liability to our customers. We have in the past received warranty claims, and we expect to continue to receive them in the future. There are significant uncertainties and judgments involved in estimating warranty and performance guarantee obligations, including changing product designs, differences in customer installation processes and failure to identify or disclaim certain variables in a customer\u2019s influent. To the extent that we incur substantial warranty or performance guarantee claims in any period, our reputation, earnings, and ability to obtain future business could be materially adversely affected.\nOur inability to meet our own and our customers\u2019 safety standards could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability.\nMaintaining a strong and reliable reputation for safety is critical to our business. Many of our customers actively monitor and review our company-wide safety record. Risks arising from unsafe products or unsafe performance by our employees include, among other things, personal injury or death caused by our products or occurring in our facilities, the destruction of customer or third-party property during the execution of a service arrangement or due to the malfunction of our products, delays in or suspension of service or the failure to timely deliver our products. Workplace accidents or near-accidents, product-related accidents, or the failure to follow our own or our customers\u2019 safety policies could damage our reputation or our customers\u2019 perception of our safety record, which could have a material adverse impact on demand for our products and services, result in additional costs to our business or the loss of customers, result in litigation against us or increase government or regulatory oversight over us.\nFailure to effectively treat emerging contaminants could result in material liabilities.\nA number of emerging contaminants might be found in water that we treat, including PFAS, PFOA, selenium, micro-plastics, hazardous chemicals, or pathogens that may cause a number of illnesses, including cholera, typhoid fever, cancer, giardiasis, cryptosporidiosis, amoebiasis and free-living amoebic infections. Such contaminants or pathogens may be found in the environment, and, as a result, there is a risk that they could be present in water treated using our systems or products. In applications where treated water enters the human body, illness and death may result if contaminants or pathogens are not eliminated during the treatment process. In particular, contamination could result from failing to properly treat reusable products before they are distributed to our customers, or from actions taken by our customers or other third parties using our products, which could result in material liability. The potential impact of a contamination of water treated using our products, services or solutions is difficult to predict and could lead to an increased risk of exposure to product liability claims, increased scrutiny by federal and state regulatory agencies and negative publicity. Further, an outbreak of disease in any one of the municipal markets we serve could result in a widespread loss of customers across other such markets.\nOur future growth is dependent upon our ability to continue to develop or acquire new products, services and solutions that allow us to compete successfully in our markets.\nWe offer our products, services, and solutions in highly competitive markets. Our future growth depends upon our ability to (i) identify emerging trends in our target end markets, (ii) develop and maintain a wide range of competitive and appropriately priced products, services and solutions, (iii) enhance and differentiate our products from those of our competitors, (iv) develop and drive commercial acceptance of new products quickly and cost-effectively, (v) ensure that our products, services and solutions remain cost-competitive, even when faced with rising commodity costs, (vi) attract, develop and retain individuals with the requisite technical expertise and understanding of customers\u2019 needs to develop and sell new technologies and products, and (vii) execute projects in a cost-effective manner according to the schedules required by our customers.\nOur growth strategy includes growth through acquisitions, and we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition targets or otherwise successfully implement our growth strategy.\nAcquisitions have historically been a significant part of our growth strategy, and we expect to continue to grow through acquisitions in the future. We may not be able to identify suitable candidates, negotiate appropriate or favorable acquisition terms, obtain financing that may be needed to consummate such transactions or complete proposed acquisitions. There is significant competition for acquisition and expansion opportunities in our businesses.\nAcquisitions require significant time and attention from management and other key personnel, which may result in attention being diverted from the operation of our existing business. Other risks associated with our acquisition strategy include ineffective integration of an acquisition, as further described below, inaccurately estimating a target\u2019s financial condition or risk profile, failure to achieve planned synergies, litigation relating to an acquisition, failure to receive required regulatory approvals or such approvals being delayed or restrictively conditional, potentially insufficient internal controls over financial activities or financial reporting at an acquired entity that could impact our existing business on a combined basis, and an adverse impact on our existing business resulting from an acquired business that historically had a higher risk tolerance or whose personnel fail to comply with our existing policies.\nWe may have difficulty operating or integrating any acquired businesses, assets, or product lines profitably, or in successfully implementing our growth strategy.\nThe anticipated benefits from any potential acquisitions may not be achieved unless the operations of the acquired business assets or product lines are successfully integrated in an efficient, effective, and timely manner. The integration of our acquisitions will require substantial attention from management and operating personnel to ensure that the acquisition does not disrupt any existing operations or affect our customers\u2019 opinions and perceptions of our services, products, or customer support. Risks associated with integration of an acquisition include failure of an acquired business to perform to our expectations, our failure to integrate it appropriately and on a timely basis, our failure to realize anticipated synergies and cost savings, our failure to preserve the customer relationships and retain key employees of an acquired business and difficulties, inefficiencies or cost overruns in integrating and assimilating the organizational cultures, operations, technologies, data, services and products of the acquired business with ours.\nThe process of integrating acquired businesses, assets and product lines could cause the interruption of, or delays in, the operation of our existing business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. Acquisitions also place a burden on our information, financial and operating systems and our employees and management. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, we may spend time and resources on such acquisitions that do not ultimately increase our profitability or that cause loss of, or harm to, relationships with employees and customers.\nWe may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our restructuring actions, which may materially adversely affect us.\nWe have taken a number of restructuring actions in recent years in an effort to better serve the needs of our customers worldwide, achieve cost savings and operational efficiencies, and position ourselves for improved long-term growth and profitability. Achieving the expected cost savings and efficiencies will be subject to significant economic, competitive, and other uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control, and we may not be able to obtain the cost savings and benefits that we currently anticipate in connection with these restructuring actions. Our assumptions may not be accurate, and we may not be able to operate in accordance with our plans, which may cause us to incur additional restructuring charges. These types of initiatives could yield unintended consequences such as distraction of our management and employees, business disruption and unforeseen costs, attrition beyond any planned reduction in workforce, inability to attract or retain key personnel and reduced employee productivity, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The successful implementation and execution of our restructuring actions are critical to achieving our expected cost savings as well as effectively competing in the marketplace and positioning us for future growth. If our restructuring actions are not executed successfully, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nDelays in enactment or repeals of environmental laws and regulations may make our products, services, and solutions unnecessary or less economically beneficial to our customers, adversely affecting demand for our products, services, and solutions.\nCertain of our products, services and solutions assist various industries and municipalities in meeting stringent environmental and safety requirements enacted for the purpose of making water cleaner and safer. Our future growth is dependent in part on the impact and timing of potential new water laws and regulations, as well as potential changes to existing laws and regulations. If stricter laws or regulations are delayed or are not enacted, or repealed or amended to be less strict, or enacted with prolonged phase-in periods, or not enforced, demand for our products and services may be reduced. We are currently unable to predict whether changes to statutes and rules will affect demand for our products and services. To the extent that such changes have a negative impact on us, including as a result of related uncertainty, these changes may materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nIf we become subject to claims relating to handling, storage, release, or disposal of hazardous materials, we could incur significant costs and experience delays in our business due to our efforts to comply.\nOur business activities, including our manufacturing processes and waste recycling and treatment processes, currently involve the use, treatment, storage, transfer, handling and/or disposal of hazardous materials, chemicals, and wastes. These activities create a risk of significant environmental liabilities and reputational damage. Under applicable environmental laws and regulations, including RCRA and CERCLA, we could be strictly, jointly, and severally liable for releases of regulated substances by us at our current or former properties or the properties of others or by other businesses that previously owned or used our current or former properties. We could also be liable or incur reputational damage if we merely generate hazardous materials or wastes, or arrange for their transportation, disposal, or treatment, or we transport such materials, and they are subsequently released or cause harm. Our business activities also create a risk of contamination or injury to our employees, customers or third parties, from the use, treatment, storage, transfer, handling and/or disposal of these materials, and these activities could result in accidental contamination or injury to the general public, as end-users of our industrial and municipal customers\u2019 products and services.\nIn the event that our business activities result in environmental liabilities, such as those described above, we could incur significant costs or reputational damage in connection with the investigation and remediation of environmental contamination, and we could be liable for any resulting damages including natural resource damages. Such liabilities could exceed our available liquidity or any applicable insurance coverage we may have. Additionally, we are subject to, on an ongoing basis, federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations may become significant and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nFailure to retain our existing senior management, skilled technical, engineering, sales and other key personnel or the inability to attract and retain new qualified personnel could materially and adversely impact our ability to operate or grow our business.\nOur success depends to a significant extent on our ability to attract and retain talent, specifically in senior management and skilled technical, engineering, sales, project management and other key roles. Macroeconomic conditions, specifically labor shortages, increased competition for employees and wage inflation, could have a material impact on our ability to attract and retain talent, our turnover rate, and the cost of operating our business. If we are unable to attract and retain sufficient talent, minimize employee turnover, or manage wage inflation, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nWastewater operations may result in contamination or pose other significant risks that could cause us to incur significant costs.\nWastewater treatment involves various unique risks. If our treatment systems fail or do not operate properly, or if there is a spill, untreated or partially treated wastewater could discharge onto property or into nearby streams and rivers, causing various damages and injuries, including environmental damage. These risks are most acute during periods of substantial\nrainfall or flooding, which are the main causes of sewer overflow and system failure. Liabilities resulting from such damages and injuries could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nWeather conditions, climate change, and legislation or regulations addressing climate change may adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe physical impacts of climate change are highly uncertain and vary depending on geographical location, but could include changing temperatures, droughts, water shortages, wildfires, changes in weather and rainfall patterns, changes in sea levels, and changing storm patterns and intensities. These impacts present several potential challenges to water and wastewater service providers, such as potential degradation of water quality and changes in demand for water services, particularly during periods of increased precipitation, flooding, or water shortages. Inclement weather and extreme weather events may have varying impacts on our business. Certain events may disrupt the operations of our customers, creating customer shutdowns that prevent or defer our performance of services or sale of equipment, while other events may drive increased demand for our products and services, particularly emergency response services, which may create volatility in our financial results. Additionally, these events may disrupt our own operations and the operations of our suppliers, including the operation of manufacturing plants, the transportation of raw materials from our suppliers, and the transportation of products to our customers, any of which may increase our costs, reduce our productivity and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nAdditionally, concern over climate change may result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change, including limitations on greenhouse gas emissions, which could increase our costs or require additional investments in our facilities and equipment. New legislation and regulatory requirements may also impact our customers and suppliers, which could affect demand for our products or our ability to source key materials. In addition, our customers and suppliers may impose their own requirements with respect to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. Any failure to comply with those requirements may also affect demand for our products or our ability to source key materials. Any failure to achieve our own goals with respect to reducing our impact on the environment, or any perception of a failure to act responsibly with respect to the environment or to effectively respond to regulatory requirements concerning climate change, can lead to adverse publicity, resulting in an adverse effect on our business or damage to our reputation.\nOur business may be materially adversely affected by risks associated with international sales and operations.\nOur international sales and operations are subject, in varying degrees, to risks inherent to doing business outside the U.S. These risks include tariffs and other trade restrictions, import and export requirements, foreign taxation policies, limitations on our ability to repatriate funds, unanticipated regulatory changes, geopolitical risks, political instability, currency fluctuations, varying levels of protection of intellectual property, difficulty enforcing agreements, disruptions in global supply chains, labor disruptions, and potential violations of anti-corruption laws.\nIn addition to the general risks that we face outside the U.S., our operations in emerging markets could involve additional uncertainties for us, including risks that an outbreak or escalation of any insurrection or armed conflict may occur; governments may seek to nationalize our assets; or governments may impose or increase investment barriers or other restrictions affecting our business.\nWe currently have operations and source and manufacture certain of our materials and products for global distribution from third-party suppliers and manufacturers in the People\u2019s Republic of China. Operating in China exposes us to political, legal, and economic risks. Our ability to operate in China may be adversely affected by changes in U.S. and Chinese relations, laws and regulations, such as those related to, among other things, taxation, import and export tariffs, environmental regulations, energy use, land use rights, intellectual property, currency controls, network security, employee benefits and other matters, and we may not obtain or retain the requisite legal permits to continue to operate in China, or we may become subject to costs or operational limitations imposed in connection with obtaining and complying with such permits. We may also experience difficulty in managing relations with our employees, distributors, suppliers, or customers, with whom disagreements or conflicts of interest could materially adversely affect our operations or our ability to source and manufacture certain of our materials and products in China.\nIf we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, or if third parties infringe our intellectual property rights or claim that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, we may suffer competitive injury, expend significant resources enforcing our rights or defending against such claims, or be prevented from selling products or services.\nWe own numerous patents, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, trade secrets and other intellectual property and hold licenses to intellectual property owned by others, which in aggregate are important to our business. The intellectual property rights that we have and may obtain, however, may not provide our products and services with a significant competitive advantage because our rights may not be sufficiently broad or may be challenged or invalidated. Our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage, adequately protect our intellectual property, or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. Any dispute or litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and time consuming due to the complexity and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation. Our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of infringement or misappropriation. We may incur significant costs and diversion of management attention and resources as a result of such claims of infringement or misappropriation, and we or our suppliers or subcontractors could lose rights to critical technology, be unable to license critical technology, provide or sell critical products or services, or be required to pay substantial damages or license fees with respect to the infringed rights or be required to redesign, rework, reprogram, or replace our or our customers\u2019 products, subcomponents, software, or systems, or recast our valuable brands at substantial cost, any of which could materially adversely impact our competitive position, financial condition and results of operations even if we successfully defend against such claims of infringement or misappropriation.\nOur industry is highly fragmented and localized.\nWe operate in markets that are characterized by customer demand that is often broad in scope but localized in delivery. We compete with companies that may be better positioned to capitalize on highly localized relationships and knowledge that are difficult for us to replicate. Our potential customers may prefer local suppliers, in some cases because of existing relationships and in other cases because of local legal restrictions or incentives that favor local businesses. Smaller regional suppliers may also have lower cost structures. As a result, efforts to expand or support our service network may not improve our ability to penetrate new local markets or expand our footprint in existing markets.\nOur contracts with federal, state, and local governments involve unique risks and may be terminated or adversely modified prior to completion, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe derive, and expect to continue to derive in the future, a portion of our revenue from government customers, including municipalities. Sales to governments and related entities present unique risks, including potential disruption due to appropriation and spending patterns, delays in the adoption of new technologies due to political, fiscal or bureaucratic processes, delays in approving budgets, long purchase and payment cycles, competitive bidding requirements, qualification requirements, extensive specification development and price negotiations, milestone requirements and the potential unenforceability of limitations on liability or other contractual provisions. Government contracts may contain provisions not typically found in commercial contracts, including provisions permitting the government to terminate for convenience, reduce scope and potential future revenue, modify certain terms and conditions of existing contracts, suspend performance, impose fines or penalties, subject us to criminal prosecution or debarment, subject awarded contracts to protests or challenges by competitors, or claim rights in technologies developed by us. Exercise of any of these rights could cause us to recognize lower revenue or margin than anticipated under our government contracts. Additionally, because our water treatment projects and solutions for municipal customers often include fixed-price contracts with milestone billings and liquidated damages for our delay, our performance under such contracts involves risks such as not receiving payments, not receiving payments in a timely manner or incurring significant damages if certain milestones are not met or not met on schedule. As a result, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nWe rely, in part, on third-party sales representatives to assist in selling our products, services and solutions, and the failure of these representatives to perform as expected could reduce our future sales.\nSales of our products, services, and solutions to some of our customers are accomplished, in part, through the efforts of third-party sales representatives. We are unable to predict the extent to which these third-party sales representatives will be successful in marketing and selling our products. Moreover, many of these third-party sales representatives also market and sell competing products and may more aggressively pursue sales of our competitors\u2019 products. Our third-party sales representatives may terminate their relationships with us at any time on short or no notice. Our future performance may also depend, in part, on our ability to attract, incentivize and retain additional third-party sales representatives that will be able to market and support our products effectively, especially in markets in which we have not previously sold our products. If we cannot retain our current third-party sales representatives or recruit additional or replacement third-party sales representatives or if these sales representatives are not effective, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nProduct defects and unanticipated or improper use of our products could adversely affect our business, reputation, and financial statements.\nManufacturing or design defects in our products or unanticipated or improper use of our products by our customers could create product safety, regulatory or other risks, including personal injury, death, or property damage. These events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products, result in the removal of a product from the market or result in product liability claims being brought against us. Recalls, removals, and product liability claims can result in significant costs, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nFurther, it is generally our responsibility to service the equipment we provide our customers throughout the duration of our contract with such customers, and our customers may be required to maintain insurance covering loss, damage or injury caused by our equipment. However, we are not able to monitor our customers\u2019 use or maintenance of their water systems or their compliance with our contracts or usage instructions. Customers\u2019 failure to properly use, maintain or safeguard their equipment or customers\u2019 noncompliance with insurance requirements may reflect poorly on us as the provider of such equipment and, as a result, damage our reputation.\nOur operations are subject to various hazards that may cause personal injury or property damage and increase our operating costs, and which may exceed the coverage of our insurance or for which we are not insured.\nThere are inherent risks to our operations. We are exposed to risks posed by severe weather and other natural disasters, such as hurricanes and earthquakes. In addition to natural risks, hazards (such as fire, explosion, collapse, or machinery failure) are inherent risks in our operations which may occur as a result of inadequate internal processes, technological flaws, human error, or certain events beyond our control. We also utilize approximately 840 vehicles in connection with our offsite services and distribution operations and, from time to time, these drivers are involved in accidents which may cause injuries, spills, or uncontrolled discharges and in which goods carried by these drivers may be lost or damaged. The hazards described above can cause significant personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property, plants, and equipment, including customer or third-party property, contamination of, or damage to, the environment and suspension of operations. The occurrence of any of these events may subject us to investigations, require us to perform remediation, or result in us being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting claims for substantial damages, environmental cleanup costs, personal injury, natural resource damages and fines or penalties. As a result, we may from time to time become exposed to significant liabilities for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage. We may also become exposed to certain claims that are excluded from our insurance coverage, such as claims of fraud or for punitive damages. Although we have liability insurance, we cannot be certain that this insurance coverage will continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost or will be adequate to cover any product liability claims. In addition, such events may affect the availability of personnel, proper functioning of our information technology infrastructure and availability of third parties on whom we rely, any of which consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nFinancial and Credit-Related Risks\nOur financial results may fluctuate from period to period and can be difficult to predict.\nOur financial results may be impacted by large projects, which often have lower margins and greater risk from both a timing and execution standpoint than standard product sales. The timing of these project awards is often unpredictable and outside of our control. If we fail to accurately estimate our operating costs to complete these projects or if we fail to execute these projects efficiently and timely, our margins on these projects could be further eroded. The timing of these project awards is often unpredictable and can change based upon customer requirements due to a number of factors affecting the project that are outside of our control, such as funding, readiness of the project and regulatory approvals. If any of these large projects get delayed or canceled, our results during the periods in which these projects were scheduled to occur could be adversely affected and the delay or failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. In addition, our contracts for large capital water treatment projects, systems and solutions for municipal and industrial applications are generally fixed-price contracts with milestone billings. Additionally, competitive-bid processes impose significant uncertainty with respect to our prospects for success, and our failure to properly predict our win rate could reduce our margins. Accordingly, our financial results for any given period may fluctuate and can be difficult to predict.\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and limit our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of September 30, 2021, we had total indebtedness of $754.9 million, including $473.8 million of borrowings under our term loan facility, $37.3 million borrowings under our revolving credit facility, $150.1 million of borrowings related to our Securitization facility which includes $0.1 million of accrued interest, $93.4 million in borrowings related to equipment financings, and $0.4 million of notes payable related to certain equipment related contracts. We also had $10.1 million of letters of credit issued under our $350.0 million revolving credit facility. We cannot provide any assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in amounts sufficient to enable us to fund our debt service obligations and other liquidity needs. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects.\nOur high level of indebtedness could, among other things, limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future, reduce the amount of cash available for working capital, capital expenditures and other business needs, increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in the economy, expose us to greater interest rate risk, restrict us from making strategic acquisitions, force us to make non-strategic divestitures, place us at a disadvantage compared to less leveraged competitors, and increase our costs of borrowing. Any one of these impacts could have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects, and our ability to satisfy our obligations in respect of our outstanding debt.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under our senior secured credit facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. Interest rates are still near historically low levels and are projected to rise in the future. If interest rates rise, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed may remain the same, and our net income and cash flows will correspondingly decrease. Assuming no prepayments of the term loan facility (which had $473.8 million outstanding as of September 30, 2021) and that our revolving credit facility was fully drawn, each 0.125% change in interest rates would result in an approximate change of $1.0 million in annual interest expense on the indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities. We entered into an interest rate swap during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 to mitigate risks associated with variable rate debt. The interest rate swap became effective June 30, 2020, has a term of five years to hedge the variability of interest payments on the first $500.0 million of the Company\u2019s senior secured debt and provides for a fixed rate of 0.61%.\nThe covenants in our senior secured credit facilities impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility.\nOur senior secured credit facilities contain a number of significant restrictions and covenants that limit our ability, among other things, to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends on or repurchase our outstanding capital stock, prepay certain indebtedness, create certain liens, divest certain assets, make certain investments, and enter into new lines of business.\nIn addition, our senior secured credit facilities contain a financial covenant requiring us to comply with a 5.55 to 1.00 first lien net leverage ratio test. This financial covenant is solely for the benefit of the lenders under our revolving credit facility and is tested as of the last day of a quarter on which the aggregate amount of revolving loans and letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit facility (net of cash collateralized letters of credit and undrawn outstanding letters of credit in an amount of up to 50% of the revolving credit facility) exceeds 12.5% of the total commitments thereunder.\nThese covenants could materially adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs. Furthermore, they may restrict our ability to expand and pursue our business strategies and otherwise conduct our business. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by circumstances and events beyond our control, such as prevailing economic conditions and changes in regulations, and we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to comply with such covenants. These restrictions also limit our ability to obtain future financings to withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general. In addition, complying with these covenants may also cause us to take actions that may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions.\nA breach of any covenant in our senior secured credit facilities or the agreements and indentures governing any other indebtedness that we may have outstanding from time to time would result in a default under that agreement or indenture after any applicable grace periods. A default, if not waived, could result in acceleration of the debt outstanding under the agreement and in a default with respect to, and an acceleration of, the debt outstanding under other debt agreements. If that occurs, we may not be able to make all of the required payments or borrow sufficient funds to refinance such debt. Even if new financing were available at that time, it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us or terms as favorable as our current agreements. If our debt is in default for any reason, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nSeasonality of sales and weather conditions may adversely affect, or cause volatility in, our financial results.\nWe experience seasonal demand in a number of our end markets, as demand for infrastructure and municipal products and projects generally follows warm weather trends. Seasonal effects may vary from year to year and are impacted by weather patterns, particularly by temperatures, heavy flooding, and droughts. Our operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected by severe weather, natural disasters, or other environmental factors. Repercussions of these catastrophic events may include shutting down operations, a need to obtain additional equipment or supplies on an emergency basis, evacuation of or injury to personnel, damage to equipment or property, loss of productivity and harm to our reputation, any of which may result in a decrease in our revenue or decreased profitability.\nWe may incur impairment charges for our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets which would negatively impact our operating results.\nWe have a significant amount of goodwill and purchased intangible assets on our balance sheet. As of September 30, 2021, the net carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled approximately $441.6 million. The carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of an acquired business in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date. The carrying value of indefinite-lived intangible assets represents the federal hazardous waste treatment management permits obtained for locations operated by the Company. We do not amortize goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets that we expect to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows, but instead we evaluate these assets for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if changes in circumstances indicate that a potential impairment could exist. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected significant changes, or planned changes in use of the assets,\ndivestitures and market capitalization declines may impair our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. Any charges relating to such impairments could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited.\nAs of September 30, 2021, we had approximately $297.1 million of U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d). Our federal NOLs begin to expire in 2035, while certain state NOLs began to expire in 2019. Utilization of these NOLs depends on many factors, including our future income, which cannot be assured. We maintain a full valuation allowance against these NOLs.\nWe may be unable to bid on or enter into significant long-term agreements if we are not able to obtain letters of credit, bank guarantees or surety bonds, and our liquidity may be adversely affected by bonding requirements.\nA portion of our business, including our water treatment projects and solutions, requires us to provide letters of credit, bank guarantees or surety bonds in support of our commitments and as part of the terms and conditions on water treatment projects. In addition, we are required to provide letters of credit or surety bonds to the department of environmental protection or equivalent in some states in order to maintain our licenses to handle hazardous waste at certain of our regeneration facilities. We have in the past been, and may in the future be, required to provide bid bonds or performance bonds to secure our performance on certain projects or, in some cases, as a pre-requisite to submit a bid on a potential project. Our inability to obtain adequate bonding or letters of credit to meet bid requirements or enter into significant long-term agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nInformation Technology and Cybersecurity Risks\nWe are increasingly dependent on the continuous and reliable operation of our information technology systems, and a disruption of these systems could materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on our information technology systems in connection with various aspects of the operation of our business, including customer relationship management, customer service, purchasing, inventory management, project management, human resource management, billing, and accounting. We also rely on digitally connected systems for monitoring and operation of certain of our water treatment installations. Many of our products, services and solutions depend on the integrity of our information technology systems, including our remote monitoring and data analytics features and our automated control solutions. These systems are inherently susceptible a number of threats, including, but not limited to, viruses, ransomware, malware, malicious codes, hacking, phishing, denial of service actions, human error, network failures, electronic loss of data, and other electronic security breaches. Although we have experienced attempts by external parties to access our networks and systems, these attempts have not resulted in any material breaches, disruptions, or loss of information to date. A successful cyber-attack may result in the loss or compromise of customer, financial or operational data, theft of intellectual property, disruption of billing, collections or normal field service activities, disruption of data analytics and electronic monitoring and control of operational systems, loss of revenue, ransomware payments, remediation costs related to lost, stolen, or compromised data, repairs to infrastructure, physical systems or data processing systems, increased cybersecurity protection costs, or violation of U.S. and international privacy laws, which may result in litigation. Any of these occurrences could harm our reputation or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and prospects.\nWe have adopted measures to mitigate potential risks associated with information technology disruptions and cybersecurity threats; however, there is no assurance that these measures will prevent cyber-attacks or security breaches. We also have a concentration of operations on certain sites, such as production and shared services centers, where business interruptions could cause material damage and costs. Although we continue to assess these risks, implement controls and perform business continuity and disaster recovery planning, we cannot be sure that interruptions with material adverse effects will not occur.\nOur Water One\u00ae services are provided using remote monitoring technology that is connected to the \u201cInternet of Things\u201d (IoT), which is inherently susceptible to cyber-attacks and outages. A successful attack may result in inappropriate access to our or our customers\u2019 information or systems or cause our products to function improperly. We have experienced outages due to disruptions in service by cellular providers. Although these outages have not had a\nmaterial impact on our business to date, if outages occur with greater frequency or for extended durations, it could adversely affect our ability to monitor our assets, which could harm our reputation or result in a loss of revenue, failure to fulfill contractual obligations and additional costs to repair damages.\nIf we experience a significant data security breach or fail to detect and appropriately respond to a significant data security breach, our business and reputation could suffer.\nThe nature of our business involves the receipt and storage of information about our customers, suppliers, employees, operations and financial performance. Further, we rely on various information technology systems to capture, process, store, and report data in connection with the products, services, and solutions that we provide to our customers, such as our Water One\u00ae services. We have procedures in place to detect and respond to data security incidents. However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable, or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. In addition, hardware, software, or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. We outsource administration of certain functions to vendors that could be targets of cyber attacks. Any theft, loss and/or fraudulent use of customer, employee, or proprietary data as a result of a cyber attack targeting us or one of our third-party service providers could subject us to significant litigation, liability, and costs, as well as adversely impact our reputation with customers and regulators, among others. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities and to our proprietary business information. If our efforts to protect the security of information about our customers, suppliers and employees are unsuccessful, a significant data security breach may result in costly government enforcement actions, private litigation and negative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage with customers, and our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could suffer. While we maintain insurance coverage that is designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the event we experience a cybersecurity incident, data breach or disruption, unauthorized access, or failure of systems.\nWe are subject to laws, rules, and regulations in the United States (such as the California Consumer Protection Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d)), and other countries relating to the collection, use and security of employee and other data. Our ability to execute transactions and to possess and use personal information and data in conducting our business subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens that may require us to notify regulators and customers, employees, and other individuals of a data security breach, including in the European Union under the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR. Evolving compliance and operational requirements under the GDPR, the CCPA, and the privacy laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nThe cost of complying with complex governmental regulations applicable to our business, sanctions resulting from non-compliance or reduced demand resulting from certain changes in regulations could increase our operating costs and reduce our profit.\nOur operations are subject to various licensing, permitting, approval and reporting requirements imposed by federal, state, local and foreign laws. Our operations are subject to inspection and regulation by various governmental agencies, including the U.S. EPA, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and equivalent state and local agencies, as well as their counterparts in various states and foreign countries. A major risk inherent in our operations is the need to obtain and renew permits from federal, state, and local authorities. Delays in obtaining permits, the failure to obtain a permit or a renewal permit for a project, challenges to our permits by local communities, citizen groups, landowners or others opposed to their issuance or the issuance of a permit with unreasonable conditions or costs could limit our ability to effectively provide our services. We are also required to secure and maintain licenses required by several states which can take a significant amount of time and result in our inability or delays in our ability to bid on and execute certain projects. If we fail to secure or maintain any such licenses or if states place burdensome restrictions or limitations on our ability to obtain or maintain such licenses, we may not be able to operate in such states and our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects may be materially adversely affected as a result.\nOur business may be further impacted by changes in federal, state, and local requirements that set forth air and wastewater discharge parameters, constrain water availability and set quality and treatment standards. Our failure or inability to comply with the stringent standards set forth by regulating entities or to provide cost-effective and compliant design and construction solutions could result in fines or other penalties, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nForeign, federal, state, and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations impose substantial compliance requirements on our operations. Our operating costs could be significantly increased in order to comply with new or stricter regulatory standards imposed by foreign, federal, and state environmental agencies.\nOur operations, products and services are governed by various foreign, federal, state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations, including, without limitation, the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act in the U.S., the Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals, or REACH, directive in Europe, and similar foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations and permits issued under these laws by the foreign, federal, state and local environmental and health and safety regulatory agencies. These laws and regulations establish, among other things, criteria and standards for drinking water and for discharges into the waters of the U.S. and its states, for the proper management of hazardous and non-hazardous solid waste and for protection of public and worker health and safety. Pursuant to these laws, we are required to obtain various environmental permits from environmental regulatory agencies for our operations. We cannot provide any assurance that our operations, products, or services will be at all times in total compliance with these laws, regulations and permits or that we will be able to obtain or renew all required permits. If we violate or fail to comply with these laws, regulations or permits, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators and be subject to lawsuits, civil or criminal, seeking enforcement and/or injunctive relief. We may also be subject to civil claims by citizens groups seeking to enforce environmental laws. In the event of an accident or if we otherwise fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could lose our permits or approvals and/or be held liable for damages and monetary penalties.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations are complex and change frequently. These laws, and the enforcement thereof, have tended to become more stringent over time. It is possible that new standards could be imposed, either stricter or more lenient, that could result in the obsolescence of our products or lead to an interruption or suspension of our operations and have a material adverse effect on the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility, service, or product or on us as a whole.\nFailure to comply with applicable anti-corruption and trade laws, regulations, and policies, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, could result in fines and criminal penalties, causing a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nDue to our global operations, we are subject to regulation under a wide variety of U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. laws, regulations and policies related to anti-corruption and trade, including those related to export and import compliance, anti-trust and money laundering. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We operate in parts of the world that are recognized as high-risk regions for corruption. Our operations in these regions include sales to government and non-government customers and may include the use of third-party intermediaries. In certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery and trade laws, regulations and policies may conflict with local customs and practices in these regions.\nThe International Traffic in Arms Regulations generally require export licenses from the U.S. Department of State for goods, technical data and services sent outside the U.S. that have military or strategic applications. The Export Administration Regulations regulate the export of certain \u201cdual use\u201d goods, software, and technologies, and in some cases require export licenses from the U.S. Department of Commerce. Office of Foreign Asset Control regulations implement various sanctions programs that include prohibitions of restrictions on dealings with certain sanctioned countries, governments, entities, and individuals. Our policies mandate compliance with these trade laws, regulations, and policies, and we have established procedures designed to assist us and our personnel in compliance with applicable\nU.S. and international laws and regulations. However, we cannot provide any assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from improper conduct of our employees or business partners.\nIn the event that we believe or have reason to believe that our employees or agents have or may have violated applicable laws, including anti-corruption and trade laws, regulations, and policies, we may be required to investigate or engage outside counsel to investigate the relevant facts and circumstances, which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management. Any such violation could result in substantial fines, sanctions, civil and/or criminal penalties, imprisonment, disgorgement of profits, debarment from government contracts and curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions, and might materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. In addition, actual or alleged violations could damage our reputation and diminish our ability to do business. Furthermore, detecting, investigating, and resolving actual or alleged violations is expensive and can consume significant time and attention of our senior management.", "PERMNO": 17035, "SIC": 3580, "TIC": "AQUA"}
