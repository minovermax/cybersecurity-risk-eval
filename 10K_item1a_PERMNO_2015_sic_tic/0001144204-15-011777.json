{"cik": "1333513", "company": "Dealertrack Technologies, Inc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as the more detailed descriptions of our business elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by the following:\nEconomic trends that affect the automotive retail industry or the indirect automotive financing industry may have a negative effect on our business.\nEconomic trends that negatively affect the automotive retail industry or the indirect automotive financing industry may adversely affect our business by further reducing the amount of indirect automobile financing transactions that we earn revenue on, the number of lender or automotive dealer customers that subscribe to our products and services, or money that our customers spend on our products and services. Purchases of new automobiles are typically discretionary for consumers and have been, and may continue to be, affected by negative trends in the economy, including the cost of energy and gasoline, the availability and cost of credit, increased federal and other taxation, residential and commercial real estate markets, reductions in business and consumer confidence, stock market volatility and increased unemployment, as well as due to other factors, such as longer warranties and higher quality vehicles, which may reduce the overall number of vehicles purchased during consumers\u2019 lifetimes, disruptions in available inventories of vehicles and pricing and purchase incentives for vehicles. A reduction in the number of automobiles purchased by consumers could adversely affect our lender and dealer customers and lead to a reduction in transaction volumes and in spending by these customers on our subscription products and services. While new car sales increased in 2014, they remain below historical levels. Additionally, a certain number of our lender customers are dependent on continued access to the capital markets, in order to fund their lending activities. These factors may result in our lenders further reducing the number of automobile dealers that they service or the number of contracts that they purchase which could result in a reduction in the number of credit applications that are processed through our network. Additionally, due to the economic downturn, there has been a consolidation of automotive dealers and the number of franchised automotive dealers has declined in 2009 and 2010 in North America and Western Europe. Although these declines have stabilized in North America, and the pace of declines in Western Europe has slowed, any future consolidation of dealers with subscriptions to our products may result in cancellation of those products. Further, a reduction in the number of automotive dealers reduces the number of opportunities we have to sell our subscription products. Additionally, dealers who close their businesses may choose to not pay those amounts owed to us, resulting in an increase in our bad debts.\nAny of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may face increased competition or be unable to continue to compete effectively in our industry.\nCompetition in the automotive retail technology industry is intense. The automotive retail technology industry is highly fragmented and subject to changing technologies, shifting customer needs and frequent introductions of new solutions, and is served by a variety of entities, including DMS providers, digital marketing companies, web-based automotive finance credit application processors, the proprietary credit application processing systems of the lender affiliates of automobile manufacturers, automotive retail sales desking providers and vehicle configuration providers. Dealertrack also competes with warranty and insurance providers, as well as software providers, among others, in the market for websites, advertising, DMS, menu-selling products and services, compliance products, electronic registration solutions, and inventory management solutions. Some of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do. Many of these competitors also have longstanding relationships with dealers and may offer dealers other products and services that we do not provide. As a result, these companies may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer demands or to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products and services than we can to ours. We expect the market to continue to attract new competitors and new technologies, possibly involving alternative technologies that are more sophisticated and cost-effective than our products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures we face will not materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nCDK and Reynolds and Reynolds, the two largest providers of DMS systems, have formed Open Dealer Exchange (ODE) as a joint venture to compete in online credit application processing and routing. CDK and Reynolds and Reynolds are also the owners of CVR, a joint venture that competes in the electronic registration solution space. ODE plans to leverage its owners\u2019 penetration of the DMS space to better integrate the loan origination process into the dealer\u2019s transactional, point-of-sale system, thereby giving them a competitive advantage. Additionally, our network of lenders does not include the captive lenders affiliated with Ford Motor Company or Toyota Motor Corporation, two of the owners of RouteOne. This gives RouteOne the ability to offer its dealers access to captive or other lenders that are not in our network. A significant number of independent lenders, including many of the independent lenders in our network, are participating on the RouteOne credit application processing and routing portal. If either ODE and/or RouteOne increases the number of independent lenders on its credit application processing and routing portal and/or offers products and services that better address the needs of our customers or offer our customers a lower-cost alternative, or more integrated systems, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, if a substantial amount of our current customers migrate from our network to ODE or RouteOne, our ability to sell additional products and services to, or earn transaction services revenue from, these customers could diminish.\nWe believe that both ODE and RouteOne have repeatedly approached certain of our largest lender customers seeking to have them join their credit application processing and routing portal. In addition, CU Direct Corporation, through its CUDL portal, has directly targeted credit unions, which comprise a large number of our lender customers, and ODE has an integration agreement with CUDL. Finance Express and AppOne have targeted lenders that serve the independent dealer channel.\nOur lender customers may elect to use competing third-party services, either in addition to or instead of our network.\nOur lender customers continue to receive credit applications and purchase retail installment sales and lease contracts directly from their dealer customers through traditional indirect financing methods, including via facsimile and other electronic means of communication, in addition to using our network. Many of our lender customers are involved in other ventures as participants and/or as equity holders, and such ventures or newly created ventures may compete with us and our network now and in the future. Expanded use of alternative methods to ours, including direct lending, by these lender customers may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nSome vendors of software products used by automotive dealers, including certain of our competitors, are designing their software and using financial or other incentives to make it more difficult or impossible for our customers to use our products and services.\nCurrently, some software vendors, including some of our competitors, have designed their software systems in order to make it difficult or impossible to integrate with third-party products and services such as ours and others have announced their intention to do so. Some software vendors also use financial or other incentives to encourage their customers to purchase such vendors\u2019 products and services. These obstacles make it more difficult for us to compete with these vendors and could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. While we have agreements in place with various third-party software providers to facilitate integration between their software and our network, we cannot assure you that each of these agreements will remain in place or that during the terms of these agreements these third parties will not increase the cost or level of difficulty in maintaining integration with their software. Additionally, we integrate certain of our solutions and services with other third parties\u2019 software programs. These third parties may charge us a cost prohibitive fee for integration, or design or utilize their software in a manner that makes it more difficult for us to continue to integrate our solutions and services in the same manner, or at all. These developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur systems and network may be subject to security breaches, interruptions, failures and/or other errors or may be harmed by other events beyond our control.\nOur systems may be subject to security breaches.\nOur success depends on the confidence of dealers, lenders, OEMs, major credit reporting agencies and our other network users/participants and data providers in our ability to store, process and transmit confidential information securely over the Internet or otherwise and operate our computer systems and operations without significant disruption or failure. We transmit substantial amounts of confidential information, including non-public personal information of consumers, over the Internet. Moreover, even if our security measures are adequate, concerns over the security of third party data that we store, process and transmit and commercial online services, which may be heightened by any well-publicized compromise of security, may deter customers from using our products and services and/or deter vendors from providing their products to us. If our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to confidential information, our network may be perceived as not being secure and our customers may curtail or stop using our network or other systems and/or vendors may curtail or stop providing their products to us. Any failure of, or lack of confidence in, our secure online products and services could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nLarge commercial, healthcare, and financial entities with sophisticated security operations have been impacted by security breaches through malware and unintended system entry through compromised credentials or by other advanced means. Despite our focus on data security, we may not be able to stop unauthorized attempts to gain access to data that we store, process and transmit or to stop disruptions in the transmission or provision of data and communications among our network participants. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography, or other events or developments could result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms used by our products and services to protect data contained in our, our customers\u2019 and/or our vendors\u2019 databases and the information being stored, processed or transferred.\nAlthough we generally limit warranties and liabilities relating to data and system security in our customer and vendor contracts, they or third parties may seek to hold us liable for any losses suffered as a result of unauthorized access to their confidential information or non-public personal information of their customers. In addition, we may not have limited our warranties and liabilities sufficiently or have adequate insurance to cover these losses. We may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against security breaches and/or to alleviate the problems caused. Our security measures may not be sufficient to prevent security breaches, and any failure to prevent security breaches and/or alleviate any problems caused by security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur network and systems may be vulnerable to interruptions or failures.\nFrom time to time, we have experienced, and may experience in the future, network or system slowdowns and interruptions. These network and system slowdowns and interruptions may interfere with our ability to do business. Although we believe we have made and are continuing to make the appropriate upgrades to our system, regularly back up data and take other measures to protect against data loss and system failures, there is still risk that we may lose critical data or experience network failures. Such failures or disruptions may result in lost revenue opportunities for our customers, which could result in litigation against us or a loss of customers. Additionally, we have service level agreements with certain of our customers that may result in penalties or trigger cancelation rights in the event of a network slowdown or interruption. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nReal or perceived errors or failures in our software and systems could negatively impact our results of operations and growth prospects.\nWe depend upon the sustained and uninterrupted performance of numerous proprietary and third-party technologies to deliver our products. If one or more of those technologies cannot scale to meet demand, or if there are errors in our execution of any feature or functionality using any such technologies, then our business may be harmed. Because our software is often complex, undetected errors and failures may occur, especially when new versions or updates are made. Despite testing by us, errors or bugs in our products or in third-party programs integrated with our products may not be found until the software or service is in active use by us or our customers. Moreover, our customers could incorrectly implement or inadvertently misuse our products, which could result in customers\u2019 dissatisfaction and adversely impact the perceived utility of our products as well as our brand. Any of these real or perceived errors, failures or bugs could result in negative publicity, reputational harm, loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products, loss of competitive position or claims by customers for losses sustained by them, all of which, along with the costs of responding to such effects, may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur systems may be harmed by events beyond our control.\nOur computer systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, such as fires, floods and hurricanes, or from power outages, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, network service outages and disruptions, \u201cdenial of service\u201d attacks, computer viruses, break-ins, sabotage and other similar events beyond our control. The occurrence of any such event at our facilities in the New York metropolitan area, or at any third-party facility we utilize, such as the production centers we use in Piscataway, New Jersey and in the Netherlands, or the disaster recovery center we use in Waltham, Massachusetts, could cause interruptions or delays in our business, loss of data or could render us unable to provide our products and services. In addition, the failure of a third-party facility to provide the data communications capacity required by us, as a result of human error, bankruptcy, natural disaster or other operational disruption, could cause interruptions to our computer systems and operations. The occurrence of any or all of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny acquisitions that we complete may dilute your ownership interest in us, may have adverse effects on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations and may cause unanticipated liabilities.\nFuture acquisitions may involve the issuance of our equity securities as payment, in part or in full, for the businesses or assets acquired. Any future issuances of equity securities would further dilute our existing stockholders\u2019 ownership interests. Future acquisitions may also decrease our earnings or earnings per share and the benefits derived by us from an acquisition might not outweigh or might not exceed the dilutive effect of the acquisition. We also may incur additional indebtedness, have future impairment of assets, or suffer adverse tax and accounting consequences in connection with any future acquisitions. Furthermore, operating decisions may impact existing products and platforms. If any of these decisions are expected to potentially result in the limitation or discontinuation of use of certain assets, we would expect accelerated depreciation and potential impairment of assets including property and equipment, software and website development costs, intangible assets or goodwill.\nIn addition, any changes in the operating structure of the business post acquisition may result in changes in asset groups, segments, or reporting units which could also result in certain asset impairments.\nWe may not successfully integrate recent or future acquisitions.\nThe integration of acquisitions involves a number of risks and presents financial, managerial and operational challenges. We may have difficulty, and may incur unanticipated expenses related to, integrating management and personnel from these acquired entities with our management and personnel. Failure to successfully integrate recent acquisitions or future acquisitions in a timely manner, or at all, could impair our ability to take advantage of efficiencies or reduce redundancies of an acquisition or to realize any or all of the other anticipated benefits of the acquisitions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have made strategic acquisitions and formed alliances in the past and intend to do so in the future. If we are unable to find suitable acquisitions or partners or to achieve expected benefits from such acquisitions or alliances, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nSince 2001, we have acquired numerous businesses, including, most recently, our acquisitions of Dealer.com in March 2014, ASR Pro in July 2014, and incadea in January 2015. As part of our ongoing business strategy to expand product offerings, acquire new technology and strengthen our value proposition to customers, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding, and enter into agreements relating to, possible acquisitions, strategic alliances and joint ventures. There may be significant competition for acquisition, alliance and joint venture targets in our industry, or we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or negotiate attractive terms for acquisitions. If we are unable to identify future acquisition opportunities, reach agreement with such third parties or obtain the financing necessary to make such acquisitions, we could lose market share to competitors who are able to make such acquisitions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nEven if we are able to complete acquisitions or enter into alliances and joint ventures that we believe will be successful, such transactions are inherently risky. Significant risks to these transactions include the following:\n\u2022\nintegration and restructuring costs, both one-time and ongoing;\n\u2022\ndeveloping and maintaining sufficient controls, policies and procedures;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from ongoing business operations;\n\u2022\nestablishing new informational, operational and financial systems to meet the needs of our business;\n\u2022\nlosing key employees, customers and vendors;\n\u2022\nfailing to achieve anticipated synergies, including with respect to complementary products or services; and\n\u2022\nunanticipated and unknown liabilities.\nIf we are not successful in completing acquisitions in the future, we may be required to reevaluate our acquisition strategy. We also may incur substantial expenses and devote significant management time and resources in seeking to complete acquisitions. In addition, we could use substantial portions of our available cash to pay all or a portion of the purchase prices of future acquisitions. If we do not achieve the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions as rapidly to the extent anticipated by our management and financial or industry analysts, others may not perceive the same benefits of the acquisition as we do. If these risks materialize, there could be a material adverse effect on our stock price, business, prospects, financial condition and results of operation.\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us from making payments on the debt.\nAs of February 1, 2015, we had debt outstanding in the form of our senior convertible notes, our term loan B credit facility, our revolving credit facility and multiple instances of notes payable. We may also incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt will depend on a range of economic, competitive, regulatory and business factors, many of which are outside our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our debt service and other obligations, and currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements may not be realized on schedule, or at all. If we are unable to meet our expenses and debt service and other obligations, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity, reduce or discontinue dividends we may pay in the future, reduce or delay business activities, investments or capital expenditures, sell assets or raise equity. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations, or we may not be able to effect these actions on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms, would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur expected substantial indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:\n\u2022\nit may limit our ability to borrow money (if necessary) for our working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, strategic initiatives (including acquisitions) or other purposes;\n\u2022\nit may make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions, could result in an event of default under the agreements governing such indebtedness, which could further result in an event of default under other instruments due to cross-default and cross-acceleration provisions in such instruments;\n\u2022\na substantial portion of our cash flow from operations will be dedicated to the payment of principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, including our senior convertible notes, term loan B credit facility, our revolving credit facility and multiple instances of notes payable and so will not be available for operations, future business opportunities, potential dividends to our stockholders or other purposes;\n\u2022\nit may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our operations or business;\n\u2022\nwe will be more highly leveraged than some of our competitors, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage;\n\u2022\nit may make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business or the economy generally;\n\u2022\nit may restrict us from making strategic acquisitions, introducing new technologies or exploiting business opportunities; and\n\u2022\nit may limit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds or dispose of assets.\nFurthermore, our interest expense could increase if interest rates increase because a portion of the debt under our new senior secured credit facilities is variable-rate debt.\nDespite our substantial indebtedness, we may still be able to incur significantly more debt. This could intensify the risks described above.\nThe terms of our senior secured credit facilities contain restrictions on our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to incur additional indebtedness. However, these restrictions will be subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions, and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Accordingly, we or our subsidiaries could incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. The more leveraged we become, the more we, and in turn our securityholders, become exposed to the risks described above.\nThe terms of our new senior secured credit facilities may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to take certain actions.\nOur senior secured credit facilities contain, and any future indebtedness of ours would likely contain, a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional debt;\n\u2022\npay dividends and make other restricted payments;\n\u2022\ncreate or incur certain liens;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments;\n\u2022\nengage in sales of assets and subsidiary stock;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\ntransfer all or substantially all of our assets or enter into merger or consolidation transactions; and\n\u2022\nmake capital expenditures.\nIn addition, our revolving credit facility is expected to require us to maintain a first lien leverage ratio. As a result of these covenants, we will be limited in the manner in which we conduct our business, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs.\nA failure to comply with the covenants contained in our senior secured credit facilities or our other indebtedness could result in an event of default under the facilities or indebtedness of other agreements, which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In the event of any default under our senior secured credit facilities or our other indebtedness, the lenders thereunder:\n\u2022\nwill not be required to lend any additional amounts to us;\n\u2022\ncould elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be due and payable;\n\u2022\nrequire us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings; or\n\u2022\nprevent us from making debt service payments, any of which could result in an event of default under our indebtedness.\nIf the indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities or our other indebtedness, including the senior convertible notes, were to be accelerated, there can be no assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full.\nOur business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed by negative rating actions by credit rating agencies.\nIf our credit rating is downgraded or if ratings agencies indicate that a downgrade may occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted and perceptions of our financial strength could be damaged. Any of these outcomes could negatively impact our relationships with our customers, increase our costs of borrowing money or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our intangible assets and goodwill become impaired we may be required to record a significant non-cash charge to earnings which would negatively impact our results of operations.\nUnder generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we review our intangible assets, including goodwill, for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be fully recoverable. The carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable due to factors such as a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, reduced estimates of future cash flows or slower growth rates in our industry. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a long-term financial outlook of our operations. Actual performance in the near-term or long-term could be materially different from these forecasts, which could impact future estimates and the recorded value of the intangibles. For example, a significant, sustained decline in our stock price and market capitalization may result in impairment of certain of our intangible assets, including goodwill, and a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which an impairment is determined to exist. We will continue to monitor and evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill. In the event we had to reduce the carrying value of our goodwill, any such impairment charge could materially reduce our results of operations.\nOur failure or inability to execute any element of our business strategy could adversely affect our operations.\nOur business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations depend on our ability to execute our business strategy, which includes the following key elements:\n\u2022\ncontinuing to expand our customer base in the United States and internationally;\n\u2022\ndeepening our relationship with our existing customers;\n\u2022\nstrengthening and expanding our product offerings and operations;\n\u2022\ndriving additional operational efficiency; and\n\u2022\nselectively pursuing acquisitions and strategic alliances.\nWe may not succeed in implementing a portion or all of our business strategy and, even if we do succeed, our strategy may not have the favorable impact on our operations or financial condition that we anticipate. Our success depends on our ability to leverage our distribution channel and value proposition for dealers, lenders, OEMs, and other service and information providers; offer a broad array of solutions; provide convenient, high-quality products and services; maintain our technological position; and implement other elements of our business strategy.\nWe may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or achieve the rapid execution necessary to fully avail ourselves of the market opportunity for our products and services. If we are unable to adequately implement our business strategy, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could suffer a material adverse effect.\nWe may need additional capital in the future, which may not be available to us, and if we raise additional capital, it may dilute our stockholders\u2019 ownership in us or cause our stockholders to be subordinated to the rights of senior securityholders.\nWe may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to meet various objectives, such as:\n\u2022\nacquiring businesses, customers, technologies, products and services;\n\u2022\ntaking advantage of growth opportunities, including more rapid expansion;\n\u2022\nmaking capital improvements to increase our capacity;\n\u2022\ndeveloping new services or products or funding product development requirements; and\n\u2022\nresponding to competitive pressures.\nAny additional capital raised through the sale of equity, or convertible debt securities, may dilute our stockholders\u2019 respective ownership percentages in us. Furthermore, any additional debt or equity financing we may need may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If future financing is not available or is not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to raise additional capital, which could significantly limit our ability to implement our business plan or grow our business. In addition, we may issue securities, including debt securities or preferred stock, that may have liquidation rights, preferences and privileges senior to our common stock.\nOur revenue, operating results and profitability will vary from quarter to quarter, which may result in volatility in our stock price.\nOur revenue, operating results and profitability have varied in the past and are likely to continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter, which may lead to volatility in our stock price. These variations are due to several factors related to the number of transactions we process and to the number of subscriptions or licenses to our products and services, including:\n\u2022\nthe volume of new and used automobiles financed or leased by our participating lender customers;\n\u2022\nthe timing, size and nature of our subscriptions or licenses and any cancellations or revenue losses with respect thereto;\n\u2022\nproduct and price competition regarding our products and services and those of our participating lenders;\n\u2022\nthe timing of introduction and market acceptance of new products, services or product enhancements by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in our operating expenses;\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations, particularly the U.S. dollar vs. the Canadian dollar and vs. the Euro;\n\u2022\nthe timing and size of implementations related to OEMs who purchase subscriptions or licenses to our international DMS products;\n\u2022\nthe timing of acquisitions or divestitures of businesses, products and services;\n\u2022\nautomobile manufacturers or their captive lenders offering special incentive programs such as discount pricing or low cost financing;\n\u2022\nthe seasonality of car sales;\n\u2022\nour unpredictable sales cycles;\n\u2022\npersonnel changes; and\n\u2022\nfluctuations in economic and financial market conditions.\nAs a result of these fluctuations, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations may not necessarily be meaningful. We cannot assure you that future revenue and results of operations will not vary substantially from quarter to quarter. It is also possible that in future quarters, our results of operations will be below the expectations of equity research analysts, investors or our announced guidance. In any of these cases, the price of our stock could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to develop and bring products and services in development and new products and services to market in a timely manner.\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to bring to market the products and services that we have in development and offer new products and services that meet changing customer needs. The time, expense and effort associated with developing and offering these new products and services may be greater than anticipated. The length of the development cycle varies depending on the nature and complexity of the product, the availability of development, product management and other internal resources, and the role, if any, of strategic partners. If we are unable to develop and bring additional products and services to market in a timely manner, we could lose market share to competitors who are able to offer these additional products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are directly and indirectly subject to, and impacted by, extensive and complex regulation in the U.S., Canada and foreign jurisdictions, and new regulations and/or changes to existing regulations may adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe indirect automotive financing and automotive retail industries are subject to extensive and complex regulation in the U.S. (federal and state), Canada and foreign jurisdictions.\nWe are directly and indirectly subject to, and impacted by, numerous laws and regulations in the U.S., Canada and foreign jurisdictions covering a wide variety of subject matters. Compliance with these laws and regulations increases our costs and may impede our competitiveness. In addition, failure to comply with such laws or regulations may result in the suspension or termination of our ability to do business in applicable jurisdictions or the imposition of civil and criminal penalties, including fines or exposure to civil litigation. Any such incurred fines, penalties or other liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nFederal laws and regulations governing privacy and security of consumer information generally apply in the context of our business to our customers and/or to us as a service provider. These include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the GLB Act) and regulations implementing its information safeguarding requirements, the Interagency Guidelines Establishing Information Security Standards, the Interagency Guidance on Response Programs for Unauthorized Access to Customer Information and Customer Notice, Office of Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and Federal Reserve Board (FRB) Administrative Guidelines - Implementation of Interagency Programs for the Supervision of Technology Service Providers, the Junk Fax Prevention Act of 2005, the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, the Do-Not-Call-Implementation Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and applicable Federal Communications Commission (FCC) telemarketing rules, and the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s (FTC) Privacy Rule, Safeguards Rule, Consumer Report Information Disposal Rule, Telemarketing Sales Rule, Risk-Based Pricing Rule, and Red Flags Rule, as well as regulations promulgated by the FRB, FDIC, OCC, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). International laws, such as the European Union\u2019s Data Protection Directive, and the country-specific regulations that implement that directive, similarly apply to our collection, storage, use and transmission of protected data. If we, or a lender or dealer discloses or uses consumer information provided through our system in violation of these or other laws or regulations, or engage in other prohibited conduct, we may be subject to claims or enforcement actions by state, federal or foreign regulators. We cannot predict whether such claims or enforcement actions will arise or the extent to which, if at all, we may be held liable. Such claims or enforcement actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, a majority of states, Canada and multiple foreign jurisdictions have passed, or are currently contemplating, consumer protection, privacy, and data security laws or regulations that may relate to our business. The FCRA contains certain provisions that explicitly preempt some state laws to the extent the state laws seek to regulate certain specified areas, including the responsibilities of persons furnishing information to consumer reporting agencies. Unlike the FCRA, however, the GLB Act does not limit the ability of the states to enact privacy legislation that provides greater protections to consumers than those provided by the GLB Act. Some state legislatures or regulatory agencies have imposed, and other states and foreign jurisdictions may impose, greater restrictions on the disclosure of consumer information than are already contained in the GLB Act and its implementing regulations, the Interagency Guidelines or the FTC\u2019s rules. It is possible that in the future, U.S. and foreign jurisdictions may adopt legislation or regulations that impair our ability to effectively track consumers\u2019 use of our digital marketing services, such as the FTC\u2019s proposed \u201cDo-Not-Track\u201d standard or other legislation or regulations similar to European Union Directive 2009/136/EC, commonly referred to as the \u201cCookie Directive,\u201d which directs EU member states to ensure that accessing information on an Internet user\u2019s computer, such as through a cookie, is allowed only if the Internet user has given his or her consent. The costs and other burdens of compliance with privacy and data security laws and regulations could negatively impact the use and adoption of our products and services and reduce overall demand for them. Additionally, concerns regarding data privacy may cause our customers, or their customers and potential customers, to resist providing the data necessary to allow us to deliver our products and services effectively. Even the perception that the privacy of personal information is not satisfactorily protected or does not meet regulatory requirements could inhibit sales of our products and services.\nThe CFPB has authority to issue new regulations and bring enforcement actions, including regulations prohibiting and enforcement actions redressing unfair, deceptive, and abusive acts and practices relating to consumer financial services against our lender clients. The FTC continues to have supervisory and enforcement authority over most franchised dealers, but the CFPB has supervisory and enforcement authority over independent and buy-here-pay-here dealers as well as financial institutions with assets in excess of $10 billion and other \u201clarger non-depository participants\u201d in the consumer financial services market. Our financing customers such as banks, finance companies and captives will be subject to the substantive regulations published by the CFPB (and franchised dealers will remain subject to parallel rules of the Federal Reserve Board) and many financing customers will be subject to the CFPB\u2019s supervisory authority on consumer finance issues if their assets exceed $10 billion or they are deemed by CFPB regulation to be a \u201clarger, non-depository participant\u201d for consumer financial services. The CFPB has proposed to extend its \u201clarger participant\u201d supervisory authority to include auto lenders that have in excess of 10,000 annual aggregate originations as \u201clarger participants\u201d in the market for consumer financial services.\nAs a service provider to supervised banks, the CFPB has supervisory authority over us. The CFPB may subject us to its supervision and examination authority as a \u201cservice provider.\u201d Similar to our customers, we may also be subject to changes in existing consumer financial protection law rulemaking by the CFPB. The Dodd-Frank Act also streamlined the administrative procedures for the FTC to promulgate unfair and deceptive practices regulations for the retail automotive industry. The FTC held a series of hearings in 2011 on auto financing practices. It is possible that the FTC will issue regulations or bring enforcement actions that may affect us and the products and services we offer to dealers.\nAfter conducting supervisory audits of large auto lenders, the CFPB issued Guidance in March 2013 with respect to possible Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) \u201cdisparate impact\u201d credit discrimination in indirect auto finance. A \u201cdisparate impact\u201d can occur when a facially-neutral practice (such as dealer markups of \u201cbuy rates\u201d or the selection of lenders to which dealers submit credit applications) results in statistically significant negative rates or terms for protected classes of persons under the ECOA. The CFPB recommended that lenders either implement a compliance program to monitor and assess the impact on ECOA protected classes of dealer rate markups or eliminate dealer rate markups and compensate dealers on a flat fee basis instead. In December 2013, the CFPB entered into a consent order with Ally Financial, Inc. and Ally Bank (Ally). The CFPB found that Ally\u2019s allowance of dealer discretion in marking up wholesale \u201cbuy rates\u201d for financing had a statistically significant disparate impact on rates paid by African-Americans, Hispanics, and Pacific Islanders and ordered Ally to pay $98 million in consumer compensation and penalties. The consent order with Ally did not forbid Ally from allowing dealers to markup its buy rates. The CFPB entered into similar consent decrees on a confidential supervisory basis with a number of other lenders in September 2014 requiring collective payments of $56 million to compensate approximately 190,000 consumers but not prohibiting dealer rate participation. Several additional lenders revealed in November 2014 that the CFPB had indicated it would bring enforcement proceedings against them if consent decrees could not be worked out. If the CFPB enters into consent decrees with other lenders on disparate impact claims that require a change in the way that dealers are compensated in connection with indirect auto finance, it could negatively impact the business of the affected lenders, and potentially the business of dealers and other lenders in the consumer indirect auto finance market. This impact on dealers and lenders could result in a reduction of revenue received by us.\nIn 2013, the CFPB issued subpoenas to U.S. auto lenders over the sale of service contracts and other credit protection products. These aftermarket products are a significant profit center for our dealer customers. Any regulation or restriction placed on the sale of these products could reduce dealer profitability which could have an adverse impact on the dollar amount that dealers spend on our products and services.\nIn addition to the laws and regulations mentioned above, our business is also directly or indirectly governed by laws and regulations in the U.S., Canada and foreign jurisdictions relating to issues such as telecommunications, anti-trust or competition, employment, vehicle registration, taxation and accessibility. We must also comply with anti-corruption laws such as the U.S Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials and private entities, such as the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act. The application of this framework of laws and regulations to our business is complex and, in many instances, is unclear or unsettled, which in turn increases our cost of doing business, may interfere with our ability to offer our products competitively in one or more jurisdictions and may expose us and our team members to potential fines, penalties or other enforcement actions. In some cases, our customers may seek to impose additional requirements on our business in efforts to comply with their interpretation of their own or our legal obligations. These requirements may differ significantly from our existing products or processes and may require engineering and other costly resources to accommodate. Our failure to comply, or to provide products that allow our customers to comply, with any of the foregoing laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, if a governmental authority or agency in the U.S., such as the federal CFPB or FTC, Canada or other foreign jurisdiction imposes additional legislative and/or regulatory requirements on us or our customers, or prohibits or limits our activities as currently conducted, we may be required to modify or terminate our products and services in a manner which could undermine our attractiveness or availability to dealers and/or lenders doing business in that jurisdiction.\nThe use of our electronic contracting product by lenders is governed by relatively new laws.\nIn the United States, the enforceability of electronic transactions is primarily governed by the E-SIGN Act, a federal law enacted in 2000 that largely preempts inconsistent state law, and the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, a uniform state law that was finalized by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in 1999 and has now been adopted by nearly every state. Case law has generally upheld the use of electronic signatures in commercial transactions and in consumer transactions where proper notice is provided and the consumer consents to transact business electronically. Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) 9-105 provides requirements to perfect security interests in electronic chattel paper, such as electronic contracts. These laws impact the degree to which the lenders in our network use our electronic contracting product. We believe that our electronic contracting product enables the perfection of a security interest in electronic chattel paper by meeting the \u201ctransfer of control\u201d and other requirements of UCC 9-105. Certain of our financial institution customers have received third-party legal opinions to that effect. However, this issue has not been challenged in any legal proceeding. If a court were to find that our electronic contracting product is not sufficient to perfect a security interest in electronic chattel paper, or if existing laws were to change, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Federal and state regulatory requirements imposed on our lender customers, such as the SEC\u2019s Regulation AB relating to servicers of asset backed securities, may also result in our incurring additional expenses to facilitate lender compliance regarding the use of our eContracting product.\nNew legislation or changes in existing legislation may adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to conduct, and our cost of conducting, business may be adversely affected by a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning aspects of the Internet, which are currently under consideration by federal, state, local and foreign governments, administrative agencies such as the FTC, the CFPB the FCC, and various courts. These proposals include, but are not limited to, the following matters: on-line content, user privacy, taxation, access charges, and so-called \u201cnet-neutrality\u201d liability of third-party activities and jurisdiction. Moreover, we do not know how existing laws relating to these or other issues will be applied to the Internet. The adoption of new laws or the application of existing laws could decrease the growth in the use of the Internet, which could in turn decrease the demand for our products and services, increase our cost of doing business or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. A federal appeals court overruled the FCC\u2019s \u201cnet neutrality\u201d regulation meaning that we may have to pay premium rates to providers for bandwidth and mobile service. Furthermore, government restrictions on Internet content or anti-\u201cnet neutrality\u201d legislation could slow the growth of Internet use and decrease acceptance of the Internet as a communications and commercial medium and thereby have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe utilize certain key technologies and data from, and integrate our network with, third parties and may be unable to replace those technologies if they become obsolete, unavailable or incompatible with our products or services.\nOur proprietary software is designed to work in conjunction with certain hardware, software and data from third-parties, particularly Microsoft in connection with our international DMS products, and also including eOriginal, IBM, Oracle, Salesforce.com, and SAP. Any significant interruption in the supply or maintenance of such third-party hardware, software and data could have a material adverse effect on our ability to offer our products unless and until we can replace the functionality provided by these products and services. In addition, we are dependent upon these third parties\u2019 ability to enhance their current products, develop new products on a timely and cost-effective basis and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes. There can be no assurance that we would be able to replace the functionality or data provided by the third-party vendors currently incorporated into our products or services in the event that such technologies or data becomes obsolete or incompatible with future versions of our products or services or is otherwise not adequately maintained or updated. Any delay in or inability to replace any such functionality could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, delays in the release of new and upgraded versions of third-party software products could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business operations may be disrupted if our Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and CRM system implementation is not successful.\nWe are in the process of converting our various business information systems to SAP ERP and Salesforce.com CRM. We have committed significant resources to this conversion and it is being phased in over multiple years. The conversion process is extremely complex, in part, because of the wide range of processes and the multiple legacy systems that must be integrated. We are using a controlled project plan that we believe will provide an adequate allocation of resources. However, such a plan, or a divergence from it, may result in cost overruns, project delays, or business interruptions. During the conversion process, we may be limited in our ability to integrate any business that we may want to acquire. Failure to properly or adequately address these issues could result in significant costs or impact our ability to perform necessary business operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to adequately protect, and we may incur significant costs in defending, our intellectual property and other proprietary rights.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. We rely upon a combination of trademark, trade secret, copyright, patent and unfair competition laws, as well as license agreements and other contractual provisions, to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. In addition, we attempt to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information by requiring certain of our team members and consultants to enter into confidentiality, non-competition and assignment of inventions agreements. To the extent that our intellectual property and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected, third parties might gain access to our proprietary information, develop and market products and services similar to ours, or use trademarks similar to ours. Existing U.S. federal and state intellectual property laws offer only limited protection. Moreover, the laws of Canada, and any other foreign countries in which we market our products and services, may afford little or no effective protection of our intellectual property. If we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of others, the proceedings could be burdensome and expensive, and we may not prevail. The failure to adequately protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, or manage costs associated with enforcing those rights, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe own the Internet domain names \u201cdealertrack.com\u201d, \u201cdealertrack.ca\u201d, \u201cdealer.com\u201d, \u201cincadea.com\u201d, and certain other domain names. The regulation of domain names in the United States and foreign countries may change. Regulatory bodies could establish additional top-level domains, appoint additional domain name registrars or modify the requirements for holding domain names, any or all of which may dilute the strength of our domain names. We may not acquire or maintain our domain names in all of the countries in which our websites may be accessed or for any or all of the top-level domain names that may be introduced. The relationship between regulations governing domain names and laws protecting intellectual property rights is unclear. Therefore, we may not be able to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that infringe or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other intellectual property rights.\nClaims that we or our technologies infringe upon the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of a third party may require us to incur significant costs, enter into royalty or licensing agreements or develop or license substitute technology.\nWe have in the past and may in the future be subject to claims that our technologies in our products and services infringe upon the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of a third party. In addition, the vendors providing us with technology that we use in our own technology could become subject to similar infringement claims. Although we believe that our products and services do not infringe any intellectual property or other proprietary rights, we cannot assure you that our products and services do not, or that they will not in the future, infringe intellectual property or other proprietary rights held by others. Any claims of infringement could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim, even if the claim is without merit, and could distract our management from our business. Moreover, any settlement or adverse judgment resulting from the claim could require us to pay substantial amounts, or obtain a license to continue to use the products and services that is the subject of the claim, and/or otherwise restrict or prohibit our use of the technology. There can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms from the third party asserting any particular claim, if at all, that we would be able to successfully develop alternative technology on a timely basis, if at all, or that we would be able to obtain a license from another provider of suitable alternative technology to permit us to continue offering, and our customers to continue using, the products and services. In addition, we generally provide in our customer agreements for certain products and services that we will indemnify our customers against third-party infringement claims relating to technology we provide to those customers, which could obligate us to pay damages if the products and services were found to be infringing. Infringement claims asserted against us, our vendors or our customers may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could be sued for contract or product liability claims, and such lawsuits may disrupt our business, divert management\u2019s attention or have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe provide limited warranties to subscribers of certain of our products and services. Additionally, general errors, defects or other performance problems in our products and services, including with respect to data we store, process and transmit in connection with our products and services, could result in financial or other damages to our customers or consumers; however, there can be no assurance that any limitations of liability set forth in our contracts would be enforceable or would otherwise protect us from liability for damages. We maintain general liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors and omissions in excess of the applicable deductible amount. There can be no assurance that this coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that the insurer will not deny coverage for any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, litigation, regardless of its outcome, could result in substantial cost to us and divert management\u2019s attention from our operations. Any contract liability claim or litigation against us could, therefore, have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, some of our products and services are business-critical for our dealer and lender customers and a failure or inability to meet a customer\u2019s expectations could seriously damage our reputation and affect our ability to retain existing business or attract new business.\nWe are dependent on our key management, direct sales force and technical personnel for continued success.\nOur company has grown significantly in size and scope in recent years, and our senior management remains concentrated in a small number of key team members. Our future success depends to a meaningful extent on our executive officers and other key team members, including members of our direct sales force and technology staff, such as our software developers and other senior technical personnel. Generally, our executive officers and team members can terminate their employment relationship at any time. The loss of any key team members or our inability to attract or retain other qualified personnel could materially harm our business and prospects.\nWe rely primarily on our direct sales force to sell subscription products and services to automotive dealers, OEMs and others. We may need to hire additional sales, customer service, integration and training personnel in the near-term and beyond if we are to achieve revenue growth in the future. Additionally, we utilize outsourcing vendors, both on-shore and offshore, to supplement our technical personnel and reduce our costs. The loss of the services of any individual or group of individuals or the failure to attract qualified and productive sales and service personnel and executive officers could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nCompetition for qualified personnel in the technology industry is intense and we compete for these personnel with other technology companies that have greater financial and other resources than we do. Our future success will depend in large part on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified personnel, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so. Any difficulty in hiring or retaining needed personnel, or increased costs related thereto could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have customers in over 90 countries, where we are subject to country-specific risks that could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFollowing our acquisition of incadea, we anticipate that approximately 5% of our overall revenue will be generated from our operations outside North America, and we expect revenues from those countries to continue to represent a significant part of our total revenues in the future. Business and operations in individual countries are subject to changes in local government regulations and policies, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, taxation, currency exchange controls and repatriation of earnings. Our results are also subject to the difficulties of coordinating our activities across the countries in which we are active. In addition, our operations in each country are vulnerable to changes in socio-economic conditions and monetary and fiscal policies, intellectual property protection disputes, the settlement of legal disputes through foreign legal systems, the collection of receivables through foreign legal systems, exposure to possible expropriation or other governmental actions, unsettled political conditions, possible terrorist attacks and pandemic disease. These and other factors relating to our international operations may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may experience foreign currency gains and losses.\nWe conduct a significant number of transactions and hold cash in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in the value of major foreign currencies, particularly the Canadian dollar and Euro relative to the U.S. dollar, can significantly affect our assets, liabilities revenues and operating results.\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile. There is substantial volatility in the domestic and international stock markets that could negatively impact our stock regardless of our actual operating performance.\nThe trading price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022 price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n\u2022 actual or anticipated changes in our earnings or fluctuations in our operating results or in the expectations of equity research analysts;\n\u2022 trends in the automotive and automotive finance industries;\n\u2022 catastrophic events;\n\u2022 fluctuations in the credit markets, including the pricing and availability of credit;\n\u2022 foreign currency fluctuations;\n\u2022 loss of one or more significant customers or strategic alliances;\n\u2022 announcements, significant acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures or capital commitments by us or our competitors;\n\u2022 legal or regulatory matters, including legal decisions affecting the indirect automotive finance industry or involving the enforceability or order of priority of security interests of electronic chattel paper affecting our electronic contracting product;\n\u2022 large block of trades of our common stock;\n\u2022 changes in general economic or market conditions;\n\u2022 additions or departures of key team members; and\n\u2022 the other factors described in these \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nThe stock market in general, the NASDAQ Stock Market, and the market for technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance. These forces reached unprecedented levels in the second half of 2008 through the first quarter of 2009, resulting in the bankruptcy or acquisition of, or government assistance to, several major domestic and international financial institutions and a material decline in economic conditions. In particular, the U.S. equity markets experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. These broad market and industry factors could materially and adversely affect the market price of our stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. Due to the potential volatility of our stock price, we may therefore be the target of securities litigation in the future. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources from our business.\nThe convertible note hedges and warrant transactions we entered into in connection with our senior convertible notes issuance may affect the trading price of our common stock.\nIn connection with our offering of our senior convertible notes due March 15, 2017, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with the initial purchasers of the notes or their respective affiliates (the hedge counterparties). The convertible note hedge transactions are expected to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock and/or offset potential cash payments in excess of the principal amount of the notes, as the case may be upon conversion of the notes. In the event that the hedge counterparties fail to deliver shares to us or potential cash payments as the case may be as required under the convertible note hedge documents, we would not receive the benefit of such transactions. Separately, we also entered into warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties. The warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect from the issuance of common stock pursuant to the warrants.\nIn connection with the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions, the hedge counterparties and/or their affiliates have or may enter into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock, and may enter into, or may unwind, various derivative transactions and/or purchase or sell our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to maturity of the notes (and are likely to do so during any conversion period related to any conversion of the notes). These activities could have the effect of increasing or preventing a decline in, or could have a negative effect on, the value of our common stock and could have the effect of increasing or preventing a decline in the value of our common stock during any cash settlement averaging period related to a conversion of the notes.\nIn addition, we intend to exercise options under the convertible note hedge transactions whenever notes are converted. In order to unwind its hedge position with respect to the options we exercise, the hedge counterparties and/or their affiliates may sell shares of our common stock or other securities in secondary market transactions or unwind various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock during the cash settlement averaging period for the converted notes. The effect, if any, of any of these transactions and activities on the trading price of our common stock or the notes will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time, but any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock and the value of the notes. The derivative transactions that the hedge counterparties and/or their affiliates expect to enter into to hedge these transactions may include cash-settled equity swaps referenced to our common stock. In certain circumstances, the hedge counterparties and/or their affiliates may have derivative positions that, when combined with the hedge counterparties\u2019 and their affiliates\u2019 ownership of our common stock, if any, would give them economic exposure to the return on a significant number of shares of our common stock.\nIn addition, the hedge counterparties to our cash convertible note hedge transactions are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we are subject to risks that these hedge counterparties default under these transactions. Our exposure to counterparty credit risk is not secured by any collateral. If one or more of the hedge counterparties to one or more of our convertible note hedge transactions becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under those transactions. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in our stock price and in volatility of our stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of our counterparties.\nThe conditional conversion features of the convertible notes, if satisfied, may adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and liquidity.\nIn the event the conditional conversion features of the convertible notes are satisfied, holders of convertible notes will be entitled to convert the convertible notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their convertible notes, we may, if we so elect or are deemed to have so elected, be required to settle all or a portion of the conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their convertible notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nSome provisions in our certificate of incorporation, by-laws and of Delaware law and our debt may deter, prevent or delay third parties from acquiring us.\nOur fifth amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws and Delaware law contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022 our board of directors is classified into three classes, each of which serves for a staggered three-year term;\n\u2022 only our board of directors may call special meetings of our stockholders;\n\u2022 we have authorized undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval;\n\u2022 our stockholders have only limited rights to amend our by-laws;\n\u2022 our stockholders cannot act by written consent; and\n\u2022 we require advance notice for stockholder proposals and director nominations.\nThese anti-takeover defenses could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions you desire. In addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by our stockholders to replace current members of our management team.\nIn addition, we have not opted out of the protections afforded by Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law which provides that a stockholder who becomes a beneficial owner of 15% or more of a Delaware corporation\u2019s voting stock (an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d) but less than 85% of such capital stock may not engage in certain business combinations with such corporation for a three-year period following the date that such stockholder became an interested stockholder unless, prior to such date, the board of directors of such corporation approves either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder or the business combination is approved by the board of directors and by the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the corporation\u2019s voting stock that is not owned by the interested stockholder.\nWe believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal, and are not intended to make our company immune from takeovers. However, Section 203 applies even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our company that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests.\nCertain provisions of our senior convertible notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. Upon the occurrence of certain transactions constituting a fundamental change, holders of the notes will have the right, at their option, to require us to repurchase all of their notes or any portion of the principal amount of such notes in integral multiples of $1,000. We also may be required to issue additional shares upon conversion in the event of certain fundamental changes.\nThe fundamental change purchase rights, which will allow holders of the notes to require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, as defined in the indenture governing the notes, and the provisions requiring an increase to the conversion rate for conversions in connection with make-whole fundamental changes, as set forth in the indenture, may in certain circumstances delay or prevent a takeover of us that may be beneficial to investors. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain extraordinary events, the convertible note hedge transactions would be exercised upon the conversion of notes, and the warrant transactions may be terminated. It is possible that the proceeds we receive upon the exercise of the convertible note hedge transactions would be significantly lower than the amounts we would be required to pay upon termination of the warrant transactions. Such differences may result in the acquisition of us being on terms less favorable to our stockholders than it would otherwise be.", "PERMNO": 91032, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "TRAK"}
