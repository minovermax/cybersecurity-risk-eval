{"cik": "1633931", "company": "TopBuild Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThere are a number of risks and uncertainties that could affect our business and cause our actual results to differ from past performance or expected results. We consider the following risks and uncertainties to be those material to our business. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer, and the trading price of our common stock could decline. We urge investors to consider carefully the risk factors described below in evaluating the information contained in this Annual Report.\nOur business relies on residential new construction activity, and to a lesser extent on residential repair/remodel and commercial construction activity, all of which are cyclical.\nDemand for our services is cyclical and highly sensitive to general macroeconomic and local economic conditions over which we have no control. Macroeconomic and local economic conditions, including consumer confidence levels, fluctuations in home prices, unemployment and underemployment levels, student loan debt, household formation rates, mortgage tax deduction limits, the age and volume of the housing stock, the availability of home equity loans and mortgages and the interest rates for such loans, and other factors, affect consumers\u2019 discretionary spending on both residential new construction projects and residential repair/remodel activity. The commercial construction market is affected by macroeconomic and local economic factors such as interest rates, credit availability for commercial construction projects, material costs, employment rates, office vacancy rates, and office absorption rates. Changes or uncertainty regarding these and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations and our financial position.\nWe may not be successful in identifying and making acquisitions. In addition, acquisition integrations, such as USI, involve risks that could negatively affect our operating results, cash flows, and liquidity.\nWe have made, and in the future may continue to make, strategic acquisitions as part of our growth strategy. We may be unable to make accretive acquisitions or realize expected benefits of any acquisitions for any of the following reasons:\n\u00b7\nfailure to identify attractive targets in the marketplace;\n\u00b7\nincreased competition for attractive targets;\n\u00b7\nincorrect assumptions regarding the future results of acquired operations or assets, expected cost reductions, or other synergies expected to be realized as a result of acquiring operations or assets;\n\u00b7\nfailure to obtain acceptable financing; or\n\u00b7\nrestrictions in our debt agreements.\nOur ability to successfully implement our business plan and achieve targeted financial results is dependent on our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses. The process of integrating acquired businesses, may expose us to operational challenges and risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7\nthe ability to profitably manage acquired businesses or successfully integrate the acquired business\u2019 operations, financial reporting, and accounting control systems into our business;\n\u00b7\nthe expense of integrating acquired businesses;\n\u00b7\nincreased indebtedness;\n\u00b7\nthe loss of suppliers, customers or other significant business partners of acquired businesses;\n\u00b7\nthe ability to fund cash flow shortages that may occur if anticipated revenue is not realized or is delayed, whether by general economic or market conditions, or unforeseen internal difficulties;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u00b7\nthe availability of funding sufficient to meet increased capital needs;\n\u00b7\npotential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets;\n\u00b7\nrisks associated with the internal controls and accounting policies of acquired businesses;\n\u00b7\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention due to the increase in the size of our business;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in the assimilation of different corporate cultures and business practices;\n\u00b7\nthe ability to retain vital employees or hire qualified personnel required for expanded operations;\n\u00b7\nfailure to identify all known and contingent liabilities during due diligence investigations; and\n\u00b7\nthe indemnification granted to us by sellers of acquired companies may not be sufficient.\nFailure to successfully integrate USI, and any other acquired businesses, may result in reduced levels of revenue, earnings, or operating efficiency than might have been achieved if we had not acquired such businesses. In addition, our acquisition of USI resulted, and any future acquisitions could result, in the incurrence of additional debt and related interest expense, contingent liabilities, and amortization expenses related to intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results, and cash flow.\nWe may not be able to achieve the benefits that we expect to realize as a result of the acquisition of USI or any future acquisitions. Failure to achieve such benefits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to realize anticipated cost savings, revenue enhancements, or other synergies from the USI acquisition or any future acquisitions, either in the amount or within the time frame that we expect. In addition, the costs of achieving these benefits may be higher than, and the timing may differ from, what we expect. Our ability to realize anticipated cost savings, synergies, and revenue enhancements may be affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7\nthe use of more cash or other financial resources on integration and implementation activities than we expect;\n\u00b7\nunanticipated increases in expenses unrelated to the USI acquisition, or any future acquisition, which may offset the expected cost savings and other synergies from the USI acquisition, or any future acquisition;\n\u00b7\nour ability to eliminate duplicative back office overhead and redundant selling, general, and administrative functions; and\n\u00b7\nour ability to avoid labor disruptions in connection with the integration of USI or any future acquisition, particularly in connection with any headcount reduction.\nSpecifically, while we expect the USI acquisition or any future acquisition to create opportunities to reduce our combined operating costs, these cost savings reflect estimates and assumptions made by our management, and it is possible that our actual results will not reflect these estimates and assumptions within our anticipated timeframe or at all.\nIf we fail to realize anticipated cost savings, synergies, or revenue enhancements, our financial results may be adversely affected, and we may not generate the cash flow from operations that we anticipate.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe are dependent on third-party suppliers and manufacturers to provide us with an adequate supply of quality products, and the loss of a large supplier or manufacturer could negatively affect our operating results.\nFailure by our suppliers to provide us with an adequate supply of quality products on commercially reasonable terms, or to comply with applicable legal requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results. While we believe that we have generally positive relationships with our suppliers, the fiberglass insulation industry has encountered both shortages and periods of significant oversupply during past housing market cycles, leading to volatility in prices and allocations of supply, affecting our results. While we do not believe we depend on any sole or limited source of supply, we do source the majority of our building products, primarily insulation, from a limited number of large suppliers. The loss of a large supplier, or a substantial decrease in the availability of products or components from our suppliers, could disrupt our business and adversely affect our operating results.\nThe long-term performance of our businesses relies on our ability to attract, develop, and retain talented personnel, including sales representatives, branch managers, installers, and truck drivers, while controlling our labor costs.\nWe are highly dependent on the skills and experience of our senior management team and other skilled and experienced personnel. The failure to attract and retain key employees could negatively affect our competitive position and operating results.\nOur business results also depend upon our branch managers and sales personnel, including those of businesses acquired. Our ability to control labor costs and attract qualified labor is subject to numerous external factors including prevailing wage rates, labor shortages, the impact of legislation or regulations governing wages and hours, labor relations, immigration, healthcare benefits, and other insurance costs. In addition, we compete with other companies to recruit and retain qualified installers and truck drivers in a tight labor market, and we invest significant resources in training and motivating them to maintain a high level of job satisfaction. These positions generally have high turnover rates, which can lead to increased training and retention costs.\nBecause we operate our business through highly dispersed locations across the U.S., our operations may be materially adversely affected by inconsistent local practices and the operating results of individual branches and distribution centers may vary.\nWe operate our business through a network of highly dispersed locations throughout the United States, supported by executives and services at our Branch Support Center in Daytona Beach, Florida, with local branch management retaining responsibility for day-to-day operations and adherence to applicable local laws. Our operating structure can make it difficult for us to coordinate procedures across our operations. In addition, our branches and distribution facilities may require significant oversight and coordination from headquarters to support their growth. Inconsistent implementation of corporate strategy and policies at the local or regional level could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur profit margins could decrease due to changes in the costs of the products we install and/or distribute.\nThe principal building products that we install and distribute have been subject to price changes in the past, some of which have been significant. Our results of operations for individual quarters can be, and have been, hurt by a delay between the time building product cost increases are implemented and the time we are able to increase prices for our installation or distribution services, if at all. Our supplier purchase prices may depend on our purchasing volume or other arrangements with any given supplier. While we have been able to achieve cost savings through volume purchasing or other arrangements with suppliers in the past, we may not be able to consistently continue to receive advantageous pricing for the products we distribute and install. If we are unable to maintain pricing consistent with prior periods, our costs could increase and our margins may be adversely affected.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe face significant competition, and increased competitive pressure may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe market for the distribution and installation of building products is highly fragmented and competitive, and barriers to entry are relatively low. Our installation competitors include national contractors, regional contractors, and local contractors, and we face many or all of these competitors for each project on which we bid. Our insulation distribution competitors include specialty insulation distributors (one multi-regional, several regional, and numerous local). In some instances, our insulation distribution business sells products to companies that may compete directly with our installation service business. We also compete with broad line building products distributors, big box retailers, and insulation manufacturers. In addition to price, we believe that competition in our industry is based largely on customer service and the quality and timeliness of installation services and distribution product deliveries in each local market.\nIn the event that increased demand leads to higher prices for the products we sell and install, we may have limited ability to pass on price increases in a timely manner or at all due to the fragmented and competitive nature of our industry.\nOur business is seasonal and is susceptible to adverse weather conditions and natural disasters. We also may be adversely affected by any natural or man-made disruptions to our facilities.\nWe normally experience stronger sales during the third and fourth calendar quarters, corresponding with the peak season for residential new construction and residential repair/remodel activity. Sales during the winter weather months are seasonally slower due to the lower construction activity. Historically, the installation of insulation lags housing starts by several months.\nIn addition, to the extent that hurricanes, severe storms, earthquakes, droughts, floods, fires, other natural disasters, or similar events occur in the geographic areas in which we operate, our business may be adversely affected.\nAny widespread disruption to our facilities resulting from a natural disaster, an act of terrorism, or any other cause could damage a significant portion of our inventory, and could materially impair our ability to provide installation and/or distribution services for our customers.\nClaims and litigation could be costly.\nWe are, from time to time, involved in various claims, litigation matters, and regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business and which could have a material adverse effect on us. These matters may include contract disputes, automobile liability and other personal injury claims, warranty disputes, environmental claims or proceedings, other tort claims, employment and tax matters, the quality of products sourced from our suppliers, and other proceedings and litigation, including class actions. In addition, we are exposed to potential claims by our employees or others based on job related hazards.\nOur builder and contractor customers are subject to product liability, casualty, negligence, construction defect, breach of contract, warranty and other claims in the ordinary course of their business. We rely on manufacturers and other suppliers to provide us with most of the products we install. Because we do not have direct control over the quality of such products manufactured or supplied by such third-party suppliers, we are exposed to risks relating to the quality of such products. In addition, we are exposed to potential claims arising from the conduct of our employees, homebuilders and other subcontractors, for which we may be liable contractually or otherwise. Our contractual arrangements with our builder and contractor customers may include our agreement to defend and indemnify them against various liabilities.\nProduct liability, workmanship warranty, casualty, negligence, construction defect, breach of contract and other claims and legal proceedings can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time, regardless of fault or the ultimate outcome. In addition, lawsuits relating to construction defects typically have statutes of limitations that can run as long as ten years. Claims of this nature could also have a negative impact on customer confidence in us and our services.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nAlthough we intend to defend all claims and litigation matters vigorously, given the inherently unpredictable nature of claims and litigation, we cannot predict with certainty the outcome or effect of any claim or litigation matter.\nWe expect to maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks of loss resulting from claims and litigation. We may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. The levels of insurance we maintain may not be adequate to fully cover any and all losses or liabilities. If any significant accident, judgment, claim, or other event is not fully insured or indemnified against, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to identify new products or new product lines and integrate them into our distribution network, which may impact our ability to compete. Our expansion into new markets may present competitive, distribution, and regulatory challenges that differ from current ones.\nOur business depends in part on our ability to identify future products and product lines that complement existing products and product lines and that respond to our customers\u2019 needs.\nWe may not be able to compete effectively unless our product selection keeps up with trends in the markets in which we compete or trends in new products, which could cause us to lose market share. In addition, our ability to integrate new products and product lines into our distribution network could affect our ability to compete.\nWe are subject to competitive pricing pressure from our customers.\nResidential homebuilders historically have exerted significant pressure on their outside suppliers to keep prices low in the highly fragmented building products supply and services industry. In addition, consolidation among homebuilders, and changes in homebuilders\u2019 purchasing policies or payment practices could result in additional pricing pressure.\nThe development of alternatives to distributors in the supply chain could cause a decrease in our sales and operating results and limit our ability to grow our business.\nOur distribution customers could begin purchasing more of their products directly from manufacturers, which would result in decreases in our net sales and earnings. Our suppliers could invest in infrastructure to expand their own local sales force and sell more products directly to our distribution customers, which also would negatively impact our business.\nIf we are required to take significant non-cash charges, our financial resources could be reduced and our financial flexibility may be negatively affected.\nWe have significant goodwill and other intangible assets related to business combinations on our balance sheet. The valuation of these assets is largely dependent upon the expectations for future performance of our businesses. Expectations about the growth of residential new construction, commercial construction, and residential repair/remodel activity may impact whether we are required to recognize non-cash, pre-tax impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets or other long-lived assets. If the value of our goodwill, other intangible assets, or long-lived assets is further impaired, our earnings and stockholders\u2019 equity would be adversely affected and may impact our ability to raise capital in the future.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nCompliance with government regulation and industry standards could impact our operating results.\nWe are subject to federal, state, and local government regulations, particularly those pertaining to health and safety, including protection of employees and consumers; employment laws, including immigration and wage and hour regulations; contractor licensing; and environmental issues. In addition to complying with current requirements, even more stringent requirements could be imposed in the future. Compliance with these regulations and industry standards is costly and may require us to alter our installation and distribution processes, product sourcing, or business practices, and makes recruiting and retaining labor in a tight labor market more challenging. Compliance with these regulations and industry standards could also divert our attention and resources to compliance activities, and could cause us to incur higher costs. Further, if we do not effectively and timely comply with such regulations and industry standards, our results of operations could be negatively affected and we could become subject to substantial penalties or other legal liability.\nChanges in employment laws may adversely affect our business.\nVarious federal and state labor laws govern the relationship with our employees and impact operating costs. These laws include:\n\u00b7\nemployee classification as exempt or non-exempt for overtime and other purposes;\n\u00b7\nworkers\u2019 compensation rates;\n\u00b7\nimmigration status;\n\u00b7\nmandatory health benefits;\n\u00b7\ntax reporting; and\n\u00b7\nother wage and benefit requirements.\nWe have a significant exposure to changes in laws governing our relationships with our employees, including wage and hour laws and regulations, fair labor standards, minimum wage requirements, overtime pay, unemployment tax rates, workers\u2019 compensation rates, citizenship requirements and payroll taxes, which changes would have a direct impact on our operating costs. Significant additional government-imposed increases in the preceding areas could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, various states in which we operate are considering or have already adopted new immigration laws or enforcement programs, and the U.S. Congress and Department of Homeland Security from time to time consider and implement changes to federal immigration laws, regulations or enforcement programs. These changes may increase our compliance and oversight obligations, which could subject us to additional costs and make our hiring process more cumbersome, or reduce the availability of potential employees. Although we verify the employment eligibility status of all our employees, including through participation in the \u201cE-Verify\u201d program where required, some of our employees may, without our knowledge, be unauthorized workers. Use of the \u201cE-Verify\u201d program does not guarantee that we will properly identify all applicants who are ineligible for employment. Unauthorized workers are subject to deportation and may subject us to fines or penalties and, if any of our workers are found to be unauthorized, we could experience adverse publicity that negatively impacts our brand and may make it more difficult to hire and retain qualified employees, which could disrupt our operations. We could also become subject to fines, penalties and other costs related to claims that we did not fully comply with all recordkeeping obligations of federal and state immigration laws. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nUnion organizing activity and work stoppages could delay or reduce availability of products that we install and increase our costs.\nApproximately 830 of our employees are currently covered by collective bargaining or other similar labor agreements that expire on various dates from 2019 through 2027. Any inability by us to negotiate collective bargaining arrangements could cause strikes or other work stoppages, and new contracts could result in increased operating costs. If any such strikes or other work stoppages occur, or if other employees become represented by a union, we could experience a disruption of our operations and higher labor costs. Further, if a significant number of additional employees were to unionize, including in the wake of any future legislation that makes it easier for employees to unionize, these risks would increase. In addition, certain of our suppliers have unionized work forces, and certain of the products we install and/or distribute are transported by unionized truckers. Strikes, work stoppages, or slowdowns could result in slowdowns or closures of facilities where the products that we install and/or distribute are manufactured, or could affect the ability of our suppliers to deliver such products to us. Any interruption in the production or delivery of these products could delay or reduce availability of these products and increase our costs.\nIf we encounter difficulties with our information technology systems, we could experience problems with customer service, inventory, collections, and cost control.\nOur operations are dependent upon our information technology systems to manage customer orders on a timely basis, to coordinate our installation and distribution activities across locations, and to manage invoicing. If we experience problems with our information technology systems, we could experience, among other things, delays in receiving customer orders, placing orders with suppliers, and scheduling production, installation services, or shipments.\nA substantial disruption in our information technology systems could have an adverse impact on revenue, harm our reputation, and cause us to incur legal liability and costs, which could be significant, to address and remediate such events and related security concerns.\nIn addition, we could be adversely affected if any of our significant customers or suppliers experienced any similar events that disrupted their respective business operations or damaged their reputations.\nIn the event of a cybersecurity incident, we could experience operational interruptions, incur substantial additional costs, become subject to legal or regulatory proceedings or suffer damage to our reputation.\nIn addition to the disruptions that may occur from interruptions in our information technology systems, cybersecurity threats and sophisticated and targeted cyberattacks pose a risk to our information technology systems. We have established security policies, processes and defenses designed to help identify and protect against intentional and unintentional misappropriation or corruption of our information technology systems and disruption of our operations. Despite these efforts, our information technology systems may be damaged, disrupted or shut down due to attacks by unauthorized access, malicious software, computer viruses, undetected intrusion, hardware failures or other events, and in these circumstances our disaster recovery plans may be ineffective or inadequate. These breaches or intrusions could lead to business interruption, exposure of proprietary or confidential information, data corruption, damage to our reputation, exposure to legal and regulatory proceedings and other costs. Such events could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, we could be adversely affected if any of our significant customers or suppliers experiences any similar events that disrupt their business operations or damage their reputation.\nWe maintain monitoring practices and protections of our information technology to reduce these risks and test our systems on an ongoing basis for potential threats. We carry cybersecurity insurance to help mitigate the financial exposure and related notification procedures in the event of intentional intrusion. There can be no assurance, however, that our efforts will prevent the risk of a security breach of our databases or systems that could adversely affect our business.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOur business relies significantly on the expertise of our employees, and we generally do not have intellectual property that is protected by patents.\nOur business is significantly dependent upon our expertise in installation and distribution logistics, including significant expertise in the application of building science through our Environments for Living\u00ae program. We rely on a combination of trade secrets and contractual confidentiality provisions and, to a much lesser extent, copyrights and trademarks, to protect our proprietary rights. Accordingly, our intellectual property is more vulnerable than it would be if it were protected primarily by patents. We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our proprietary rights, and in the event a misappropriation or breach of our proprietary rights occurs, our competitive position in the market may be harmed. In addition, competitors may develop competing technologies and expertise that renders our expertise obsolete or less valuable.\nChanges in building codes and consumer preferences could affect our ability to market our service offerings and our profitability. Moreover, if we do not respond to evolving customer preferences or changes in building standards, or if we do not maintain or expand our leadership in building science, our business, results of operation, financial condition, and cash flow would be adversely affected.\nEach of our lines of business is impacted by local and state building codes and consumer preferences, including a growing focus on energy efficiency. Our competitive advantage is due, in part, to our ability to respond to changes in consumer preferences and building codes. However, if our installation and distribution services do not adequately or quickly adapt to changing preferences and building standards, we may lose market share to competitors, which would adversely affect our business, results of operation, financial condition, and cash flows. Further, our growth prospects could be harmed if consumer preferences and building standards evolve more slowly than we anticipate towards energy-efficient service offerings, which are more profitable than minimum code service offerings.\nWe may have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including industry and market conditions, our ability to successfully complete future business combinations and the expansion of our existing operations. We anticipate that we may need to raise additional funds in order to grow our business and implement our business strategy. Economic and credit market conditions, the performance of the construction industry, and our financial performance, as well as other factors may constrain our financing abilities. Our ability to secure additional financing and to satisfy our financial obligations will depend upon our future operating performance; the availability of credit; economic conditions; and financial, business, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Any financing, if available, may be on terms that are not favorable to us and will be subject to changes in interest rates and the capital markets environment. If we cannot obtain adequate capital, we may not be able to fully implement our business strategy and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur indebtedness and restrictions in our existing credit facility, Senior Notes or any other indebtedness we may incur in the future, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, ability to make distributions to shareholders, and the value of our common stock.\nOur indebtedness could have significant consequences on our future operations, including:\n\u00b7\nmaking it more difficult for us to meet our payment and other obligations;\n\u00b7\nreducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or strategic investments and other general corporate requirements, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes;\n\u00b7\nsubjecting us to increased interest expense related to our indebtedness with variable interest rates, including borrowings under our credit facility;\n\u00b7\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and the general economy; and\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u00b7\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged.\nAny of the above-listed factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital, and some of these activities may be on terms that are unfavorable or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations.\nCertain of our variable rate indebtedness uses LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the rate of interest. LIBOR is the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms and other pressures may cause LIBOR to be replaced with a new benchmark or to perform differently than in the past. The consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted, but could include an increase in the cost of our variable rate indebtedness.\nOur existing term loan, revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our Senior Notes limit, and any future credit facility or other indebtedness we enter into may limit, our ability to, among other things:\n\u00b7\nIncur or guarantee additional debt;\n\u00b7\nMake distributions or dividends on, or redeem or repurchase shares of our common stock;\n\u00b7\nMake certain investments, acquisitions, or other restricted payments;\n\u00b7\nIncur certain liens or permit them to exist;\n\u00b7\nAcquire, merge, or consolidate with another company; and\n\u00b7\nTransfer, sell, or otherwise dispose of substantially all of our assets.\nOur revolving credit facility contains, and any future credit facility or other debt instrument we may enter into will also likely contain, covenants requiring us to maintain certain financial ratios and meet certain tests, such as a fixed charge coverage ratio, a leverage ratio, and a minimum test. Our ability to comply with those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to comply with those ratios and tests when required to do so under the applicable debt instruments.\nAdverse credit ratings could increase our costs of borrowing money and limit our access to capital markets and commercial credit.\nMoody\u2019s Investor Service and Standard & Poor\u2019s routinely evaluate our credit ratings related to our Senior Notes. If these rating agencies downgrade any of our current credit ratings, our borrowing costs could increase and our access to the capital and commercial credit markets could be adversely affected.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIn connection with the Separation, Masco indemnified us for certain liabilities and we indemnified Masco for certain liabilities. If we are required to act under these indemnities to Masco, we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations, which could adversely affect our financial results. Moreover, the Masco indemnity may not be sufficient to compensate us for the full amount of liabilities for which it may be liable, and Masco may not be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations to us in the future.\nIndemnities that we may be required to provide Masco are not subject to any cap, may be significant, and could negatively affect our business, particularly indemnities relating to our actions that could affect the tax-free nature of the Separation. Third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that Masco has agreed to retain, and under certain circumstances, we may be subject to continuing contingent liabilities of Masco following the Separation, such as certain shareholder litigation claims. Further, Masco may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations or such indemnity obligations may not be sufficient to cover our liabilities. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Masco any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition.\nCompliance with and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our performance.\nWe are subject to extensive tax liabilities imposed by multiple jurisdictions including income taxes; indirect taxes which include excise and duty, sales and use, and gross receipts taxes; payroll taxes; franchise taxes; withholding taxes; and ad valorem taxes. New tax laws and regulations, and changes in existing tax laws and regulations, are continuously being enacted or proposed which could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future. Many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority. Subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may subject us to interest and penalties.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially, and the value of your investment may decline.\nThe market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u00b7\nFluctuations in our quarterly or annual earnings results, or those of other companies in our industry\n\u00b7\nFailures of our operating results to meet our published guidance, the estimates of securities analysts or the expectations of our stockholders, or changes by securities analysts in their estimates of our future earnings\n\u00b7\nAnnouncements by us or our customers, suppliers, or competitors\n\u00b7\nChanges in laws or regulations which adversely affect our industry or us\n\u00b7\nChanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations, or principles\n\u00b7\nGeneral economic, industry, and stock market conditions\n\u00b7\nFuture sales of our common stock by our stockholders\n\u00b7\nFuture issuances of our common stock by us\n\u00b7\nOther factors described in these \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and certain provisions of Delaware law, could delay or prevent a change in control.\nThe existence of some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law could discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control that a stockholder may consider favorable. These include provisions:\n\u00b7\nAuthorizing a large number of shares of stock that are not yet issued, which could have the effect of preventing or delaying a change in control if our board of directors issued shares to persons that did not support such change in control, or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control\n\u00b7\nProhibiting stockholders from calling special meetings of stockholders or taking action by written consent\n\u00b7\nEstablishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at the annual stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by our board of directors, including discouraging takeover attempts that could have resulted in a premium over the market price for shares of our common stock.\nThese provisions apply even if a takeover offer is considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in our and our stockholders\u2019 best interests.\nOur bylaws designate a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a preferred judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees.\nOur bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer, or other employee to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation (including any certificate of designations for any class or series of our preferred stock), or our bylaws, in each case, as amended from time to time, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, shall be a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware, in all cases subject to the court\u2019s having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock is deemed to have received notice of, and consented to, the foregoing provision. This forum selection provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable or cost-effective for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and employees.", "PERMNO": 15397, "SIC": 1700, "TIC": "BLD"}
