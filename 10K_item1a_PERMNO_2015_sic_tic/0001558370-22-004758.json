{"cik": "1261249", "company": "AGILE THERAPEUTICS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other public filings in evaluating our business. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. The risks described below are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently view to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In these circumstances, the market price of our common stock would likely decline.\nRisks Related to the Commercialization of Twirla\nWe are significantly dependent on the commercial success of Twirla, our only approved product. If we are unable to successfully commercialize Twirla, our business, financial condition, revenue, results of operations, and prospects and value of our common stock will be materially adversely affected.\nTwirla is the first and only product that we are commercializing. The rest of our pipeline of potential product candidates are in earlier stages of clinical development and will require additional product development, clinical studies and funding in order to advance towards commercialization, which could take considerable time. Our ability to generate revenues and become profitable will depend in large part on the commercial success of Twirla.\nThe commercial success of Twirla will depend upon (1) the contraceptive market landscape and (2) acceptance and uptake of Twirla by prescribers, patients and third-party payors. Risks related to the contraceptive market landscape include:\n\u25cf The prescription contraceptive market could experience a decrease in growth or negative growth if fewer women choose to use hormonal contraception;\n\u25cf Price pressures and decisions to deny reimbursement coverage from third party payors, including managed care organizations and government-sponsored health systems, could limit our revenue;\n\u25cf The proportion of the contraceptive market comprised of generic products could continue to increase, making the commercialization of a branded contraceptive difficult and expensive and increasing costs associated with marketing and market access;\n\u25cf The perceived safety of hormonal contraceptives could be negatively affected by media reports of adverse effects and advertisements for mass tort lawsuits due to adverse effects;\n\u25cf Competition in the contraceptive market from existing branded or generic contraceptives, or as a result of the introduction of new contraceptives, including the potential of a new generic or branded competitive contraceptive patch;\n\u25cf Healthcare reform activities, including, without limitation, the repeal, reform or replacement of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 or, collectively, the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, and its effects on pharmaceutical coverage, reimbursement and pricing, could limit our revenue.\nSecondly, if Twirla does not gain an adequate level of acceptance among prescribers, patients and third party payors, we may not generate significant product revenues or become profitable. Market acceptance of Twirla by prescribers, patients and third-party payors and our resulting ability to commercialize Twirla will depend on a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u25cf Availability of adequate coverage or reimbursement of Twirla by third parties, such as insurance companies and other payors, and by government healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and state health insurance exchanges;\n\u25cf Efficacy, safety and other potential advantages of Twirla in relation to alternative treatments;\n\u25cf Relative convenience, acceptability of use, and ease of administration of Twirla;\n\u25cf Prevalence and severity of adverse events associated with Twirla;\n\u25cf Willingness of prescribers to prescribe a contraceptive patch based on the labeling and prior safety experience with the generic contraceptive patch already on the market. For more information regarding the prior safety and market experience with the prior patch see Part 1, Item 1, Contraceptive Patch Market Experience;\n\u25cf Cost of Twirla in relation to alternative treatments, including generic products;\n\u25cf Access to the prescriber universe, particularly obstetrics and gynecology physicians, and pharmacists (in states where they are permitted to prescribe) could be limited, decreasing our ability to promote Twirla efficiently;\n\u25cf Our reliance on data from external, unverifiable sources of data and market research to estimate the size of the CHC market, the potential market opportunity for Twirla, and to identify healthcare providers most likely to prescribe Twirla;\n\u25cf Extent and strength of our third-party manufacturer and supplier support and ability to meet our market demand;\n\u25cf Extent and strength of our marketing and distribution support; and\n\u25cf Limitations, warnings, or contraindications contained in Twirla\u2019s FDA approved labeling, including safety warnings and precautions, contraindications and limitations on the use of Twirla for women based on BMI.\nFor example, prescribers and patients may not be immediately receptive to a transdermal contraceptive system, as opposed to a pill or any other method, and may be slow to adopt it as an accepted treatment for the prevention of pregnancy. We also may face unexpected competition. Upon approval by the FDA, we received three years of FDA marketing exclusivity for Twirla under the FDCA. This three-year marketing exclusivity, however, does not protect Twirla from all competition. It also would only protect against the approval of a product that contains the same conditions of approval as Twirla and would not prohibit the approval of a full NDA. Competition that Twirla and our potential product candidates may face from generic or similar versions of the same or similar products could materially and adversely impact our future revenue, profitability and cash flows and substantially limit our ability to obtain a return on the investments we have made in Twirla or our potential product candidates.\nIf Twirla does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by prescribers, third-party payors and patients, we may not generate sufficient revenue, we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability, and the value of our common stock may be adversely impacted. Our efforts to educate prescribers, patients and third-party payors on the benefits of Twirla may require significant resources and may never be successful. Even if we are able to demonstrate and maintain a competitive advantage over our competitors and become profitable, if the market for hormonal contraceptives fails to achieve expected future growth or decreases, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue or sustain profitability. Our ability to generate sufficient revenue from Twirla will also be dependent on our ability to support the commercial demand for Twirla and we cannot assure that we and Corium will be able to manufacture sufficient quantities of Twirla in order to meet commercial demand.\nIt will be difficult for us to profitably sell Twirla if third-party coverage and reimbursement for such product is limited, and reimbursement and healthcare containment initiatives and treatment guidelines may constrain our future revenues.\nMarket acceptance and sales of Twirla will depend on coverage and reimbursement policies and may be affected by future healthcare reform measures. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels for approved medications. A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry is cost containment. Government authorities and these third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications, including branded innovator products. We cannot be sure that coverage or reimbursement will be available for Twirla and, if coverage is available, we cannot be sure of the level of reimbursement. Even when a payor determines that a product is eligible for reimbursement, the payor may set a reimbursement rate that is too low to support a profitable sales price for the product. Subsequent approvals of competitive products could result in a detrimental\nchange to the reimbursement of our products. Reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, Twirla. Numerous generic products may be available at lower prices than branded therapy products, such as Twirla, which may also reduce the likelihood and level of reimbursement for Twirla.\nIf we are unable to develop effective marketing and sales capabilities for Twirla or maintain our agreements with third parties to market and sell Twirla, we may be unable to generate product revenues.\nAt present, we have a limited number of marketing personnel and rely on a contract sales organization in the United States. In April 2020, we entered into an agreement with inVentiv Commercial Services, a Syneos Health group company, to provide a contract sales force and related sales services for Twirla, and they have been detailing Twirla to health care providers through both live and virtual meetings.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will be successful in marketing Twirla in the United States. We may not be able to continue to develop our own marketing capabilities or a contract sales force in a cost-effective manner or realize a positive return on this investment. In addition, we will have to compete with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to recruit, hire, train and retain sales and marketing personnel. Factors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize Twirla in the United States include:\n\u25cf Our or our contractor\u2019s inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u25cf The ability of sales personnel to obtain access to or persuade adequate numbers of prescribers to prescribe Twirla, which has been and may continue to be influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u25cf The lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines;\n\u25cf The costs associated with training sales and marketing personnel on legal and regulatory compliance matters and monitoring their actions;\n\u25cf Liability for sales or marketing personnel who fail to comply with the applicable legal and regulatory requirements; and\n\u25cf Unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization or partnering with our contract sales organization, including difficulty managing the growth that both of these activities would require.\nIf we are not successful in retaining sales and marketing personnel or in continuing to build and maintain a sales and marketing infrastructure, or if we do not successfully enter into appropriate collaboration arrangements, we could have difficulty commercializing Twirla, which could adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, and value of our common stock.\nTo the extent that we rely on, or partner with, third parties to commercialize Twirla, we may receive less revenue than if we commercialized these products ourselves. In addition, we would have less control over the sales efforts of any other third parties involved in our commercialization efforts. We, however, will remain responsible for the conduct of any contract sales force, which could expose us to legal and regulatory enforcement actions and liability. In the event that we are unable to partner with a third-party marketing and sales organization, our ability to generate product revenues may be limited.\nTwirla could develop unexpected safety, efficacy or quality concerns, which would likely have a material adverse effect on us.\nTwirla was approved in the U.S. based on the SECURE clinical trial, in which patients were enrolled for 13 cycles of treatment. Twirla will now be used by larger numbers of patients, potentially for longer periods of time, and we and others (including regulatory agencies and private payors) will endeavor to collect extensive information on the efficacy and safety of Twirla by monitoring its use in the marketplace. In addition, we will endeavor to conduct the PMR. New safety or efficacy data from both market surveillance and our post-marketing clinical trials may result in negative consequences including:\n\u25cf Modification to product labeling or promotional statements, such as additional boxed or other warnings contraindications, or limitations, or the issuance of \u201cDear Doctor Letters\u201d or similar communications to healthcare professionals or the public regarding safety or efficacy concerns;\n\u25cf Imposition of additional post-marketing clinical trial requirements, distribution restrictions or other risk management measures, such as a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, REMS, which could include elements to assure safe use;\n\u25cf Suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approval;\n\u25cf Suspensions or termination of ongoing clinical trials or refusal by regulators to approve pending marketing applications or supplements to approved applications;\n\u25cf Suspension of, or imposition of restrictions on, our operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements with respect to Twirla;\n\u25cf Costly and time-consuming corrective actions; and\n\u25cf Voluntary or mandatory product recalls or withdrawals from the market and costly product liability claims.\nFurthermore, the discovery of significant problems with a product similar to Twirla that implicate (or are perceived to implicate) the entire class of products could have an adverse impact on our ability to commercialize Twirla. Any of these circumstances could reduce Twirla\u2019s market acceptance and could inhibit or delay our ability to commercialize Twirla or gain and/or sustain market share, any of which could adversely affect sales of Twirla.\nSales of Twirla may be adversely affected by the consolidation among wholesale drug distributors and the growth of large retail drug store chains.\nThe network through which we will sell Twirla and our potential product candidates, if and when approved, has undergone significant consolidation marked by mergers and acquisitions among wholesale distributors and the growth of large retail drugstore chains. As a result, a small number of large distributors control a significant share of the market. In 2021, three companies generated about 95% of all revenues from drug distribution in the United States, and, the top five chain pharmacy companies owned about 54% of all retail pharmacy outlets. Consolidation of drug wholesalers and retailers, as well as any increased pricing pressure that those entities face from their customers, including the U.S. government, may increase pricing pressure and place other competitive pressures on drug manufacturers, including us.\nExisting and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to commercialize Twirla and may affect the prices we may obtain.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell Twirla. In addition, legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We do not know\nwhether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA\u2019s regulations, guidance or interpretations will change, or what the impact of such changes on our ability to market Twirla may be.\nIn March 2010, President Obama signed into law the ACA. Of particular relevance to our business is the ACA requirement that all health plans, with limited exceptions, cover certain preventive services for women with no cost-sharing, which means no deductible, no co-insurance and no co-payments by the patient - including contraceptive methods, known as the contraceptive mandate. For discussion on the ACA requirements for contraceptive coverage and applications to Twirla, see Part 1, Item 1, Pricing and Reimbursement and Part 1, Item 1, Government Regulation. The ACA appears likely to continue to apply pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs. There are several proposals to reform the federal healthcare laws being advocated and it is still unclear whether such reform efforts will succeed and if so, which proposals will ultimately be successful. Further, the Biden administration may choose to change or reverse regulatory decisions made by the previous administration. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the full effect of the ACA or any other healthcare reform efforts on our business. Since its enactment, there have been numerous judicial, administrative, executive, and legislative challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. Litigation and legislation related to the ACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results.\nConsistent with precedent, we expect that additional federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, and in turn could significantly reduce the projected value of Twirla and our potential product candidates and reduce our profitability.\nOther measures - such as provisions of the Medicare Modernization Act that would allow importation of drugs from Canada - have also been taken by Congress, the previous administration, and administrative agencies to increase drug competition and thus, decrease drug prices. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. New legislative and regulatory efforts could ultimately have an adverse impact on our business and results of operation.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Capital\nWe have incurred operating losses in each year since our inception and expect to continue to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future. Management has concluded that these factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe have incurred losses in each year since our inception in December 1997. Our net loss was $74.9 million, $51.9 million and $18.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $387 million. Our cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to fund our current and planned operations through the 12 months following the date on which this Annual Report on Form 10-K is filed, which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern may create negative reactions to the price of our common stock and we may have a more difficult time obtaining financing in the future.\nSpecialty pharmaceutical product development is a speculative undertaking, involves a substantial degree of risk and is a capital-intensive business. We expect to incur expenses without corresponding revenues until we are able to sell Twirla in significant quantities, which may not happen. We have devoted most of our financial resources to research and development, including our non-clinical development activities and clinical trials. We will require additional capital to fund our operating needs beyond April 2022, including among other items, the commercialization of Twirla and advancing the development of our other potential product candidates. We may not be able to obtain sufficient additional funding to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce, or even terminate, our operations. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through sales of common stock, convertible preferred stock and convertible promissory notes and to a lesser extent, through term loans and government grants.\nWe expect that our expenses will increase as we continue to commercialize Twirla. As a result, we expect to continue to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future. We are uncertain when or if we will be able to achieve or sustain profitability. If we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Any failure to become and remain profitable could impair our ability to sustain operations and adversely affect the price of our common stock and our ability to raise additional capital. We are significantly dependent on the success of Twirla, and if we do not achieve the commercial success of Twirla and/or are unable to obtain additional funding, we will need to reassess our operating capital needs and may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce, or even terminate, our operations.\nWe will need to obtain additional financing to fund our operations and, if we are unable to obtain such financing, we may be unable to commercialize Twirla or resume development of our pipeline.\nOur operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since our inception. From our inception to December 31, 2021, we have cumulative net cash flows used by operating activities of $339.8 million. We will need to obtain additional capital to fund our future operations, including the commercialization of Twirla. We will need to obtain additional financing to resume development of our pipeline. Moreover, our fixed expenses such as rent, interest expense and other contractual commitments are substantial and are expected to increase in the future.\nOur future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf Our ability to successfully commercialize Twirla;\n\u25cf Our ability to have commercial product successfully manufactured in compliance with FDA regulations;\n\u25cf Amount of sales and other revenues from Twirla, including the selling prices and the availability of adequate third-party coverage and reimbursement;\n\u25cf Our ability to control our operating expenses and inventory levels in relation to the revenue growth of Twirla;\n\u25cf Our ability to meet our minimum purchase requirements under our supply agreement with Corium, our third party manufacturer;\n\u25cf Sales and marketing costs associated with commercializing Twirla, including the cost and timing of expanding our marketing and sales capabilities and infrastructure;\n\u25cf Time and cost necessary to obtain regulatory approvals for our other potential product candidates that may be required by regulatory authorities;\n\u25cf Progress, timing, scope and costs of our clinical trials, including the ability to timely enroll subjects in the PMR;\n\u25cf Terms and timing of any potential future collaborations, licensing or other arrangements that we may establish;\n\u25cf Cash requirements of any future acquisitions or pipeline development;\n\u25cf Time and cost necessary to respond to technological and market developments;\n\u25cf Costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf Costs associated with any potential business or product acquisitions, strategic collaborations, licensing agreements or other arrangements that we may establish;\n\u25cf Costs associated with the commercial manufacturing process for Twirla and/or the establishment of a backup supplier; and\n\u25cf Costs associated with the hiring of new employees and maintaining our contract sales force.\nOur ability to fund our operations through the period of time necessary to successfully commercialize Twirla could be adversely affected based on the risks impacting our ability to successfully commercialize Twirla discussed above. Until we can generate a sufficient amount of revenue, we may finance future cash needs through public or private equity offerings, license agreements, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and marketing or distribution arrangements, some of which may (1) risk dilution of our current stockholders and/or (2) require us to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or potential product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. We may seek to access the public or private capital markets whenever conditions are favorable, even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time.\nWe may not be able to obtain sufficient additional funding to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce, or even terminate, our operations. Adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when needed or on attractive terms, or if we are unable to enter into strategic collaborations, we then may be unable to complete the commercialization of Twirla and may also be required to further cut operating costs, delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or future commercialization efforts or even terminate our operations, which may involve seeking bankruptcy protection. Our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operating requirements is a forward-looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors, including the factors discussed elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. We have based this estimate on a number of assumptions that may prove to be wrong and changing circumstances beyond our control may cause us to consume capital more rapidly than we currently anticipate. If we choose to accelerate any elements of our commercial plan or we encounter any unforeseen events that affect our business plan, we may choose to raise additional funds to provide us with additional working capital. Our inability to obtain additional funding when we need it could seriously harm our business and we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce, or even terminate, our operations.\nWe have never been profitable. Currently, we have only one product available for commercial sale, Twirla, and we may never become profitable.\nWe have never been profitable and do not expect to be profitable in the foreseeable future. Except for Twirla, we have no other products currently available for commercial sale. To date, we have generated very limited revenue from product sales. As we commercialize Twirla, there can be no assurance that we will generate significant revenues or ever achieve profitability. Our ability to generate product revenue depends on a number of factors, including the risks related to our ability to commercialize Twirla discussed herein.\nIn addition, because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product commercialization and pipeline development, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses, or when, or if, we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. In addition, our expenses could increase beyond our current expectations and resources if we are required to provide increased rebates to managed care payors, need to increase our manufacturing capacity sooner than planned, experience disruptions in our manufacturing capabilities, or need to alter our marketing strategy.\nWe anticipate incurring significant costs associated with the commercialization of Twirla. Our ability to become and remain profitable depends on our ability to generate revenue in excess of our increasing costs. Even accounting for revenues from the sale of Twirla, we may not become profitable and may need to obtain additional funding to continue operations. If we fail to become profitable or obtain additional funding or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce our operations. In the event we are not able to continue operations at planned levels, we may not be able to realize the carrying value of our commercial manufacturing equipment due to the specialized nature of the equipment and the possible lack of an alternative future use for such commercial manufacturing equipment. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would decrease the value of our company and could impair our ability to raise additional capital, expand our business or continue our operations.\nOur operating activities may be restricted as a result of covenants related to the outstanding indebtedness under our loan agreement and we may be required to repay the outstanding indebtedness in an event of default, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business.\nIn February 2020, we entered into the Perceptive Credit Agreement, the terms of which are described in more detail in Part 2, Item 7, Financial Overview. The Perceptive Credit Agreement subjects us to various customary affirmative and negative covenants, which are described in Part 2, Item 8, Note 9 to Financial Statements. Our business may be adversely affected by these restrictions on our ability to operate our business. The Perceptive Credit Agreement also subjects us to financial covenants in respect of minimum liquidity and minimum product revenue.\nThe loans provided under the Perceptive Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of our property. The Perceptive Credit Agreement contains certain customary Events of Default, which include, among others, non-payment of principal, violation of covenants, inaccuracy of representations and warranties, bankruptcy and insolvency events, material judgments, certain regulatory-related events and events constituting a Change of Control (as defined in the Perceptive Credit Agreement). We may not have enough available cash or be able to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings to repay such indebtedness at the time any such Event of Default occurs. In that case, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our pipeline development or commercialization efforts or grant to others rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. Perceptive could also exercise its rights as collateral agent to take possession and dispose of the collateral securing the loan for its benefit, which collateral includes substantially all of our property. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected as a result of any of these events.\nUnstable global market and economic conditions may have serious adverse consequences on our business, financial condition and share price.\nThe global economy, including credit and financial markets, has experienced extreme volatility and disruptions, including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates, increases in inflation rates and uncertainty about economic stability. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in widespread unemployment, economic slowdown and extreme volatility in the capital markets. Similarly, the current conflict between Ukraine and Russia has created extreme volatility in the global capital markets and is expected to have further global economic consequences, including with respect to global supply chain and energy concerns. Any such volatility may have adverse consequences on us or the third parties on whom we rely. If the equity and credit markets deteriorate, including as a result of political unrest or war, it may make any necessary debt or equity financing more difficult to obtain in a timely manner or on favorable terms, more costly or more dilutive.\nRisks Relating to Maintaining Regulatory Compliance and Approval of Twirla\nWe remain subject to substantial ongoing regulatory requirements related to Twirla, and failure to comply with these requirements could lead to penalties, including withdrawal from the market, suspension, or withdrawal of product approval.\nTwirla is subject to ongoing regulatory requirements governing the manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, import, export, safety surveillance, advertising, marketing promotion, recordkeeping, reporting of adverse events and other post-market information, and further development, including ongoing requirements for costly post-marketing studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials or post-market surveillance. For more information about the planned Phase 4 studies for Twirla, see Part 1, Item 1, Twirla. The results generated in these post-approval clinical trials could result in loss of marketing approval, changes in product labeling, or new or increased concerns about side effects or efficacy of a product. Failure to comply with post-market study requirements can also result in different enforcement actions.\nPost-approval requirements include registration with the FDA, listing of our drug products, payment of annual fees, as well as continued compliance with cGCPs for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. Application holders must notify the FDA, and depending on the nature of the change, obtain FDA pre-approval for product manufacturing changes. In addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to continual review and routine\ninspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with the FDA\u2019s manufacturing requirements relating to quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents. If we are found to be noncompliant with applicable requirements, we may be subject to different enforcement actions.\nIn addition, our product labeling, advertising and promotional materials for Twirla will be subject to regulatory requirements and continuing review by the FDA, Department of Justice, Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office of Inspector General, state attorneys general, members of Congress and the public. The FDA strictly regulates the promotional claims that may be made about prescription products, and the FDA has requested that companies enter into consent decrees of permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. In particular, a product may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA as reflected in the product\u2019s approved labeling, a practice known as off-label promotion. Engaging in the impermissible promotion of our products for off-label uses can also subject us to false claims litigation under federal and state statutes. If we or any third parties contracted to promote our product on our behalf are found to have promoted such off-label uses, we may become subject to significant liability, government fines, civil and criminal penalties, and other enforcement actions. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant sanctions. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has enjoined several companies from engaging in off-label promotion. Since 2004, these False Claims Act lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies have increased significantly in volume and breadth, leading to several substantial civil and criminal settlements regarding certain sales practices promoting off-label drug uses involving fines that are as much as $3.0 billion.\nIf we or a regulatory agency discover previously unknown problems with Twirla, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, data integrity issues with regulatory filings, advertising and promotion, problems with the facility where the product is manufactured or we or our manufacturers or others working on our behalf fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements after marketing approval, we may be subject to reporting obligations as well as enforcement actions, such as Warning Letters, Cyber Letters, Untitled Letters, consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, clinical holds or termination of clinical trials, criminal and civil penalties, including imprisonment, suspensions or impositions of restrictions on operations such as costly new manufacturing requirements or product seizures or detentions.\nWe may also be subject, directly or indirectly through our customers and partners, to various fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute, U.S. False Claims Act and similar state laws, which impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing and scientific/educational efforts. Federal criminal statutes also prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters. We are also subject to complex laws and regulations regarding reporting and payment obligations due to our participation in government drug programs. All of these activities are also potentially subject to U.S. federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. Analogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and drug pricing; and state laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by federal law, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nThe occurrence of any event or penalty described herein may inhibit our ability to commercialize Twirla and generate revenue. Adverse regulatory action, whether pre- or post-approval, can also potentially lead to product liability claims and increase our product liability exposure. Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations are costly. Compliance with these and other federal and state laws applicable to the sale, marketing, and distribution of commercial drug products will require that we expend time and financial resources to maintain compliance, and it is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations.\nRisks Related to Manufacturing and Our Reliance on Third Parties\nWe have no manufacturing capacity and anticipate continued reliance on Corium, our third-party manufacturer, for the commercialization of Twirla and development of our potential product candidates, as a sole source provider. We may not have or be able to obtain sufficient quantities of Twirla or our potential product candidates to meet our required supply for commercialization or clinical trials. Alternatively, we may not realize the commercial demand for Twirla necessary to meet our obligations to Corium. Either of these events could materially harm our business.\nWe rely on Corium, our third-party manufacturer, to produce commercial supplies and samples of Twirla. We have no back-up or alternative manufacturer of Twirla. We do not own or operate, and have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities for Twirla. We lack the resources and the capabilities to manufacture Twirla or any of our potential product candidates on a commercial or clinical scale.\nAs a third-party manufacturer, Corium\u2019s business operations are completely beyond our control, and we have no influence over whether Corium changes its management or its business operations or discontinues them entirely. Furthermore, we do not control the manufacturing process of Twirla. Corium or other contract manufacturers that we may use are subject to routine inspection by regulatory authorities, including the FDA. If our contract manufacturer cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA, they may receive adverse inspectional findings, may need to undertake costly and time consuming corrective actions, and may not be able to maintain regulatory approval for their manufacturing facilities and may expose us to enforcement actions. If the FDA withdraws its approval of Corium\u2019s facilities for the manufacture of Twirla, or if Corium experiences quality or other regulatory issues, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities that would also require FDA approval, which would significantly impact our ability to develop and sustain our market share of Twirla.\nCorium may experience issues in the manufacturing process for Twirla. The custom machinery used to manufacture Twirla could malfunction at any time, creating a delay in manufacturing as Corium secures replacement parts, repairs and revalidates the equipment and manufacturing process, or, if the equipment cannot be repaired, we seek to secure alternative third party manufacturers. Any such delays could limit our ability to meet commercial demand for Twirla, or to do so at an acceptable cost, either of which could delay, prevent, or impair the commercialization of Twirla.\nAlthough we have manufacturing agreements with Corium for the commercial supply of Twirla, Corium and several of its suppliers of raw materials will likely be single source providers to us for a significant period of time. In particular, Corium manufactures Twirla using EE and LNG and components that it purchases from third parties, most of which are single source suppliers of the applicable material. We do not have any control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these raw materials by Corium. Corium\u2019s failure to timely obtain, or a disruption in the supply of, these raw materials could lead to an inability to adequately supply the commercial market with finished product of Twirla and in turn adversely affect our business. Further, we cannot predict how the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic will affect Corium\u2019s ability to obtain raw materials in the future.\nBecause we outsource all of our manufacturing processes, there is no guarantee that there will be sufficient supplies to fulfill our requirements or that we may obtain such supplies on acceptable terms. In addition, we are required to meet quantity minimums under our supply agreement with Corium. We may not realize sufficient commercial demand for Twirla to meet these obligations, which may result in periodic delays in the manufacturing process, penalty payments, or termination of the agreement. For example, during 2021, we did not meet all of our minimum quantity purchases from Corium, and as a result, paid penalties as defined in the contract. If it becomes necessary to engage an additional third-party manufacturer to produce Twirla, we may need to license certain manufacturing know-how from Corium, and our commercial supply will be limited while the new third-party manufacturer develops the necessary know-how to manufacture Twirla and while we obtain regulatory approval for the addition of a new manufacturer and processes.\nIf Corium or any third-party manufacturer with whom we contract fails to perform its obligations or if our relationship is terminated for any reason, we may be forced to manufacture the materials ourselves, for which we may not have the capabilities or resources, or enter into an agreement with a different third-party manufacturer, which we may not be able to do on reasonable terms, if at all. In either scenario, our commercial supply of Twirla and clinical trials\nsupply for other potential product candidates could be delayed significantly as we establish alternative supply sources in accordance with FDA regulations and requirements, which we may be unable to do expediently or without conducting additional studies, if at all. The delays associated with the verification of a new contract manufacturer could negatively affect our ability to commercialize our products, including Twirla, and to develop our other potential product candidates.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct aspects of our clinical trials and post marketing studies. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or comply with applicable regulatory requirements, we may not be able to maintain regulatory approval for Twirla or develop our pipeline.\nWe currently rely and plan to continue to rely on CROs and clinical trial sites for most aspects of our post-marketing study and any other clinical trials of our potential product candidates, such as trial conduct, data management, statistical analysis and electronic compilation of our FDA submission. We may enter into agreements with additional CROs and clinical trial sites to obtain additional resources and expertise in an attempt to accelerate our progress with regard to new or ongoing clinical and preclinical programs, which involves substantial cost and requires extensive management time and focus. Delays may occur, which may materially impact our ability to meet our desired post-marketing and clinical development timelines and ultimately have a material adverse impact on the commercialization of Twirla, our ability to maintain our marketing authorization for Twirla, our operating results, financial condition or future prospects. For example, we plan to engage the services of a CRO to design, enroll, and complete the PMR, which will likely involve thousands of subjects and hundreds of clinical trial sites and will require substantial time and resources. If the CRO and/or clinical trial sites cannot enroll subjects and complete the trial in a timely manner, we may be unable to complete the study required by the FDA and subsequently may lose our marketing authorization for Twirla or be subject to other enforcement actions, and be forced to suspend commercial activities regarding the product.\nAs CROs and clinical investigators are not our employees, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our clinical trials for which they are engaged to perform, and whether they comply with the applicable regulatory requirements, including requirements related to the conduct of the study, subject informed consent, and IRB approval. If the CROs or clinical trial sites we engage do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations, conduct the clinical trials in accordance with all regulatory requirements and the applicable protocols, or meet expected deadlines, or if they need to be replaced, or the quality or accuracy of the data they provide is compromised due to a failure to adhere to regulatory requirements or for other reasons, then our development programs may be extended, delayed or terminated, we may not be able to obtain marketing approval for or successfully commercialize our potential product candidates, or we may not be able to meet our post-market study requirements. Failure to comply with clinical trial regulatory requirements may further subject us to enforcement actions. As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for Twirla or our potential product candidates could be harmed and our costs could increase.\nWe may rely on third parties to perform many essential services for any products that we commercialize, including services related to government price reporting, customer service, accounts receivable management, cash collection, and pharmacovigilance and adverse event reporting. If these third parties fail to perform as expected or to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, our ability to commercialize our potential product candidates will be significantly impacted and we may be subject to regulatory sanctions.\nWe may retain third-party service providers to perform a variety of functions related to Twirla, key aspects of which will be out of our direct control. These service providers may provide key services related to customer service, accounts receivable management, cash collection, pharmacovigilance and adverse event reporting, safety database management, fulfillment of requests for medical information regarding Twirla, and related services. If these third-party service providers fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, fail to meet expected deadlines, or otherwise do not carry out their contractual duties to us, or encounter physical or natural damage at their facilities, our ability to deliver product to meet commercial demand would be significantly impaired and we may be subject to enforcement actions.\nWe may further contract with a third party to calculate and report pricing information mandated by various government programs. If a third party fails to timely report or adjust prices as required, or errors occur in calculating government pricing information from transactional data in our financial records, it could impact our discount and rebate liability, and potentially subject us to regulatory sanctions or False Claims Act lawsuits.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property Rights\nWe may not be able to protect our proprietary technology in the marketplace.\nWe depend on our ability to protect our proprietary technology. We rely on trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws, and confidentiality, licensing and other agreements with employees and third parties, all of which offer only limited protection. Our success depends in large part on our ability and any future licensee\u2019s ability to maintain our patents and to obtain additional patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and products. If we are compelled to spend significant time and money protecting or enforcing our patents, designing around patents held by others or licensing or acquiring, potentially for large fees, patents or other proprietary rights held by others, our business and financial prospects may be harmed. If we are unable to effectively protect the intellectual property that we own, other companies may be able to offer for sale the same or similar products containing the generically available active pharmaceutical ingredients in Twirla and our potential product candidates, which could materially adversely affect our competitive business position and harm our business prospects.\nOur patents may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing the same or similar products or limit the length of the term of patent protection that we may have for our potential product candidates. Even if our patents are unchallenged, they may not adequately protect our intellectual property, provide exclusivity for our potential product candidates or prevent others from designing around our claims. Any of these outcomes could impair our ability to prevent competition from third parties, which may have an adverse impact on our business.\nThe patent positions of pharmaceutical products are often complex and uncertain. The breadth of claims allowed in pharmaceutical patents in the United States and many jurisdictions outside of the United States is not consistent, and the breadth and strength of our patents may not be sufficient to prevent competition from similar or identical products. For example, in many jurisdictions the support standards for pharmaceutical patents are becoming increasingly strict. Some countries prohibit method of treatment claims in patents. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property or create uncertainty. In addition, publication of information related to our current product and pipeline products may prevent us from obtaining or enforcing patents relating to this product and pipeline products, including without limitation transdermal delivery systems and methods of using such transdermal delivery systems. Our product and pipeline products contain generically available active pharmaceutical ingredients. As a result, new chemical entity patents directed to the active pharmaceutical ingredients in our product and pipeline products, which are generally believed to offer the strongest form of patent protection, are not available.\nWe may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which may prevent or delay our commercialization and product development efforts or increase the costs of commercializing Twirla, or our potential product candidates, when and if approved.\nOur commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties. For example, there could be issued patents of which we are not aware that Twirla or our current or future potential product candidates infringe. There also could be patents that we believe we do not infringe, but that we may ultimately be found to infringe.\nThird parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization and may sue us for patent or other intellectual property infringement or misappropriation. Third parties could similarly claim that our employees, consultants, or contractors have misappropriated their intellectual property, including know-how or trade secrets of a third party, in violation of nondisclosure agreements or noncompete agreements in place with the third party. These lawsuits are costly and could adversely affect our results of operations and divert the attention of managerial and scientific personnel. If we are sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that our product, potential product candidates or methods either do not infringe the claims of the relevant patent or that the patent claims are invalid or unenforceable, which is difficult and which we may not be able to do, and even if successful will result in substantial costs and time, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Successful third party claims could block our ability to\ncommercialize Twirla or potential product candidates, if approved, and could result in liability and monetary damages, any of which could materially harm our business.\nAny lawsuits relating to infringement of intellectual property rights brought by or against us will be costly and time consuming and may adversely impact the price of our common stock.\nWe may be required to initiate litigation to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights. These lawsuits can be very time consuming and costly. There is a substantial amount of litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical industry generally. Such litigation or proceedings, if we have the time and/or resources to pursue them, could substantially increase our operating expenses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. Any recovery may not be commercially valuable and our confidential information and trade secrets may become publicly available during the course of litigation discovery.\nIn infringement litigation, any award of monetary damages we receive may not be commercially valuable. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial or other resources to file and pursue such infringement claims, which typically last for years before they are resolved. Further, any claims we assert against a perceived infringer could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we have infringed their patents. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nIn addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments, and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations and Industry\nThe ongoing outbreak of the novel strain of coronavirus, or COVID-19, or other similar public health crises, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including our ability to successfully produce, market, and distribute Twirla\u00ae.\nThe ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been and will likely continue to be extensive, affecting many aspects of society, and it has resulted in and will likely continue to result in significant disruptions to global business activities and capital markets around the world, including as emerging variants of the virus, such as the delta and omicron variants, are detected and continue to spread. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, or similar pandemics, we may experience disruptions that could severely affect our business, including our plans to clinically develop and commercialize our products. We may not be able to meet expectations with respect to the commercialization and post-market study of Twirla. In addition, global business interruptions resulting from COVID-19, including ongoing global supply chain issues, may adversely impact our third-party manufacturer, Corium, whom we rely upon for the manufacture of Twirla, as well as its suppliers of raw materials. If Corium or any of its suppliers of raw materials are adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic or the restrictions resulting from the pandemic, if they cannot obtain the necessary supplies, or if such third parties need to prioritize other products or customers over us, including under the Defense Production Act of 1950, or the Defense Production Act, we may experience delays or disruptions in our supply chain, which could have a material and adverse impact on our business. Third party manufacturers may also need to implement measures and changes, or deviate from typical requirements because of the COVID-19 pandemic that may otherwise adversely impact our supply chains or the quality of the resulting products or supplies. Depending on the change, we may need to obtain FDA pre-approval or otherwise provide FDA with a notification of the change. As a result, we may not be able to obtain sufficient quantities of Twirla, which could impair our ability to commercialize Twirla and conduct the PMR. In addition, if there are continued or future disruptions, our third-party manufacturers may not be able to supply our other potential product candidates, which would adversely affect our research and development activities.\nFurther, the pandemic has led and may continue to lead to travel restrictions, flight cancellations and social distancing requirements in many areas of the world, any of which may have a material adverse impact on the third-party consultants and agents who assist us with our sales and marketing functions, as well as on our ability to develop our own sales and marketing infrastructure. For example, such social distancing orders could limit the ability of sales representatives to interact with healthcare providers and also restrict the ability of patients to interact with their healthcare providers and obtain prescriptions for our products. Patients may also be more reticent to visit their providers to obtain Twirla prescriptions during the COVID-19 pandemic. This could negatively affect our ability to commercialize Twirla.\nDelays in the ability to manufacture commercial supplies of Twirla and disruptions in the operation of a sales force for Twirla could also adversely affect our financial position. Three vaccines for COVID-19 have been granted Emergency Use Authorization by FDA, and one has subsequently been granted full FDA approval, and additional booster shots have been authorized for most populations. The resultant demand for vaccines and potential for manufacturing facilities and materials to be commandeered under the Defense Production Act, or equivalent foreign legislation, may make it more difficult to obtain materials or manufacturing slots for the products needed for our clinical trials and/or commercial product, which could lead to delays in these trials and/or issues with our commercial supply. If the COVID-19 pandemic or other factors impact our current business plan or our ability to generate revenue from the launch of Twirla, we believe we have the ability to revise our commercial plans, including curtailing sales and marketing spending, to allow us to continue to fund our operations. However, significant delays in the timelines to manufacture commercial supply of Twirla, and/or the ability of a salesforce to engage with healthcare providers could delay, or even prevent, our ability to generate revenue, which in turn could require us to raise additional capital if the revisions to our commercial plans are inadequate or management determines that it is necessary.\nIf we are not successful in attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel, we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy.\nOur ability to compete in the highly competitive pharmaceuticals industry depends in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial, scientific and medical personnel. Our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled junior, mid-level and senior managers as well as junior, mid-level and senior scientific and medical personnel. Competition for skilled personnel in our market is intense and competition for experienced personnel may limit our ability to hire and retain highly qualified personnel on acceptable terms. We are highly dependent on our management, scientific and medical personnel. In order to induce valuable employees to remain with us, we have provided these employees with stock options that vest over time. The value to employees of stock options that vest over time is significantly affected by movements in our stock price that we cannot control and may at any time be insufficient to counteract more lucrative offers from other companies. Additionally, at times, we have also implemented programs that included cash retention bonuses and/or restricted stock units as incentives to retain employees.\nDespite our efforts to retain valuable employees, members of our management, scientific and medical teams may terminate their employment with us on short notice. We have employment agreements with our named executive officers which includes Alfred Altomari, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The employment agreements provide for at-will employment, which means that Mr. Altomari or any of our other employees could leave our employment at any time, with or without notice. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could potentially harm our business, operating results or financial condition. In particular, we believe that the loss of the services of Mr. Altomari may have a material adverse effect on our business. We do not currently carry \u201ckey person\u201d insurance on the lives of members of executive management.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of Twirla.\nWe face potential risks of product liability as a result of the clinical testing and commercial availability of Twirla and the clinical testing of our other potential product candidates. For example, we may be sued if Twirla or any potential product candidate we develop allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing,\ndefects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability and a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization or development of the product or potential product candidate subject to such claims. Even a successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in a decreased demand for Twirla or any future potential product candidates that we may develop, injury to our reputation, withdrawal of clinical trial participants, a diversion of management\u2019s time and our resources, substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients, product recalls or withdrawals, loss of revenue, the inability to commercialize Twirla or our potential product candidates, if approved, or a decline in our stock price, among other negative impacts.\nWe have obtained limited product liability insurance coverage for Twirla and our clinical trials with a $10.0 million annual aggregate coverage limit. Although we maintain such insurance, any claim that may be brought against us could result in a court judgment or settlement in an amount that is not covered, in whole or in part, by our insurance or that is in excess of the limits of our insurance coverage. Our insurance policies also have various exclusions, and we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no coverage. We may have to pay any amounts awarded by a court or negotiated in a settlement that exceed our coverage limitations or that are not covered by our insurance, and we may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient capital to pay such amounts.\nBusiness interruptions, including those resulting from systems failures, could delay us in the process of developing our potential product candidates and could disrupt our sales.\nOur headquarters are located in Princeton, New Jersey, and Corium, our contract manufacturer, is located in Grand Rapids, Michigan. We are vulnerable to natural disasters, such as severe storms and other events that could disrupt our or Corium\u2019s operations. We do not carry insurance for natural disasters, and we may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur. In addition, despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems, and those of other third parties on which we rely, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures, cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions over the internet, attachments to emails, persons inside our organization, or persons with access to systems inside our organization. Any losses or damages we incur could have a material adverse effect on our business operations. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further commercialization of Twirla and/or development of our potential product candidates could be delayed.\nOur employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, CROs, manufacturers, consultants, commercial partners and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading, which could significantly harm our business.\nWe are exposed to the risk that employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, CROs, manufacturers, consultants, commercial partners and vendors may engage in fraudulent or other illegal activity, fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless or negligent conduct or disclosure of unauthorized activities to us that violates: (i) the law and regulations of the FDA and non-U.S. regulators, including those laws that require the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to the FDA and non-U.S. regulators, (ii) healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the United States and abroad and (iii) laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Misconduct in violation of these laws may also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. We have adopted a code of conduct, but it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by our employees and other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not\nsuccessful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including enforcement actions, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.\nOur ability to use net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain built-in losses to reduce future tax payments may be limited by provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and may be subject to further limitation as a result of our initial public offering.\nSections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, contain rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an ownership change, which is generally any change in ownership of more than 50% of its stock over a three-year period, to utilize its net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain built-in losses recognized in years after the ownership change. These rules generally operate by focusing on ownership changes involving stockholders owning, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of the stock of a company and any change in ownership arising from a new issuance of stock by the company. Generally, if an ownership change occurs, the yearly taxable income limitation on the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain built-in losses is equal to the product of the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate and the value of the company\u2019s stock immediately before the ownership change. We may be unable to offset future taxable income, if any, with losses, or our tax liability with credits, before such losses and credits expire and therefore would incur larger federal income tax liability. Our net operating loss carryforwards arising in taxable years ending on or prior to December 31, 2017 will expire between 2019 and 2037 if we have not used them. Net operating loss carryforwards arising in taxable years ending after December 31, 2017 are no longer subject to expiration under the Code.\nIn addition, it is possible that the transactions relating to our initial public offering or subsequent public offerings, either on a standalone basis or when combined with future transactions, have caused us to undergo one or more additional ownership changes. In that event, we generally would not be able to use our pre-change loss or credit carryovers or certain built-in losses prior to such ownership change to offset future taxable income in excess of the annual limitations imposed by Sections 382 and 383 of the Code. We have not completed a study to assess whether an ownership change has occurred, or whether there have been multiple ownership changes since our inception.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nWe are not in compliance with the Nasdaq continued listing requirements. If we are unable to comply with the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market, our common stock could be delisted, which could affect our common stock's market price and liquidity and reduce our ability to raise capital.\nOn November 9, 2021, we received a letter from the Nasdaq Stock Market, or Nasdaq, indicating that we have failed to comply with the minimum bid price requirement, which requires that companies listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market maintain a minimum closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share (\u201cBid Price Requirement\u201d). The notification of noncompliance had no immediate effect on the listing or trading of our common stock.\nIn accordance with Nasdaq rules, we have a 180-calendar day grace period, or until May 9, 2022 (the \u201cCompliance Date\u201d), to regain compliance with the Bid Price Requirement. The continued listing standard would have been met if our common stock had a minimum closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days during the 180-calendar day grace period. If we do not regain compliance with the Bid Price Requirement by the Compliance Date, Nasdaq may grant an additional 180 calendar day compliance period, if we meet the continued listing requirement for value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for The Nasdaq Capital Market and provide written notice of our intention to cure the deficiency during the second 180 calendar day compliance period by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary.\nIf we do not regain compliance within the allotted compliance period(s), including any extensions that may be granted by Nasdaq, Nasdaq will provide notice that our common stock will be subject to delisting. At that time, we may appeal the Nasdaq staff's determination to a Hearings Panel.\nWe intend to monitor the closing bid price of our common stock and consider our available options to resolve the noncompliance with the Bid Price Requirement. There can be no assurance that we will be able to regain compliance with the Bid Price Requirement or will otherwise be in compliance with other Nasdaq listing criteria. If our securities are delisted, it could be more difficult to buy or sell our securities and to obtain accurate quotations, and the price of our securities could suffer a material decline. Delisting could also impair the liquidity of our common stock and could harm our ability to raise capital through alternative financing sources on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and may result in potential loss of confidence by investors, employees, and fewer business development opportunities.\nOur intended Reverse Stock Split might not be successful in maintaining our Nasdaq listing.\nWe have asked our stockholders to vote on a Reverse Stock Split. Our Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock will vote with the outstanding common stock on the Reverse Stock Split to be determined by the Board of Directors within a set range. The holders of our Series A Preferred Stock have the right to cast approximately 3,846 votes per share of Series A Preferred Stock on the Reverse Stock Split. The holders of our Series B Preferred Stock have the right to cast 500,000 votes per share of Series B Preferred Stock provided, that such votes must be counted by us in the same proportion as the aggregate shares of common stock and Series A Preferred Stock voted on the Reverse Stock Split. As an example, if the holders of 50.5% of the outstanding common stock and Series A Preferred Stock are voted in favor of the Reverse Stock Split, we can count 50.5% of the votes cast by the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock as votes in favor of the Reverse Stock Split. The voting rights of the Preferred Stock were established in an effort to maintain our Nasdaq listing by raising the minimum bid price of our common stock over $1.00 for ten consecutive trading days. However, there can be no assurances that we will be able to achieve a majority of votes in favor of the Reverse Stock Split. If we are unable to implement the reverse stock split, we might be delisted from Nasdaq.\nWe expect that our stock price may fluctuate significantly.\nThe trading price of our common stock is highly volatile and is subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including limited trading volume. In addition to the factors discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this annual report, these factors include:\n\u25cf Actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results;\n\u25cf Actual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\n\u25cf Announcements by us, our collaborators or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, collaborations or capital commitments;\n\u25cf Failure to meet or exceed financial estimates and projections of the investment community or that we provide to the public;\n\u25cf Issuance of new or updated research or reports by securities analysts, including reports that downgrade our common stock, issue unfavorable commentary, or analyst decisions to stop reporting on us or our business;\n\u25cf Fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\u25cf Share price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;\n\u25cf Announcement or expectation of additional debt or equity financing efforts;\n\u25cf Sales of our common stock by us, our insiders or our other stockholders; and\n\u25cf General economic and market conditions.\nThese and other market and industry factors may cause the market price and demand for our common stock to fluctuate substantially, regardless of our actual operating performance, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock. In addition,\nthe stock market in general, and the Nasdaq Capital Market and the stock prices of pharmaceutical companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies.\nCertain of our outstanding common stock purchase warrants contain price protection provisions (anti-dilution protection) in the event that we sell our securities at prices lower than the current exercise price of such warrants, which may have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock or impair our ability to raise capital.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had 1,850,000 common stock purchase warrants outstanding that were issued in connection with the Perceptive Credit Agreement that contain price protection provisions in the event that we sell securities at a price per share below their respective exercise prices on or before December 31, 2022 (collectively \u201cPrice Protection Warrants\u201d). The current exercise prices of the Price Protection Warrants are: 700,000 Price Protection Warrants - $3.11, 700,000 Price Protection Warrants - $3.83 and 450,000 Price Protection Warrants - $2.43. In the event that we sell securities at a price per share lower than the current exercise price of the Price Protection Warrants on or before December 31, 2022, their exercise prices will be reduced pursuant to a weighted-average anti-dilution formula. Any future adjustments to the exercise prices of the Price Protection Warrants may have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock. Additionally, raising additional capital with new investors may be difficult as a result of the adjustment feature.\nWe may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile, and in the past companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could adversely impact our business. Any adverse determination in litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting in the future, we may not be able to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nEffective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. We cannot guarantee that our disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, will meet the objectives of the control system or that such system will not be circumvented by human error or bad actors. In addition, any testing by us conducted in connection with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to our financial statements or require us to identify other areas for further attention or improvement. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting once that firm conducts its Section 404 reviews, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the Nasdaq Capital Market, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.\nWe have never paid dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, any gains from an investment in our common stock will likely depend on whether the price of our common stock increases.\nWe have not paid dividends on our common stock to date and we currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law may discourage or prevent a change of control, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, which could affect our stock price adversely and prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our board of directors that our stockholders might consider favorable. Some of these provisions:\n\u25cf Authorize the issuance of preferred stock which can be created and issued by the board of directors without prior stockholder approval, with rights senior to those of our common stock;\n\u25cf Provide for a classified board of directors, with each director serving a staggered three-year term;\n\u25cf Prohibit our stockholders from filling board vacancies, calling special stockholder meetings or taking action by written consent;\n\u25cf Provide for the removal of a director only with cause and by the affirmative vote of the holders of 75% or more of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of our directors;\n\u25cf Require advance written notice of stockholder proposals and director nominations; and\n\u25cf Require any action instituted against our officers or directors in connection with their service to the Company to be brought in the state of Delaware.\nIn addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These and other provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are opposed by our then-current board of directors, including a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving our company. This provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders. Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our board of directors could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.", "PERMNO": 14645, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "AGRX"}
