{"cik": "1622893", "company": "Journal Media Group, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-31", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nYou should consider carefully the risks described below, together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in evaluating our company and our common stock. If any of the risks described below actually occurs, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial results, financial condition and/or stock price.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Business\nWe have no history operating as a stand-alone, publicly traded company on which you can evaluate our performance.\nWe have no operating history as a combined business or as a stand-alone, publicly traded company. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our business strategy and operations will be successful. We may not be able to grow or integrate our business as planned and may not be profitable.\nNo historical financial statements showing our operation of the newspaper publishing businesses of Scripps and Journal as a combined, stand-alone company exist upon which you can evaluate our prospects.\nSince we have not operated the newspaper publishing businesses of Scripps and Journal on a combined, stand-alone basis, we do not have any historical financial statements as an independent, stand-alone company upon which you can evaluate us.\nThe historical financial information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is not indicative of our future results as a stand-alone, publicly traded company.\nThe historical carve-out financial statements of the Scripps newspaper business have been created from Scripps\u2019 financial information. Accordingly, the historical carve-out financial information for the Scripps newspaper business included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K does not reflect the Journal newspaper business and, thereby, does not reflect what our financial position, results of operations and cash flows would have been had those businesses been operated as a combined business and a stand-alone, publicly traded company during the periods presented. Nor is such information indicative of what our results of operations, financial position and cash flows may be in the future. This is primarily a result of the following factors:\n\u2022\nthe historical Journal newspaper business financial statements are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and pursuant to SEC guidance are not required to be so included;\n\u2022\nthe historical carve-out financial statements do not reflect certain changes that will occur in our funding and operations as a result of the separation of Scripps Spinco and Journal Spinco from Scripps and Journal, respectively;\n\u2022\nour financial information reflects estimated allocations for services historically provided by our parent company to Scripps Spinco, and we expect these allocations to be different from the costs we will incur for these services in the future; and\n\u2022\nthe historical financial information does not reflect the potential for increased or duplicative costs we may incur in becoming a stand-alone, publicly traded company, such as costs attributable to transition service agreements we will have with Scripps, or changes in historical cost structure due to our differing personnel needs, financing activities and operations.\nFor these or other reasons, our future financial performance will be different from the performance implied by the historical carve-out information of Scripps newspapers presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFor additional information about the past financial performance of the Scripps newspaper business, please see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d and the historical carve-out\nfinancial statements and the accompanying notes of Scripps Newspapers included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe integration of the newspaper businesses of Journal and Scripps will be time consuming, may distract our management from operations, and will be expensive, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nIf we are not successful in integrating the newspaper operations of Scripps and Journal, or if the integration is more difficult or costly than anticipated, we may experience disruptions to our operations. A difficult or unsuccessful integration of these businesses would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nSome of the risks that may affect our ability to integrate or realize any anticipated benefits include those associated with:\n\u2022\nadverse effects on employees and business relationships with customers and suppliers;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in conforming standards, processes, procedures and controls of the businesses;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in transferring processes and know-how;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations, technologies or products; and\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from business concerns.\nWe will need to either contract for or internally develop a number of key services and functions that our parent companies have historically provided.\nWe have not previously performed the various corporate functions required of a publicly traded company. Scripps and Journal, the parent companies, have historically performed many important corporate functions for each of the businesses and will continue to do so before the newspaper mergers, including finance, treasury, tax administration, risk management, accounting, internal audit, financial reporting, legal, regulatory, human resources, employee benefit administration, communications, information technology, digital and business development services. After the transactions close, Scripps will provide a number of services to us for a limited time under the transition services agreement. When these transition services cease to be provided, we will need to replace these services internally or through third parties. The services obtained from Scripps will be provided at fair market value, which nonetheless may be higher than the costs borne in the past. Replacement services may be available only on terms that are less favorable to us, or may not be available to us at all.\nWe will also need to replicate certain facilities, systems and infrastructure to which we will no longer have access, as well as hire new employees to provide these services. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain these services or hire the necessary employees at similar cost-levels or at all. In addition, our management will have to spend considerable time in building an independent infrastructure for corporate, administrative and information technology functions. These initiatives will be costly to implement, and the scope and complexity of these projects may be materially higher than expected.\nIf we do not have adequate systems and business functions of our own or cannot obtain them from third party providers at an acceptable cost, we may not be able to operate our business effectively, which could have a material adverse effect on profitability.\nWe may not realize the benefits expected by combining the newspaper businesses of Scripps and Journal into a new publicly traded company and may experience increased costs after the newspaper mergers that could decrease overall profitability.\nBefore the newspaper mergers, our business was part of two separate public companies. We may experience difficulties in integrating the two businesses into one company, and the newspaper mergers may result in increased costs and inefficiencies in our business operations and management. Integration of our businesses may cost significantly more or take longer than anticipated, which could decrease profitability or otherwise impact expected cost-savings. In addition, prior to the newspaper mergers our businesses took advantage of the economies of scale of Scripps and Journal. As a separate, stand\u00adalone, publicly traded company, we may be unable to obtain goods, services and technology at prices or on terms as favorable as those obtained prior to the newspaper mergers, which could decrease overall profitability. Furthermore, we may not be successful in transitioning from the services and systems provided by Scripps and Journal and may incur substantially higher costs for implementation than currently anticipated. At such point in time as we begin to operate these functions independently, if we do not have in place adequate systems and business functions, or outsource them from other providers, we may not be able to operate our business effectively or at comparable costs, which may have a material adverse effect on our profitability. Failure\non our part to realize the anticipated benefits of the newspaper mergers, including, without limitation, the anticipated cost-savings resulting from operating synergies and growth opportunities from combining the businesses, could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.\nRestrictions on our operations, and our obligations to indemnify Scripps and its shareholders in connection with the tax-free treatment of the spin-offs and newspaper mergers, could materially and adversely affect us.\nCertain tax-related restrictions and indemnities set forth in the tax matters agreements agreed to by Scripps, Journal and us in order to maintain the tax-free treatment of the spin-offs and newspaper mergers limit our discretion in the operation of our business and could adversely affect us. Under these provisions, we:\n\u2022\nhave generally undertaken to maintain the current newspaper business of Scripps and Journal as an active business for a period of two years following the completion of the newspaper mergers;\n\u2022\nare generally restricted, for a period of two years following the newspaper mergers, from (i) reacquiring our stock, (ii) issuing stock to any person other than as compensation for services, (iii) making changes in equity structure, (iv) liquidating, merging or consolidating certain of our subsidiaries, (v) transferring certain material assets except in the ordinary course of business, and (vi) entering into negotiations with respect to, or consenting to, certain acquisitions of our stock;\n\u2022\nare generally restricted from taking any other action (including an action that would be inconsistent with the representations relied upon by Scripps and Journal described above) that could jeopardize the tax-free status of the spin-offs; and\n\u2022\nhave generally agreed to indemnify Scripps and Journal for taxes and related losses incurred as a result of the spin-offs (other than the spin-off of Journal Spinco, which will be taxable to Journal) failing to qualify as tax-free transactions provided such taxes and related losses are attributable to any act, failure to act or omission by us or our subsidiaries, including our failure to comply with applicable representations, undertakings and restrictions placed on our actions under the tax matters agreements.\nThese prohibitions could discourage, delay or prevent equity financings, acquisitions, investments, strategic alliances, mergers and other transactions, possibly resulting in a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, any indemnity obligations to Scripps or Journal could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and liquidity.\nAny financing arrangements we may enter into may subject us to various restrictions that could limit operating flexibility.\nWe currently expect to enter into a credit facility prior to the completion of the transactions and we expect that the credit facility will contain certain covenants and other restrictions that, among other things, will require us to satisfy certain financial tests and maintain certain financial ratios and restrict our ability to pay dividends, incur additional indebtedness and create liens. The restrictions and covenants in any such financing arrangements may limit our ability to respond to market conditions, provide for capital investment needs or take advantage of business opportunities by limiting the amount of additional borrowings we may incur.\nWe will no longer be able to rely on Scripps and Journal for diversification of business risk or to provide capital resources.\nBefore the newspaper mergers, the newspaper businesses were operated as separate businesses of two different companies. Following the newspaper mergers, our ability to satisfy obligations and maintain profitability will be solely dependent upon our performance, and we will not be able to rely upon the financial and other resources of Scripps and Journal.\nWe may be required to satisfy certain indemnification obligations to our former parent companies or may not be able to collect on indemnification rights from our former parent companies.\nUnder the terms of the master transaction agreement, Scripps (as successor to Journal) will indemnify us, and we will indemnify Scripps (as successor to Journal), for all damages, liabilities and expenses resulting from a breach by the applicable party of the covenants contained in the master transaction agreement that continue in effect after the closing. Scripps (as successor to Journal) will indemnify us for all damages, liabilities and expenses incurred by us relating to the entities, assets and liabilities retained by Scripps or Journal, and we will indemnify Scripps (as successor to Journal) for all damages, liabilities and expenses incurred by us relating to our entities, assets and liabilities.\nIn addition, Scripps will indemnify us, and we will indemnify Scripps for all damages, liabilities and expenses resulting from a breach by the other of any of the representations, warranties or covenants contained in the tax matters agreements. We will also indemnify Scripps for all damages, liabilities and expenses arising out of any tax imposed with respect to the Scripps Spinco spin-off if such tax is attributable to any act, any failure to act or any omission by us or any of our subsidiaries. Scripps will indemnify us for all damages, liabilities and expenses relating to pre-closing taxes or taxes imposed on us or our subsidiaries because Scripps Spinco or Journal Spinco was part of the consolidated return of Scripps or Journal, and we will indemnify Scripps for all damages, liabilities and expenses relating to post-closing taxes of ours or our subsidiaries.\nThe indemnification obligations described above could be significant and we cannot presently determine the amount, if any, of indemnification obligations for which we will be liable or for which we will seek payment from Scripps. Our ability to satisfy these indemnities will depend upon future financial performance. Similarly, the ability of Scripps to satisfy any such obligations to us will depend on its future financial performance. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to satisfy any substantial obligations to Scripps or that Scripps (including Scripps as successor to Journal) will have the ability to satisfy any substantial indemnity obligations to us.\nDecreases in advertising spending, resulting from economic downturn, war, terrorism, advertiser consolidation or other factors, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nHad we operated as an independent company in 2014, approximately 60% of our revenue would have been generated from the sale of local, regional and national advertising appearing in newspapers and shoppers. Advertisers generally reduce their advertising spending during economic downturns and some advertisers may go out of business or declare bankruptcy. The merger or consolidation of advertisers, such as in the banking and airline industries, also generally leads to a reduced amount of collective advertising spending. A recession or economic downturn, as well as a consolidation of advertisers in the future could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Terrorist attacks or other wars involving the United States or any other local or national crisis could also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, some of our printed publications are expected to generate a large percentage of their advertising revenue from a limited number of sources, including the automotive industry. As a result, even in the absence of a recession or economic downturn, adverse changes specifically affecting these advertising sources could significantly reduce advertising revenue and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we expect advertising revenue and subscription revenue to depend upon a variety of other factors specific to the communities that we will serve. Changes in those factors could negatively affect those revenues. These factors include, among others, the size and demographic characteristics of the local population, the concentration of retail stores and local economic conditions in general. If the population demographics, prevailing retail environment or local economic conditions of a community to be served by us were to change adversely, revenue could decline and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe will operate in highly competitive markets, and during a time of rapid competitive changes, we may lose market share and advertising revenue to competing publications, or other competitors, as well as through consolidation of competitors or changes in advertisers\u2019 buying strategies.\nOur businesses will operate in highly competitive markets. Our newspapers, shoppers and Internet sites will compete for audiences and advertising revenue with other newspapers, television and radio stations, shoppers and Internet sites as well as with other media such as magazines, outdoor advertising, direct mail and the evolving mobile and digital advertising space. Some of our potential competitors have greater financial, marketing and programming resources than we will or, even if smaller in size or in terms of financial resources, a greater ability to create digital niche products and communities and may respond faster or more aggressively to changing competitive dynamics. This competition has intensified as a result of digital media technologies. While the amount of advertising on Journal\u2019s and Scripps\u2019 digital products has continued to increase, each of Journal and Scripps has experienced, and in the future we may continue to experience, a decrease in advertising revenues.\nIn newspapers and shoppers, our revenue is expected to primarily consist of advertising revenue and subscription revenue. Competition for advertising expenditures and subscription revenue is expected to come from local, regional and national newspapers, shoppers, magazines, broadcast and cable television, radio, direct mail, Yellow Pages, digital Internet and mobile products and other media. Competition for newspaper advertising revenue is based largely upon advertiser results, advertising rates, readership, demographics and circulation levels, while competition for subscription revenue is based largely upon the content of the newspaper, its price, editorial quality and customer service. Our local and regional competitors in community publications are typically unique to each market, but we will have many competitors for advertising revenue that are larger and have greater financial and distribution resources than us. Subscription revenue and our ability to achieve price increases for our\nprint products will be affected by competition from other publications and other forms of media available in our various markets, declining consumer spending on discretionary items like newspapers, decreasing amounts of free time, and declining frequency of regular newspaper buying among young people. We may incur increasing costs competing for advertising expenditures and paid print and digital subscriptions. If we are not able to compete effectively for advertising expenditures and paid print and digital subscriptions, our revenue may decline and our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe print newspaper business is in secular decline. Our profitability may be adversely affected if we are not successful in creating other revenue opportunities or in aligning costs with declining revenues.\nIn recent years, the advertising industry generally has experienced a secular shift toward digital advertising and away from other traditional media. In addition, Scripps\u2019 and Journal\u2019s newspaper circulation has declined, reflecting general trends in the newspaper industry, including consumer migration toward the Internet and other media for news and information. We expect to face increasing competition from other digital sources for both advertising and subscription revenues. This competition has intensified as a result of the continued development of digital media technologies. Distribution of news, entertainment and other information over the Internet, as well as through smartphones, tablets and other devices, continues to increase in popularity. These technological developments are increasing the number of media choices available to advertisers and audiences. As media audiences fragment, we expect advertisers to continue to allocate larger portions of their advertising budgets to digital media.\nIn response to the ongoing secular changes, we must continually monitor and align cost structure to declining revenues. The alignment of our costs includes measures such as reduction in force initiatives, standardization and centralization of systems and processes, outsourcing of certain financial processes and the implementation of new software for circulation, advertising and editorial systems.\nIf we are not successful in creating other revenue opportunities, developing digital media or aligning costs with declining revenues, our profitability could be adversely affected.\nWe expect a significant portion of operating cost to come from newsprint, so an increase in price or reduction in supplies may adversely affect our operating results.\nWe expect newsprint to be a significant portion of our operating costs. The price of newsprint has historically been volatile, and increases in the price of newsprint could materially reduce our operating results. In addition, the continued reduction in the capacity of newsprint producers increases the risk that supplies of newsprint could be limited in the future. Our publishing business may suffer if there is a significant increase in the cost of newsprint or a reduction in the availability of newsprint.\nChanges relating to consumer information collection and use could adversely affect our ability to collect and use data, which could harm our business.\nPublic concern over methods of information gathering has led to the enactment of legislation in most jurisdictions that restricts the collection and use of consumer information. Our publishing business is expected to rely in part on telemarketing sales, which are affected by \u201cdo not call\u201d legislation at both the federal and state levels. We also expect to engage in e-mail marketing and the collection and use of consumer information in connection with our publishing businesses and our growing digital efforts. Further legislation, government regulations, industry regulations, the issuance of judicial interpretations or a change in customs relating to the collection, management, aggregation and use of consumer information could materially increase the cost of collecting that data, or limit our ability to provide information to our customers or otherwise utilize telemarketing or e-mail marketing or distribute our digital products across multiple platforms, and could adversely affect our results of operations.\nDecreases in circulation may adversely affect subscription revenues, and circulation decreases may accelerate as we offer expanded digital content and digital subscriptions.\nAdvertising and subscription revenues are affected by the number of subscribers and single copy purchasers, readership levels and overall audience reach. The newspaper industry as a whole is experiencing difficulty maintaining paid print circulation and related revenues. This is due to, among other factors, increased competition from new media products and sources other than traditional newspapers (often free to users), and shifting preferences among some consumers to receive all or a portion of their news other than from a newspaper. In addition, our planned expanded digital content and new digital subscriptions could negatively impact print circulation volumes if readers cancel subscriptions.\nA prolonged decrease in circulation could have a material effect on our revenues, particularly if we are not able to otherwise grow readership levels and overall audience reach. To maintain Journal\u2019s and Scripps\u2019 circulation base, we may incur additional costs, and we may not be able to recover these costs through subscription and advertising revenues.\nIf we are unable to respond to changes in technology and evolving industry standards and trends, our publishing operations may not be able to effectively compete.\nThe publishing industry is being challenged by the preferences of today\u2019s \u201con demand\u201d culture, particularly among younger segments of the population. Some consumers prefer to receive all or a portion of their news in new media formats and from sources other than traditional newspapers. Information delivery and programming alternatives such as the Internet, various mobile devices, electronic readers, cable, direct satellite-to-home services, pay-per-view and home video and entertainment systems have fractionalized newspaper readership. New digital subscription offerings may not attract readers in sufficient numbers to generate significant revenues or offset losses in paid print subscription revenues. The shift in consumer behaviors has the potential to introduce new market competitors or change the means by which traditional newspaper advertisers can most efficiently and effectively reach their target audiences. We may not have the resources to acquire new technologies or to introduce new products or services that could compete with these evolving technologies.\nFollowing completion of the transactions, we will face cybersecurity and similar risks, which could result in the disclosure of confidential information, disruption of our operations, damage to our brands and reputation, legal exposure and financial losses.\nSecurity breaches, computer malware or other \u201ccyber attacks\u201d could harm our business by disrupting our delivery of services, jeopardizing our confidential information and that of our vendors and clients, and damaging our reputation. Our operations are expected to routinely involve receiving, storing, processing and transmitting sensitive information. Although we will monitor our security measures regularly and believe we are not in a key target industry, any unauthorized intrusion, malicious software infiltration, theft of data, network disruption, denial of service, or similar act by any party could disrupt the integrity, continuity, and security of our systems or the systems of our clients or vendors. These events could create financial liability, regulatory sanction, or a loss of confidence in our ability to protect information, and adversely affect our revenue by causing the loss of current or potential clients.\nRisk Factors Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nBecause there has not been any public market for our common stock, the market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile, it will not be possible to predict how our common stock will perform, and you may not be able to sell your shares at or above the initial market price of our stock following the newspaper mergers.\nPrior to the newspaper mergers, there has been no trading market for our common stock. We cannot predict the extent to which investors\u2019 interest will lead to a liquid trading market or whether the market price of our common stock will be volatile. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nas a result of the risk factors listed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K;\n\u2022\nif our business does not fit the investment objectives of the shareholders of our former parent companies, causing them to sell our shares after the newspaper mergers;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nfor reasons unrelated to our specific performance, such as reports by industry analysts, investor perceptions, or negative announcements by our customers or competitors regarding their own performance; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and industry conditions.\nAccordingly, no assurances can be provided as to the prices at which trading in our common stock will occur after the transactions.\nCertain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws, and provisions of Wisconsin law, could delay or prevent a change of control that you may favor.\nProvisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or other change of control that shareholders may consider favorable or may impede the ability of the holders of our common stock to change our board or management. The provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws, among other things, will:\n\u2022\nprohibit shareholder action except at an annual or special meeting, thus not allowing our shareholders to act by written consent;\n\u2022\nregulate how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at annual meetings of shareholders by requiring advance notice of such proposals or nominations;\n\u2022\nregulate how special meetings of shareholders may be called; and\n\u2022\nauthorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock in one or more series, without shareholder approval. Under this authority, our board of directors could adopt a rights plan which could ensure continuity of management by rendering it more difficult for a potential acquiror to obtain control of us.\nOur indemnification obligations under the tax matters agreement entered into in connection with the newspaper mergers could prevent a change in control.\nAn acquisition of our stock or further issuance of our stock could cause Scripps or the shareholders of Scripps or Journal to recognize a taxable gain or income on the spin-off of Scripps Spinco. Under the tax matters agreement we would be required to indemnify Scripps or the shareholders of Scripps or Journal, as the case may be, for the resulting tax, and this indemnity obligation might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control that you may consider favorable.\nOur ability to pay dividends will be limited by our financial results and our credit facility; we do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe anticipate that future earnings will be used principally to support operations and finance the growth of our business. Thus, we do not intend to pay dividends or make other cash distributions on our common stock in the foreseeable future. In connection with the newspaper mergers, we expect to enter into a credit facility providing for both term and revolving credit borrowings. The new facility will likely contain affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, will require us to satisfy certain financial tests and maintain certain financial ratios. We expect that the new facility will likely also limit our ability to declare and pay dividends or make other distributions on our shares of common stock. If our lenders permit us to declare dividends, the dividend amounts, if any, will be determined by our board of directors, which will consider a number of factors, including our financial condition, capital requirements, funds generated from operations, future business prospects, and applicable contractual restrictions.\nOur accounting and other management systems and resources may not be adequate to meet our reporting obligations as a public company.\nThe financial results of Journal\u2019s and Scripps\u2019 newspaper businesses previously were included within the consolidated results of Journal and Scripps, respectively, and we were not subject to the reporting and other requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d). As a result of the transactions, we will be subject to reporting and other obligations under the Exchange Act. The Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. Following a transition period after the transactions, we will be responsible for ensuring that all aspects of our business comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), which will require annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and a report by an independent registered public accounting firm addressing these assessments. Although our management is has experience with these reporting and related obligations, ensuring compliance with respect to our business may place significant demands on management, administrative and operational resources, including accounting systems and resources.\nUnder the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we are required to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. To comply with these requirements, we may need to upgrade our systems; implement additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures; and hire additional accounting and finance staff. We expect to incur additional annual expenses for the purpose of addressing these requirements, and those expenses may be significant. If we are unable to upgrade financial and management controls, reporting systems, information technology\nsystems and procedures in a timely and effective fashion, our ability to comply with our financial reporting requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies under the Exchange Act could be impaired. Any failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced reporting requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d). For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d including the exemption from compliance with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. We will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (a) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (b) the date that we become a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, or (c) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period.\nUnder the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.", "PERMNO": 15228, "SIC": 2711, "TIC": "JMG"}
