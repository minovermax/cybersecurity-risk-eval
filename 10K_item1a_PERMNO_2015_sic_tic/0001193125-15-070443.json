{"cik": "713676", "company": "PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-02", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nWe are subject to a number of risks potentially impacting our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. As a financial services organization, certain elements of risk are inherent in our transactions and operations and are present in the business decisions we make. Thus, we encounter risk as part of the normal course of our business, and we design risk management processes to help manage these risks.\nOur success is dependent on our ability to identify, understand and manage the risks presented by our business activities so that we can appropriately balance revenue generation and profitability. These risks include, but are not limited to, credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, model risk, technology, compliance and legal risk, and strategic and reputation risk. We discuss our principal risk management processes and, in appropriate places, related historical performance in the Risk Management section included in Item 7 of this Report.\nThe following are the key risk factors that affect us. Any one or more of these risk factors could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, in addition to presenting other possible adverse consequences, including those described below. These risk factors and other risks are also discussed further in other sections of this Report.\nDifficult economic conditions or volatility in the financial markets would likely have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nAs a financial services company, PNC\u2019s business and overall financial performance are vulnerable to the impact of poor or weak economic conditions, particularly in the United States but also to some extent in the global economy. Recessionary conditions, particularly if severe such as was experienced starting in 2007 and ending in 2009, are likely to have a negative financial impact across the financial services industry, including on PNC. Recessionary economic conditions can lead to turmoil and volatility in financial markets, which can increase the adverse impact on financial institutions such as PNC, with the impact increased to the extent the conditions are more severe. A return to recessionary economic conditions in the United States would likely adversely affect PNC, its business and financial performance, with the impact potentially as or more detrimental than that of the last recession.\nThe economic recovery from the last recession continued in 2014, but at a slower pace than for recoveries from prior recessions. Although unemployment rates have dropped significantly from the highest levels during the recession, employment is not yet at robust levels. Consumer and business confidence is improving but remains in the cautious zone.\nAlthough Congress and the President have recently been able to reach agreement on budgets and the U.S. government\u2019s debt ceiling, significant long-term issues remain with respect to federal budgetary and spending matters, and it is unclear whether agreements to resolve these issues will be reached, particularly in light of the divided state of the U.S. government. Uncertainty resulting from these issues and recent difficulties in resolving these types of matters could contribute to slower economic growth. Another period where the Congress and the President cannot reach resolution of key federal budgetary and spending matters, leading to events such as actual or threatened government shutdowns or defaults, could adversely affect the U.S. economy. In recent years, a downgrade in the ratings for U.S. Treasury securities by a credit rating agency, an extended government shutdown, and substantial spending cuts through sequestration have resulted from government stalemate on budgetary issues.\nThe global recession and disruption of the financial markets led to concerns over the solvency of certain European countries, affecting these countries\u2019 capital markets access and in some cases sovereign credit ratings, as well as market perception of financial institutions that have significant direct or indirect exposure to these countries. These concerns continue even as the global economy is recovering and some previously stressed European economies have experienced at least partial recoveries from their lowpoint during the recession. If measures to address sovereign debt and financial sector problems in Europe are inadequate, they may delay or weaken economic recovery, or result in the exit of one or more member states from the Eurozone or more severe economic and financial conditions. If realized, these risk scenarios could contribute to severe financial market stress or a global recession, likely affecting the economy and capital markets in the United States as well.\nOther Risk Factors, presented below, address specific ways in which we may be adversely impacted by economic conditions.\nOur business and financial results are subject to risks associated with the creditworthiness of our customers and counterparties.\nCredit risk is inherent in the financial services business and results from, among other things, extending credit to customers, purchasing securities, and entering into financial derivative transactions and certain guarantee contracts. Credit risk is one of our most significant risks, particularly given the high percentage of our assets represented directly or indirectly by loans and the importance of lending to our overall business. We manage credit risk by assessing and monitoring the creditworthiness of our customers and counterparties and by diversifying our loan portfolio. Many factors impact credit risk.\nA borrower\u2019s ability to repay a loan can be adversely affected by several factors, such as business performance, job losses or\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. - Form 10-K 15\nhealth issues. A weak or deteriorating economy and changes in the United States or global markets also could adversely impact the ability of our borrowers to repay outstanding loans. Any decrease in our borrowers\u2019 ability to repay loans would result in higher levels of nonperforming loans, net charge-offs, provision for credit losses and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, and other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client.\nDespite maintaining a diversified loan portfolio, in the ordinary course of business, we may have concentrated credit exposure to a particular person or entity, industry, region or counterparty. Events adversely affecting specific customers, industries, regions or markets, a decrease in the credit quality of a customer base, or an adverse change in the risk profile of a market, industry, or group of customers could adversely affect us.\nOur credit risk may be exacerbated when collateral held by us to secure obligations to us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices that are not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us.\nIn part due to improvement in economic conditions, as well as actions taken by PNC to manage its portfolio, PNC\u2019s provision for credit losses has declined substantially every year since the end of the recent recession. If we were to once again experience higher levels of provision for credit losses, it could result in lower levels of net income.\nOur business and financial performance is impacted significantly by market interest rates and movements in those rates. The monetary, tax and other policies of governmental agencies, including the Federal Reserve, have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance over which we have no control and which we may not be able to predict adequately.\nAs a result of the high percentage of our assets and liabilities that are in the form of interest-bearing or interest-related instruments, changes in interest rates, in the shape of the yield curve, or in spreads between different market interest rates can have a material effect on our business, our profitability and the value of our financial assets and liabilities. For example:\n\u2022\nChanges in interest rates or interest rate spreads can affect the difference between the interest that we earn on assets and the interest that we pay on liabilities,\nwhich impacts our overall net interest income and profitability.\n\u2022\nSuch changes can affect the ability of borrowers to meet obligations under variable or adjustable rate loans and other debt instruments, and can, in turn, affect our loss rates on those assets.\n\u2022\nSuch changes may decrease the demand for interest rate-based products and services, including loans and deposit accounts.\n\u2022\nSuch changes can also affect our ability to hedge various forms of market and interest rate risk and may decrease the effectiveness of those hedges in helping to manage such risks.\n\u2022\nMovements in interest rates also affect mortgage prepayment speeds and could result in impairments of mortgage servicing assets or otherwise affect the profitability of such assets.\nThe monetary, tax and other policies of the government and its agencies, including the Federal Reserve, have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance. These governmental policies can thus affect the activities and results of operations of banking companies such as PNC. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the national supply of bank credit and certain interest rates. The actions of the Federal Reserve influence the rates of interest that we charge on loans and that we pay on borrowings and interest-bearing deposits and can also affect the value of our on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments. Both due to the impact on rates and by controlling access to direct funding from the Federal Reserve Banks, the Federal Reserve\u2019s policies also influence, to a significant extent, our cost of funding. We cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary, tax and other policies or the effects that they may have on our activities and financial results. The current very low interest rate environment has had a negative impact on our ability to increase our net interest income, and its continuation, which is expected at least through mid-year 2015 based on statements by the Chair of the Federal Reserve, could affect consumer and business behavior in ways that are adverse to us in addition to continuing to affect our net interest income. Even once the Federal Reserve begins increasing the interest rates it directly influences, there may be a prolonged period before interest rates return to more historically typical levels.\nIn addition, monetary and fiscal policy actions by governmental and regulatory decision makers in other countries or in the European Union could have an impact on global interest rates, affecting rates in the United States as well as rates on instruments denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar, any of which could have one or more of the potential effects on PNC described above.\n16 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. - Form 10-K\nOur business and financial performance are vulnerable to the impact of changes in the values of financial assets.\nAs a financial institution, a substantial majority of PNC\u2019s assets and liabilities are financial in nature (items such as loans, securities, servicing rights, deposits and borrowings). Such assets and liabilities will fluctuate in value, often significantly, due to movements in the financial markets or market volatility as well as developments specific to the asset or liability in question.\nCredit-based assets and liabilities will fluctuate in value due to changes in the perceived creditworthiness of the borrowers and also due to changes in market interest rates. A lessening of confidence in the creditworthiness of the United States or other governments whose securities we hold could impact the value of those holdings. Changes in loan prepayment speeds, usually based on fluctuations in market interest rates, could adversely impact the value of our mortgage servicing rights. The financial strength of counterparties, with whom we have hedged some of our exposure to certain types of assets, could affect the value of such transactions and assets. Additionally, the underlying value of an asset under lease may decrease due to supply and demand for the asset or the condition of the asset at the end of the lease. This could cause our recorded lease value to decline.\nIn many cases, PNC marks its assets and liabilities to market on its financial statements, either through its Net income and Retained earnings or through adjustments to Accumulated other comprehensive income on its balance sheet. We may need to record losses in the value of financial assets even where our expectation of realizing the face value of the underlying instrument has not changed.\nIn addition, asset management revenue is primarily based on a percentage of the value of the assets being managed and thus is impacted by general changes in market valuations. Thus, although we are not directly impacted by changes in the value of such assets, decreases in the value of those assets would affect related fee income.\nOur business and financial performance are dependent on our ability to attract and retain customers for our products and services, which may be negatively impacted by a lack of consumer and business economic confidence as well as our actions, including our ability to anticipate and satisfy customer demands for products and services.\nAs a financial institution, our performance is subject to risks associated with the loss of customer confidence and demand. Economic and market developments, in the United States, Europe or elsewhere, may affect consumer and business confidence levels. If customers lose confidence due to a weak or deteriorating economy or uncertainty surrounding the future\nof the economy, the demand for our products and services could suffer.\nWe may also fail to attract or retain customers if we are unable to develop and market products and services that meet evolving customer needs or demands or if we are unable to deliver them effectively and securely to our customers, particularly to the extent that our competitors are able to do so.\nNews or other publicity that impairs our reputation, or the reputation of our industry generally, also could cause a loss of customers.\nIf we fail to attract and retain customers, demand for our loans and other financial products and services could decrease and we could experience adverse changes in payment patterns. We could lose interest income from a decline in credit usage and fee income from a decline in product sales, investments and other transactions. PNC\u2019s customers could remove money from checking and savings accounts and other types of deposit accounts in favor of other banks or other types of investment products. Deposits are a low cost source of funds. Therefore, losing deposits could increase our funding costs and reduce our net interest income.\nFor several years, the United States has been in a very low interest rate environment. This situation has decreased the attractiveness of alternatives to bank checking and savings accounts, which may lack deposit insurance and some of the convenience associated with more traditional banking products and which may no longer be able to offer much higher interest rates. If interest rates were to rise significantly, customers may be less willing to maintain balances in non-interest bearing or low interest bank accounts, which could result in a loss of deposits or a relatively higher cost of funds to PNC. This could also result in a loss of fee income.\nIn our asset management business, investment performance is an important factor influencing the level of assets that we manage. Poor investment performance could impair revenue and growth as existing clients might withdraw funds in favor of better performing products. Additionally, the ability to attract funds from existing and new clients might diminish. Overall economic conditions may limit the amount that customers are able or willing to invest as well as the value of the assets they do invest. The failure or negative performance of products of other financial institutions could lead to a loss of confidence in similar products offered by us without regard to the performance of our products. Such a negative contagion could lead to withdrawals, redemptions and liquidity issues in such products and have a material adverse impact on our assets under management and asset management revenues and earnings.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. - Form 10-K 17\nAs a regulated financial services firm, we are subject to numerous governmental regulations, and the financial services industry as a whole is subject to significant regulatory reform initiatives in the United States and elsewhere.\nPNC is a bank holding company (BHC) and a financial holding company and is subject to numerous governmental regulations involving both its business and organization.\nOur businesses are subject to regulation by multiple banking, consumer protection, securities and derivatives regulatory bodies. Applicable laws and regulations restrict our ability to repurchase stock or to receive dividends from subsidiaries that operate in the banking and securities businesses and impose capital adequacy requirements. PNC\u2019s ability to service its obligations and pay dividends to shareholders is largely dependent on the receipt of dividends and advances from its subsidiaries, primarily PNC Bank. The Federal Reserve requires a BHC to act as a source of financial and managerial strength for its subsidiary banks. The Federal Reserve could require PNC to commit resources to PNC Bank when doing so is not otherwise in the interests of PNC or its shareholders or creditors.\nApplicable laws and regulations restrict permissible activities and investments and require compliance with protections for loan, deposit, brokerage, fiduciary, mutual fund and other customers, and for the protection of customer information, among other things. We are also subject to laws and regulations designed to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and transactions with persons, companies or foreign governments designated by U.S. authorities.\nStarting shortly after the beginning of the financial crisis in 2007, we have faced, and expect to continue to face for the foreseeable future, increased regulation of the financial services industry as a result of initiatives intended to promote the safety and soundness of financial institutions, financial market stability, the transparency and liquidity of financial markets, and consumer and investor protection. We also expect, in many cases, more intense scrutiny from bank, consumer protection and other supervisors in the examination process and more aggressive enforcement of laws and regulations on both the federal and state levels. Compliance with regulations and other supervisory initiatives will likely increase the company\u2019s costs and reduce its revenue, and may limit the company\u2019s ability to pursue certain desirable business opportunities. New reforms will also introduce additional legal risk (including as a result of newly applicable antifraud and anti-manipulation provisions and private rights of action) and affect regulatory oversight, applicable capital and liquidity requirements, and residential mortgage and other consumer financial products. The consequences of noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations can include substantial monetary and nonmonetary sanctions as well as damage to our reputation and businesses.\nA number of reform provisions are likely to significantly impact the ways in which banks and BHCs, including PNC, do business. Some of the reform initiatives have led to the formation of new regulatory bodies, such as the CFPB, which has authority to regulate consumer financial products and services sold by banks and non-bank companies and to supervise banks with assets of more than $10 billion and their affiliates for compliance with federal consumer protection laws. Other agencies have significant new powers relevant to PNC, such as the authority now held by the CFTC to regulate non security-based swaps, which, among other things, led PNC Bank to register with the CFTC as a swap dealer in early 2013.\nSee Supervision and Regulation in Item 1 of this Report for more information concerning the regulation of PNC and recent initiatives to reform financial institution regulation, including some of the matters discussed in this Risk Factor. Note 20 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report also discusses some of the regulation applicable to PNC.\nThe following describes the key risks associated with some of the initiatives recently undertaken as part of the regulatory reform initiatives affecting the financial services industry, either where pending rules have not yet been finalized or where the impact of new rules has not been substantially realized.\n\u2022\nIn December 2013, the U.S. banking agencies, the SEC and the CFTC adopted regulations implementing the Volcker Rule provisions of Dodd-Frank. The Volcker Rule prohibits banks and their affiliates from engaging in some types of proprietary trading and restricts the ability of banks and their affiliates to sponsor, invest in or have specified other financial relationships with certain types of private funds (referred to as covered funds). We discuss the Volcker Rule in the Supervision and Regulation section included in Item 1 of this Report. PNC discontinued its designated proprietary trading operations several years ago. We currently do not expect the proprietary trading aspects of the final regulations to have a material effect on PNC\u2019s businesses or revenue. Nevertheless, the Volcker Rule regulations place limits and conditions on many types of permissible trading activities, including transactions conducted for purposes of hedging, liquidity management, underwriting or to facilitate customer transactions. These limits and restrictions could cause PNC to forego engaging in hedging or other transactions that it would otherwise undertake in the ordinary course of business and, thus, to some extent, may limit the ability of PNC to most effectively hedge its risks, manage its balance sheet or provide products or services to its customers.\n\u2022\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2014, PNC held interests in private equity and hedge funds that are\n18 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. - Form 10-K\ncovered funds subject to the Volcker Rule regulations totaling approximately $579 million, including $140 million of sponsored funds. Certain of PNC\u2019s REIT Preferred Securities also were issued by statutory trusts that, as currently structured, are considered covered funds. As of December 31, 2014, PNC also held approximately $1.5 billion of senior debt interests in collateralized loan obligations and certain other investment securities that may be considered ownership interests in covered funds. The unrealized loss associated with these securities was approximately $11 million. In December 2014, the Federal Reserve extended the conformance period for the Volcker Rule, which generally goes into effect on July 21, 2015, to give all banking entities until July 21, 2016 to conform their investments in, and relationships with, covered funds that were in place prior to December 31, 2013 (legacy covered funds). Moreover, the Federal Reserve also indicated its intent to grant an additional one-year extension of the conformance period for legacy covered funds in order to permit banking entities until July 21, 2017 to conform their ownership interests in, and relationships with, these funds. Substantially all of PNC\u2019s interests in covered funds qualify for the extended conformance period granted for holdings in legacy covered funds. Moreover, certain of PNC\u2019s legacy covered funds may qualify for an additional 5-year conformance period (i.e., until July 21, 2022), subject to Federal Reserve approval. It is likely that at least some of the amounts invested in legacy covered funds will reduce over time in the ordinary course before compliance is required. A forced sale or restructuring of PNC\u2019s investments due to the Volcker Rule would likely result in PNC receiving less value than it would otherwise have received or experiencing other adverse consequences.\n\u2022\nIn February 2014, the Federal Reserve issued final rules establishing new enhanced prudential standards relating to liquidity risk and overall risk management for BHCs (like PNC) that have $50 billion or more in consolidated total assets. The Federal Reserve, however, continues to develop the other enhanced prudential standards that are required under Dodd-Frank for bank holding companies with $50 billion or more in consolidated total assets, including the counterparty credit exposure limits and early remediation requirements that were the subject of proposed rules issued in December 2011. Under these proposed rules, PNC could be subject to increasingly stringent actions by the Federal Reserve if its financial condition or risk management deteriorated as reflected by the company\u2019s current or projected post-stress capital levels, compliance with supervisory liquidity and risk management standards and, in some instances, market-based indicators, such as credit default swap spreads. In addition, the\nFederal Reserve has indicated that it intends to continue to develop the set of enhanced prudential standards that apply to large bank holding companies in order to further promote the resiliency of such firms and the U.S. financial system. Until the Federal Reserve\u2019s rules and initiatives to establish these enhanced prudential standards are completed, we are unable to fully estimate their impact on PNC, although we expect these initiatives will result in increased compliance costs.\n\u2022\nIn October 2014, six federal agencies (the Federal Reserve, OCC, FDIC, SEC, Federal Housing Finance Agency and the Department of Housing and Urban Development) adopted final rules to implement the credit risk retention requirements of Section 941 of Dodd-Frank for asset-backed securitization transactions. The regulations specify when and how securitizers of different types of asset-backed securitizations, including transactions backed by residential mortgages, commercial mortgages, and commercial, credit card and auto loans, must comply with the Dodd-Frank requirement that they retain at least five percent of the credit risk of the assets being securitized. The final rules also implement the exemptions from these credit risk retention requirements for transactions that are backed by \u201cqualified residential mortgages\u201d or other high-quality commercial mortgage, commercial or automobile loans, each as defined in the final rules. The regulations will take effect on December 24, 2015 with respect to new securitization transactions backed by residential mortgages and on December 24, 2016 with respect to new securitization transactions backed by other types of assets. The final rules are likely to have an impact on PNC both directly as well as indirectly. The extent and magnitude of these impacts is not yet known and will, to some extent, depend on how the markets and market participants (including PNC) adjust to the new rules.\nOn the indirect impact side, PNC originates loans of a variety of types, including residential and commercial mortgages, credit card, auto, and student, that historically have commonly been securitized, and PNC is also a significant servicer of residential and commercial mortgages held by others, including securitization vehicles. PNC anticipates that the risk retention requirements will impact the market for loans of types that historically have been securitized, potentially affecting the volumes of loans securitized, the types of loan products made available, the terms on which loans are offered, consumer and business demand for loans, and the market for third-party loan servicers. The risk retention rules also could have the effect of slowing the rebound in the securitization markets. One effect of having substantially reduced\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. - Form 10-K 19\nopportunities to securitize loans would likely be a reduction in the willingness of banks, including PNC, to make loans due to balance sheet management requirements. Any of these potential impacts of the Dodd-Frank risk retention rules could affect the way in which PNC conducts its business, including its product offerings.\nEven after new rules are finalized and become effective, it still may take a period of time before the manner in which the rules will be interpreted and administered by the relevant agencies becomes clarified and known. A failure to comply, or to have adequate policies and procedures designed to comply, with these and other regulatory requirements could expose us to damages, fines and regulatory penalties and other regulatory actions, which could be significant, and could also injure our reputation with customers and others with whom we do business.\nNew capital and liquidity standards will result in banks and bank holding companies needing to maintain more and higher quality capital and greater liquidity than has historically been the case.\nWe are subject to regulatory capital and liquidity requirements established by the Federal Reserve and the OCC, and discuss these requirements and standards in the Supervision and Regulation section included in Item 1 of this Report.\nThe regulatory capital requirements applicable to banks and BHCs have undergone, and continue to undergo, significant changes. For example, the final rules adopted by the U.S. banking agencies in July 2013 to implement the new international guidelines for determining regulatory capital established by the Basel Committee known as \u201cBasel III\u201d, as well as to implement certain provisions of Dodd-Frank, fundamentally altered the U.S. regulatory capital requirements for U.S. BHCs and banks. Significant parts of these rules became effective for PNC on January 1, 2014 and on January 1, 2015, although as a result of the staggered effective dates of the rules many provisions are phased-in over a period of years, with the rules generally fully phased-in as of January 1, 2019. The Basel Committee, moreover, continues to consider additional, significant changes to the international capital framework for banking organizations, including modifications that would significantly alter the international frameworks governing the market risk capital requirements for trading positions and the standardized risk weighting approach for credit risk, establish a capital floor for banking organizations subject to the advanced approaches for the risk weighting of assets, modify the treatment of securitization positions, and seek to enhance the transparency and consistency of capital requirements amongst banks and jurisdictions. It is unclear how these or other initiatives by the Basel Committee may be finalized and implemented in the\nUnited States and, thus, we are unable to estimate what potential impact such initiatives may have on PNC.\nThe U.S. banking agencies also recently have implemented rules that significantly strengthen and alter the framework for liquidity regulation in the United States. In September 2014, the U.S. banking agencies adopted final rules to implement the LCR, a new, short-term quantitative liquidity requirement. These rules require PNC and PNC Bank to maintain an amount of qualifying high-quality liquid assets sufficient to cover the entity\u2019s projected net cash outflows over a 30-day stress period using inflow, outflow and maturity assumptions included in the rule. The LCR rules became effective for PNC and PNC Bank on January 1, 2015, and the minimum required LCR and the requirement to calculate the LCR on a daily basis will be phased-in over a period of years, with the standard being fully implemented on January 1, 2017. In anticipation of the final rules, PNC undertook several actions to prepare for implementation of the LCR. The Federal Reserve\u2019s new liquidity risk management requirements for bank holding companies with $50 billion or more in consolidated total assets (like PNC) also became effective on January 1, 2015. The new rules require covered BHCs to, among other things, conduct internal liquidity stress tests over a range of time horizons, maintain a buffer of highly liquid assets sufficient to meet projected net outflows under the BHC\u2019s 30-day liquidity stress test, and maintain a contingency funding plan that meets detailed requirements.\nAdditional liquidity standards also are expected to be implemented in the coming years. For example, the Basel Committee, in October 2014, released the final framework for the NSFR standard, which is designed to ensure that banking organizations maintain a stable, long-term funding profile in relation to their asset composition and off-balance sheet activities. Under that framework, the NSFR would take effect as a minimum regulatory standard on January 1, 2018, although the U.S. banking agencies have not yet proposed rules to implement the NSFR.\nThe need to maintain more and higher quality capital, as well as greater liquidity, going forward than historically has been required could limit PNC\u2019s business activities, including lending, and its ability to expand, either organically or through acquisitions. It could also result in PNC taking steps to increase its capital that may be dilutive to shareholders or being limited in its ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders, or selling or refraining from acquiring assets, the capital requirements for which are inconsistent with the assets\u2019 underlying risks. In addition, the new liquidity standards require PNC to maintain holdings of highly liquid short-term investments, thereby reducing PNC\u2019s ability to invest in longer-term or less liquid assets even if more desirable from a balance sheet or interest rate risk management perspective. Moreover, although these new requirements are being phased in over time, U.S. federal\n20 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. - Form 10-K\nbanking agencies have been taking into account expectations regarding the ability of banks to meet these new requirements, including under stressed conditions, in approving actions that represent uses of capital, such as dividend increases, share repurchases and acquisitions. Moreover, PNC, as a BHC that is subject to the advanced approaches for regulatory capital purposes, is subject to a higher LCR requirement than other BHCs that have more than $50 billion in total assets but are not subject to the advanced approaches. Until the scope and terms of pending or future rulemakings relating to capital, liquidity, or liability composition are known, the extent to which such rules may apply to PNC and the potential impact of such rules on PNC will remain uncertain.\nWe depend on information systems, both internally and through third-parties, to conduct our business and could suffer a material adverse impact from interruptions in the effective operation of, or security breaches affecting, those systems.\nAs a large financial company, we handle a substantial volume of customer and other financial transactions virtually on a continuous basis. As a result, we rely heavily on information systems to conduct our business and to process, record, and monitor our transactions. In recent years, PNC has increased substantially in size, scope and complexity. We have also seen more customer usage of technological solutions for financial needs and higher expectations of customers and regulators regarding effective and safe systems operation. We expect these trends to continue for the foreseeable future. The need to ensure proper functioning of these systems has become more challenging, and the costs involved in that effort are greater than ever.\nThe risks to these systems result from a variety of factors, both internal and external. In some cases, these factors are largely outside of our control, including the potential for bad acts on the part of hackers, criminals, employees and others. In other cases, our systems could fail to operate as needed due to factors such as design or performance issues, human error, unexpected transaction volumes, or inadequate measures to protect against unauthorized access or transmissions. We are also at risk for the impact of natural or other disasters, terrorism, international hostilities and the like on our systems or for the effect of outages or other failures involving power or communications systems operated by others. In addition, we face a variety of types of cyber attacks, some of which are discussed in more detail below. Cyber attacks often include efforts to disrupt our ability to provide services or to gain access to confidential company and customer information.\nWe rely on other companies for the provision of a broad range of products and services. Many of these products and services include information systems themselves or involve the use of such systems in connection with providing the products or services. In some cases, these other companies provide the infrastructure that supports electronic communications. These\nother companies are generally subject to many of the same risks we face with respect to our systems. To the extent we rely on these other companies, we could be adversely affected if they are impacted by system failures, cyber attacks or employee misconduct.\nAll of these types of events, whether resulting from cyber attacks or other internal or external sources, expose customer and other confidential information to security risks. They also could disrupt our ability to use our accounting, deposit, loan and other systems and could cause errors in transactions with customers, vendors or other counterparties.\nIn addition, our customers often use their own devices, such as computers, smartphones and tablets, to do business with us. We have limited ability to assure the safety and security of our customers\u2019 transactions with us to the extent they are utilizing their own devices.\nWe are faced with ongoing efforts by others to breach data security at financial institutions or with respect to financial transactions. Some of these involve efforts to enter our systems directly by going through or around our security protections. Others involve the use of schemes such as \u201cphishing\u201d to gain access to identifying customer information, often from customers themselves. Most corporate and commercial transactions are now handled electronically, and our retail customers increasingly use online access and mobile devices to bank with us. The ability to conduct business with us in this manner depends on the transmission of confidential information, which increases the risk of data security breaches.\nStarting in late 2012, there have been several well-publicized series of apparently related denial of service attacks on large financial services companies, including PNC. In a denial of service attack, individuals or organizations flood commercial websites with extraordinarily high volumes of traffic, with the goal of disrupting the ability of commercial enterprises to process transactions and possibly making their websites unavailable to customers for extended periods of time. The attacks against PNC have resulted in temporary disruptions in customers\u2019 ability to access the corporate website and to perform on-line banking transactions. To date, no customer data has been lost or compromised as a result of these attacks and these efforts have not had a material impact on PNC. We cannot, however, provide assurance that future attacks of this type might not have a greater effect on PNC.\nAs our customers regularly use PNC-issued credit and debit cards to pay for transactions with retailers and other businesses, there is the risk of data security breaches at those other businesses covering PNC account information. When our customers use PNC-issued cards to make purchases from those businesses, card account information may be provided to the business. If the business\u2019s systems that process or store card account information are subject to a data security breach,\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. - Form 10-K 21\nholders of our cards who have made purchases from that business may experience fraud on their card accounts. PNC may suffer losses associated with reimbursing our customers for such fraudulent transactions on customers\u2019 card accounts, as well as for other costs related to data security compromise events, such as replacing cards associated with compromised card accounts. In addition, PNC provides card transaction processing services to some merchant customers under agreements we have with payment networks such as Visa and MasterCard. Under these agreements, we may be responsible for certain losses and penalties if one of our merchant customers suffers a data security breach.\nOver the last several years, several large retailers, prominently including Target and Home Depot, disclosed that they had suffered substantial data security breaches compromising millions of card accounts. To date, PNC\u2019s losses and costs related to these breaches have not been material, but other similar events in the future could be more significant to PNC.\nThere have been other recent publicly announced cyber attacks that were not focused on gaining access to credit card information but instead sought access to a range of other types of confidential information including internal emails and other forms of customer financial information or sought to capture and possibly shutdown systems and devices maintained by target companies. Notable examples include attacks in 2014 on JP Morgan Chase and Sony Pictures and in early 2015 on Anthem. These other attacks have generally not had any financial impact on PNC but demonstrate the risks to confidential information and systems operations potentially posed by cyber attacks.\nMethods used by others to attack information systems change frequently (with generally increasing sophistication), often are not recognized until launched against a target, may be supported by foreign governments or other well-financed entities, and may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world. As a result, we may be unable to address these methods in advance of attacks, including by implementing adequate preventive measures.\nWe have policies, procedures and systems (including business continuity programs) designed to prevent or limit the effect of possible failures, interruptions or breaches in security of information systems. We design our business continuity and other information and technology risk management programs to manage our capabilities to provide services in the case of an event resulting in material disruptions of business activities affecting our employees, facilities, technology or suppliers. We regularly seek to test the effectiveness of and enhance these policies, procedures and systems.\nOur ability to mitigate the adverse consequences of such occurrences is in part dependent on the quality of our business continuity planning and our ability to anticipate the timing and nature of any such event that occurs. The adverse impact of\nnatural and other disasters, terrorist activities, international hostilities and the like could be increased to the extent that there is a lack of preparedness on the part of national or regional governments, including emergency responders, or on the part of other organizations and businesses with which we deal, particularly those on which we depend but have no control over.\nIn recent years, we have incurred significant expense towards improving the reliability of our systems and their security against external and internal threats. Nonetheless, there remains the risk that an adverse event might occur. If one does occur, we might not be able to remediate the event or its consequences timely or adequately. To the extent that the risk relates to products or services provided by others, we seek to engage in due diligence and monitoring to limit the risk, but here as well we cannot eliminate it. Should an adverse event affecting another company\u2019s systems occur, we may not have indemnification or other protection from the other company sufficient to compensate us or otherwise protect us from the consequences.\nThe occurrence of any failure, interruption or security breach of any of our information or communications systems, or the systems of other companies on which we rely, could result in a wide variety of adverse consequences to PNC. This risk is greater if the issue is widespread or results in financial losses to our customers. Possible adverse consequences include damage to our reputation or a loss of customer business. We also could face litigation or additional regulatory scrutiny. Litigation or regulatory actions in turn could lead to liability or other sanctions, including fines and penalties or reimbursement of customers adversely affected by a systems problem or security breach. Even if we do not suffer any material adverse consequences as a result of events affecting us directly, successful attacks or systems failures at other financial institutions could lead to a general loss of customer confidence in financial institutions, including PNC. Also, systems problems, including those resulting from third party attacks, whether at PNC or at our competitors, would likely increase regulatory and customer concerns regarding the functioning, safety and security of such systems generally. In that case, we would expect to incur even higher levels of costs with respect to prevention and mitigation of these risks.\nWe continually encounter technological change and we could falter in our ability to remain competitive in this arena.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. We have been investing in technology and connectivity to automate functions previously performed manually, to facilitate the ability of customers to engage in financial\n22 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. - Form 10-K\ntransactions, and otherwise to enhance the customer experience with respect to our products and services. On the retail side, this has included developments such as more sophisticated ATMs and expanded access to banking transactions through the internet, smart phones, tablets and other remote devices. These efforts have all been in response to actual and anticipated customer behavior and expectations. Our continued success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that satisfy customer demands and create efficiencies in our operations. A failure to maintain or enhance our competitive position with respect to technology, whether because we fail to anticipate customer expectations or because our technological developments fail to perform as desired or are not rolled out in a timely manner, may cause us to lose market share or incur additional expense.\nThere are risks resulting from the extensive use of models in our business.\nPNC relies on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values. Models may be used in such processes as determining the pricing of various products, grading loans and extending credit, measuring interest rate and other market risks, predicting losses, assessing capital adequacy, and calculating economic and regulatory capital levels, as well as to estimate the value of financial instruments and balance sheet items. Poorly designed or implemented models present the risk that our business decisions based on information incorporating models will be adversely affected due to the inadequacy of that information. Also, information we provide to the public or to our regulators based on poorly designed or implemented models could be inaccurate or misleading. Some of the decisions that our regulators make, including those related to capital distributions to our shareholders, could be affected adversely due to their perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient. See the Model Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section included in Item 7 of this Report.\nOur asset and liability valuations and the determination of the amount of loss allowances and impairments taken on our assets are highly subjective, and inaccurate estimates could materially impact our results of operations or financial position.\nWe must use estimates, assumptions, and judgments when assets and liabilities are measured and reported at fair value. Assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility. Changes in underlying factors or assumptions in any of the areas underlying our estimates could materially impact our future financial condition and results of operations. During periods of market disruption, it may be more difficult to value certain of our assets if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. There may be certain asset\nclasses that were historically in active markets with significant observable data that rapidly become illiquid due to market volatility, a loss in market confidence or other factors. Further, rapidly changing and unprecedented market conditions in any particular market could materially impact the valuation of assets as reported within our consolidated financial statements.\nThe determination of the amount of loss allowances and asset impairments varies by asset type and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Management updates its evaluations regularly and reflects changes in allowances and impairments in operations as such evaluations are revised. Although we have policies and procedures in place to determine loss allowance and asset impairments, due to the substantial subjective nature of this area, there can be no assurance that our management has accurately assessed the level of impairments taken and allowances reflected in our financial statements. Furthermore, additional impairments may need to be taken or allowances provided for in the future. Historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments or allowances.\nOur business and financial results could be impacted materially by adverse results in legal proceedings.\nMany aspects of our business involve substantial risk of legal liability. We have been named or threatened to be named as defendants in various lawsuits arising from our business activities (and in some cases from the activities of companies we have acquired). In addition, we are regularly the subject of governmental investigations and other forms of regulatory inquiry. We also are at risk when we have agreed to indemnify others for losses related to legal proceedings, including litigation and governmental investigations and inquiries, they face, such as in connection with the sale of a business or assets by us. The results of these legal proceedings could lead to significant monetary damages or penalties, restrictions on the way in which we conduct our business, or reputational harm.\nAlthough we establish accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, we do not have accruals for all legal proceedings where we face a risk of loss. In addition, due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings, amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to us from the legal proceedings in question. Thus, our ultimate losses may be higher, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies.\nWe discuss further the unpredictability of legal proceedings and describe certain of our pending legal proceedings in Note 21 Legal Proceedings in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report.\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. - Form 10-K 23\nPNC faces legal and regulatory risk arising out of its residential mortgage businesses.\nNumerous federal and state governmental, legislative and regulatory authorities are investigating practices in the business of mortgage and home equity loan lending and servicing and in the mortgage-related insurance and reinsurance industries. PNC has received inquiries from governmental, legislative and regulatory authorities on these topics and is responding to these inquiries. These inquiries and investigations could lead to administrative, civil or criminal proceedings, possibly resulting in remedies including fines, penalties, restitution, alterations in our business practices and additional expenses and collateral costs. They could also result in reputational harm to PNC, either individually or as part of the overall industry, regardless of the extent to which PNC is penalized.\nIn addition to governmental or regulatory inquiries and investigations, PNC, like other companies with residential mortgage and home equity loan origination and servicing operations, faces the risk of class actions, other litigation and claims from: the owners of, investors in, or purchasers of such loans originated or serviced by PNC (or securities backed by such loans), homeowners involved in foreclosure proceedings or various mortgage-related insurance programs, downstream purchasers of homes sold after foreclosure, title insurers, and other potential claimants. Included among these claims are claims from purchasers of mortgage and home equity loans seeking the repurchase of loans where the loans allegedly breached origination covenants and representations and warranties made to the purchasers in the purchase and sale agreements.\nAt this time PNC cannot predict the ultimate overall cost to or effect upon PNC from governmental, legislative or regulatory actions and private litigation or claims arising out of residential mortgage and home equity loan lending, servicing or reinsurance practices, although such actions, litigation and claims could, individually or in the aggregate, result in significant expense. See Note 21 Legal Proceedings and Note 22 Commitments and Guarantees in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information regarding federal and state governmental, legislative and regulatory inquiries and investigations and additional information regarding potential repurchase obligations relating to mortgage and home equity loans.\nThere is a continuing risk of incurring costs related to further remedial and related efforts required by governmental or regulatory authorities and related to repurchase requests arising out of either the foreclosure process or origination issues. Reputational damage arising out of this industry-wide inquiry could also have an adverse effect upon our existing mortgage and home equity loan business and could reduce future business opportunities. Investors in mortgage loans and\nother assets that we sell are more likely to seek indemnification from us against losses or otherwise seek to have us share in such losses.\nThe CFPB has issued new rules for mortgage origination and mortgage servicing. Both the origination and servicing rules create new private rights of action for consumers against lenders and servicers like PNC in the event of certain violations. For additional information concerning the mortgage rules, see Supervision and Regulation in Item 1 of this Report.\nAdditionally, two government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) (FHLMC and FNMA) are currently in conservatorship, with its primary regulator acting as a conservator. We cannot predict when or if the conservatorships will end or whether, as a result of legislative or regulatory action, there will be any associated changes to the structure of these GSEs or the housing finance industry more generally, including, but not limited to, changes to the relationship among these GSEs, the government and the private markets. The effects of any such reform on our business and financial results are uncertain.\nOur regional concentrations make us at risk to adverse economic conditions in our primary retail banking footprint.\nOur retail banking business is primarily concentrated within our retail branch network footprint. Although our other businesses are national in scope, to a lesser extent these other businesses also have a greater presence within these primary geographic markets. Thus, we are particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions in the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, and Southeast regions.\nWe grow our business in part by acquiring other financial services companies or assets from time to time, and these acquisitions present a number of risks and uncertainties related both to the acquisition transactions themselves and to the integration of the acquired businesses into PNC after closing.\nAcquisitions of other financial services companies, financial assets and related deposits and other liabilities present risks and uncertainties to PNC in addition to those presented by the nature of the business acquired.\nIn general, acquisitions may be substantially more expensive or take longer to complete than anticipated (including unanticipated costs incurred in connection with the integration of the acquired company). Anticipated benefits (including anticipated cost savings and strategic gains, for example resulting from being able to offer product sets to a broader potential customer base) may be significantly harder or take longer to achieve than expected or may not be achieved in their entirety as a result of unexpected factors or events.\n24 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. - Form 10-K\nOur ability to achieve anticipated results from acquisitions is often dependent also on the extent of credit losses in the acquired loan portfolios and the extent of deposit attrition, which are, in part, related to the state of economic and financial markets.\nAlso, litigation and governmental investigations that may be pending at the time of the acquisition or be filed or commenced thereafter, as a result of an acquisition or otherwise, could impact the timing or realization of anticipated benefits to PNC. Note 21 Legal Proceedings in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Report describes several legal proceedings related to pre-acquisition activities of companies we have acquired, including National City. Other such legal proceedings may be commenced in the future.\nIntegration of an acquired company\u2019s business and operations into PNC, including conversion of the acquired company\u2019s different systems and procedures, may take longer than anticipated or be more costly than anticipated or have unanticipated adverse results relating to the acquired company\u2019s or PNC\u2019s existing businesses. In some cases, acquisitions involve our entry into new businesses or new geographic or other markets, and these situations also present risks and uncertainties in instances where we may be inexperienced in these new areas.\nOur ability to analyze the risks presented by prospective acquisitions, as well as our ability to prepare in advance of closing for integration, depends, in part, on the information we can gather with respect to the target, which is more limited than the information we have regarding companies we already own.\nAs a regulated financial institution, our ability to pursue or complete attractive acquisition opportunities could be negatively impacted by regulatory delays or other regulatory issues. In addition, our ability to make large acquisitions in the future may be negatively impacted by regulatory rules or future regulatory initiatives designed to limit the potential for a financial institution to become \u201ctoo big to fail.\u201d\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment, in terms of the products and services we offer and the geographic markets in which we conduct business, as well as in our labor markets where we compete for talented employees. Competition could adversely impact our customer acquisition, growth and retention, as well as our credit spreads and product pricing, causing us to lose market share and deposits and revenues.\nWe are subject to intense competition from various financial institutions as well as from non-bank entities that engage in many similar activities without being subject to bank regulatory supervision and restrictions. This competition is described in Item 1 of this Report under \u201cCompetition.\u201d\nCompetition in our industry could intensify as a result of the increasing consolidation of financial services companies, in connection with current market conditions or otherwise.\nIn all, the principal bases for competition are pricing (including the interest rates charged on loans or paid on interest-bearing deposits), product structure, the range of products and services offered, and the quality of customer service (including convenience and responsiveness to customer needs and concerns). The ability to access and use technology is an increasingly important competitive factor in the financial services industry, and it is a critically important component to customer satisfaction as it affects our ability to deliver the right products and services.\nAnother increasingly competitive factor in the financial services industry is the competition to attract and retain talented employees across many of our business and support areas. This competition leads to increased expenses in many business areas and can also cause us to not pursue certain business opportunities. Limitations on the manner in which regulated financial institutions can compensate their officers and employees may make it more difficult for regulated financial institutions to compete with unregulated financial institutions for talent.\nA failure to adequately address the competitive pressures we face could make it harder for us to attract and retain customers across our businesses. On the other hand, meeting these competitive pressures could require us to incur significant additional expense or to accept risk beyond what we would otherwise view as desirable under the circumstances. In addition, in our interest rate sensitive businesses, pressures to increase rates on deposits or decrease rates on loans could reduce our net interest margin with a resulting negative impact on our net interest income.\nOur business and financial performance could be adversely affected, directly or indirectly, by disasters, natural or otherwise, by terrorist activities or by international hostilities.\nNeither the occurrence nor the potential impact of disasters (such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods and other severe weather conditions, pandemics, dislocations, fires, explosions, and other catastrophic accidents or events), terrorist activities and international hostilities can be predicted. However, these occurrences could impact us directly (for example, by causing significant damage to our facilities or preventing us from conducting our business in the ordinary course), or indirectly as a result of their impact on our borrowers, depositors, other customers, suppliers or other counterparties. We could also suffer adverse consequences to the extent that disasters, terrorist activities or international hostilities affect the financial markets or the economy in general or in any particular region. These types of impacts could lead, for example, to an increase in delinquencies,\nThe PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. - Form 10-K 25\nbankruptcies or defaults that could result in our experiencing higher levels of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and provisions for credit losses.\nOur ability to mitigate the adverse consequences of such occurrences is in part dependent on the quality of our resiliency planning, and our ability, if any, to anticipate the nature of any such event that occurs. The adverse impact of disasters or terrorist activities or international hostilities also could be increased to the extent that there is a lack of preparedness on the part of national or regional emergency responders or on the part of other organizations and businesses that we deal with, particularly those that we depend upon but have no control over.", "PERMNO": 60442, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "PNC"}
