{"cik": "278041", "company": "INTERNATIONAL SHIPHOLDING CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-12", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following discussion of \u201crisk factors\u201d identifies the most significant risks or uncertainties that could (i) materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or prospects or (ii) cause our actual results to differ materially from our anticipated results or other expectations. The following information should be read in conjunction with \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation\u201d and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this report. Please note that the following discussion is not intended to comprehensively list all risks or uncertainties faced by us. Our operations or actual results could also be similarly impacted by additional risks and uncertainties that (i) are not currently known to us, (ii) we currently deem to be immaterial or (iii) are not specific to us or our industry, such as general economic conditions.\nOur industry is cyclical and has experienced a recent decline in the demand for certain of the services we offer, which could negatively impact our revenues and earnings.\nHistorically, the shipping industry has been cyclical. The nature, timing and degree of changes to industry conditions are generally unpredictable and are impacted by factors beyond our control. Various factors influence the demand for our transportation services, including changes in (i) worldwide demand for the commercial products we carry, (ii) the volume of cargoes we carry for or the amount of services we provide to the U.S. government, (iii) political and regulatory conditions domestically and internationally, and (iv) the supply and demand for vessels. The worldwide supply of vessels generally increases with deliveries of new, refurbished or converted vessels and decreases with the scrapping of older vessels. If the available supply of vessels exceeds the number of vessels being scrapped, vessel capacity and competition in the markets where we operate may increase. In the absence of a corresponding increase in the demand for these vessels, the time charter hire and cargo rates for our vessels could fluctuate significantly and result in, among other things, lower operating revenues, earnings and asset values.\nOur operating results for any particular period can vary significantly based on the amount of supplemental cargoes we carry during that period, which is completely outside of our control. During periods of high supplemental cargoes, such as 2008 and 2009, we benefit significantly from the additional utilization of our vessels to carry these supplemental cargoes. Conversely, during periods of low supplemental cargoes, such as 2014, our operating results are adversely affected. Due to the inherent variability of these supplemental cargoes, we cannot predict the revenues or profits attributable to any supplemental cargo that we may carry for any particular future period.\nWe may not be able to renew our time charters and contracts when they expire at favorable rates or at all.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, we received approximately 77% of our revenue from time charters and other fixed contracts. However, there can be no assurance that any of these charters or contracts, which are generally for periods of one year or more, will be renewed.\nMoreover, you should be aware that shipping rates are based on several factors that are unpredictable and beyond our control. Accordingly, even if we are able to renew our charters or other fixed contracts when they lapse, we may not be able to earn rates or carry volumes comparable to those received under the expired charters or contracts, which would adversely affect our revenues, earnings and cash flows. In the event we cannot deploy a vessel at economically viable rates, we may opt to lay up the vessel until such time that spot or charter rates become attractive again. During the period of lay-up, the vessel will continue to incur expenditures such as insurance and maintenance costs.\nFrom time to time, we enter into charter agreements with various agencies or departments of the U.S. government that allow the customer to terminate the agreement at any time without cause, subject to the payment of certain early termination fees. Under\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ncertain circumstances, the federal government can suspend or terminate our eligibility to provide additional future services to the federal government.\nIf our exposure to the spot market increases, our revenues could suffer and our expenses could increase.\nAt December 31, 2014, we deployed 23% of our vessels in the spot market, where rates are typically volatile and subject to short-term market fluctuations. The spot market for marine transportation services is highly competitive, and charter rates for most dry cargo vessels in the spot market are currently low in relation to historical rates. If we deploy a greater percentage of our vessels in the spot market, we may experience a lower overall utilization of our fleet through waiting time or ballast voyages, leading to a decline in our operating revenue and gross profit and an increased risk that we will be unable to recoup our investment in those vessels.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry.\nThe shipping industry is intensely competitive and can be influenced by economic and political events that are largely outside the control of shipping companies. In each of our principal markets, we face competition from a wide variety of marine transportation companies that operate a diverse group of vessels. In addition, our Rail-Ferry and Jones Act operations face current or potential competition from land-based transportation companies.\nMany of our current and potential competitors:\n\u00b7\nmay have greater resources or stronger brands than we have;\n\u00b7\nown larger and more diverse fleets of vessels;\n\u00b7\nconduct operations or raise capital at lower costs than us; or\n\u00b7\nmay be better positioned to adapt to changes in market or economic conditions.\nChanges in the political or regulatory environment can also create competition that is not necessarily based on normal considerations of profit and loss. Consequently, there can be no assurance that we will be able to deploy our vessels on economically attractive terms, maintain attractive freight rates, pass cost increases through to our customers or otherwise successfully compete against our competitors. Any failure to remain competitive in the shipping industry could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nCompetition could adversely impact us in several ways, including (i) the loss of customers and market share, (ii) the possibility of customers reducing their usage of our vessels or services, (iii) our need to expend substantial time or money on vessel acquisitions or capital improvement projects, (iv) our need to lower prices or increase marketing expenses to remain competitive, (v) our need to sell vessels to cover our fixed commitments, and (vi) our inability to diversify by successfully offering new marine transportation services.\nA significant amount of our revenues were derived from four customers, and our revenues could decrease significantly if these customers were lost or their revenues decreased.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013, and 2014, we derived 41%, 27%, and 14% of our revenues from contracts with various agencies or departments of the U.S. government. Likewise, we derived 15%, 13%, and 13% of our revenues for the same periods, respectively, from contracts with a Japanese shipping company. Additionally, we derived 21% and 26% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014, respectively, from contracts with two major U.S. corporations. We are unable to assure you that these customers will continue to contract with us on similar terms, or will not decide to contract with our competitors or perform their own shipping functions themselves. Our inability or failure to continue to retain these customer relationships, to continue to employ our vessels at rates comparable to those historically earned from these customers, or to charter these vessels otherwise in a reasonable period of time or at all could adversely affect our operations and performance. Specifically, in recent periods, Congress has reduced levels of the U.S. government\u2019s discretionary spending on a wide range of programs, including \u201csequestration\u201d spending reductions scheduled to occur annually between 2013 and 2021. Future additional cuts in discretionary spending could adversely affect our revenue derived from the U.S. government.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe cannot assure you that quarterly dividends on, or any other payments in respect of, our outstanding capital stock will be made timely or at all.\nFor the reasons noted below, we cannot assure you that we will pay timely quarterly dividends on our common stock at the current rate or at all. Likewise, we cannot assure you that we will pay quarterly dividends on, or make other payments in respect of, our Series A and Series B Preferred Shares timely or at all.\nBecause we are a holding company with no material assets other than the stock of our subsidiaries, our ability to pay dividends will depend on the earnings and cash flow of our subsidiaries and their ability to furnish funds to us in the form of dividends, loans or other payments.\nWe currently have outstanding 250,000 shares of our 9.50% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock and 316,250 shares of our 9.00% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock. Subject to limited exceptions, no dividends may be declared or paid with respect to our common stock unless (i) full cumulative dividends have been or contemporaneously are paid on all of our outstanding Series A and Series B Preferred Shares through the most recent dividend payment dates applicable to each such series and (ii) we are in compliance with a net worth to preferred stock ratio applicable to both such series.\nAny quarterly dividends on our common stock and our Series A and Series B Preferred Shares will be paid from funds legally available for such purpose when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors. You should be aware that certain factors may influence our decision, or adversely affect our ability, to pay dividends on our common stock or our Series A and Series B Preferred Shares, including, among other things:\n\u00b7\nour supply of cash or other liquid assets might decrease for any of the reasons described in this report, including (i) due to changes in competition, regulation, vessel rates, fleet deployment, taxes, capital markets, operating or drydock costs, or litigation expense or (ii) the impact of any liquidity shortfalls caused by the below-described restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to lawfully transfer cash to us;\n\u00b7\nany of the events described in this report that impact our future financial position or performance, including changes in vessel deployment or vessel rates, changes in our costs, the number of unscheduled off-hire days for our fleet, the number of days required for dry-docking of our vessels, prevailing global and regional economic and political conditions, and the effect of governmental regulations and maritime self-regulatory organization standards on the conduct of our business;\n\u00b7\nour cash requirements or plans might change for a wide variety of reasons, including changes in our capital allocation plans (including a desire to retain or accumulate cash), capital spending plans, stock purchase plans, acquisition strategies, strategic initiatives, debt payment plans, pension funding requirements or plans, or financial position;\n\u00b7\nour ability to service and refinance our current and future indebtedness and our ability to borrow or raise additional capital to satisfy our capital needs;\n\u00b7\nrestrictions imposed by our existing or future credit facilities, debt securities, preferred stock securities (including those referred to above), leases, or other agreements, including restricted payment and leverage covenants;\n\u00b7\nthe amount of cash that our subsidiaries may make available to us, whether by dividends, loans or other payments, may be subject to (i) restrictions imposed by the law of the respective jurisdictions of organization of such subsidiaries and (ii) restrictions imposed pursuant to existing or future credit facilities, debt or equity securities, leases, or other agreements applicable to such subsidiaries; and\n\u00b7\nlimitations on cash payments to stockholders under Delaware law, including limitations that require dividend payments be made out of surplus or, subject to certain limitations, out of net profits for the then-current or preceding year in the event there is no surplus.\nBased on its evaluation of these and other relevant factors, our Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion, decide not to declare a dividend on our common stock or our Series A or B Preferred Shares for any quarterly period for any reason, regardless of whether we have funds legally available for such purposes. Holders of our equity securities should be aware that they have no contractual or other legal right to receive dividends.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe cannot assure that we will be able to comply with all of our loan covenants.\nAll of our credit agreements and several of our lease agreements impose restrictions or limitations on our business and require us to comply with various loan covenants. The restrictions or limitations these covenants place on us include limitations on our ability to freely: (i) consolidate or merge; (ii) incur new or certain types of debt; (iii) engage in transactions with affiliates; (iv) create liens or permit them to exist on our assets; (v) sell certain assets; (vi) enter into sales and leaseback transactions; and (vii) directly invest in assets other than vessels. These covenants may prevent us from engaging in transactions that otherwise might be considered beneficial to us and our stockholders.\nIn addition, all of our credit agreements and several of our lease agreements include financial covenants that stipulate minimum levels of net worth, working capital, liquidity and maximum levels of debt and debt leverage. Our ability to satisfy these and other covenants depends on our results of operations and ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions. Our ability to respond to such changes may be beyond our control or may be significantly restricted by contractual or other limitations. Failure to satisfy any of these financial covenants could cause us to suffer an event of default, which could, among other things, accelerate our obligations under any such agreement or preclude us from making future borrowings thereunder.\nMoreover, because our debt obligations are represented by separate agreements with different lenders, in some cases any breach of these covenants or any other default under one agreement may create an event of default under other agreements, resulting in the acceleration of our obligation to pay principal, interest and potential penalties under such other agreements (even though we may otherwise be in compliance with all of our obligations under those agreements). Thus, an event of default under a single agreement, including one that is technical in nature or otherwise not material, could result in the acceleration of significant indebtedness under multiple lending agreements. If amounts outstanding under such agreements were to be accelerated, there can be no assurance that (i) we would be able to obtain additional sources of cash to repay the accelerated indebtedness, (ii) our assets or operations would generate sufficient cash proceeds or cash flow to repay such accelerated indebtedness, or (iii) our lenders would not proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness. Likewise, an event of default under one of these agreements could also prevent us from being able to access our revolving credit facility or other debt agreements for future borrowings. The acceleration of any or all amounts due under these agreements or the loss of the ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility or other debt agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with all of our financial or other loan covenants. As discussed further in Item 7 of Part II of this report under \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d, we successfully approached our principal senior secured lenders and lessors during 2014 to solicit their agreement to amend our financial covenants. The agreement of our lenders and lessors to these amendments, containing less stringent ratios, permitted us to remain in compliance with our covenants through the end of 2014 and a portion of 2015.\nIf we default under our credit agreements or certain of our principal lease agreements, we could be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, obtain additional capital, enter into financings of our unencumbered vessels, restructure debt, modify our current business plan, or curtail certain of our operations. We cannot assure you that we will be able to implement these options timely or at all, or that they will enable us to meet all of our covenants currently in effect.\nFor further detailed information on our compliance with our financial covenants as of December 31, 2014, please see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d in Item 7 of Part II of this report.\nMarine transportation is inherently risky, and insurance may be insufficient to cover losses that may occur to our assets or result from our operations.\nThe operations of our vessels are subject to various inherent risks, including:\n\u00b7\ncatastrophic marine disaster;\n\u00b7\nadverse weather conditions or natural disasters;\n\u00b7\nmechanical failure;\n\u00b7\ncollisions;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u00b7\nhazardous substance spills;\n\u00b7\nseizure or expropriation of our vessels by governments, pirates, combatants or others; and\n\u00b7\nnavigation and human errors.\nThe occurrence of any of these events may result in, among other things, damage to or loss of our vessels and our vessels\u2019 cargo or other property, delays in delivery of cargo, damage to other vessels and the environment, loss of revenues, termination of vessel charters or other contracts, fines, penalties or other restrictions on conducting business, damage to our reputation and customer relationships, and injury to personnel. Such occurrences may also result in a significant increase in our operating costs or liability to third parties.\nAlthough we maintain insurance coverage against most of these risks at levels our management considers to be customary in the industry, risks may arise for which we are not adequately insured. Various claims, such as claims for business interruption, may not be covered by our policies. Additionally, any particular claim may be subject to deductibles or other coverage restrictions, the aggregate impact of which could be material. We cannot assure you that we will be able to renew our existing insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates or that insurance will remain available at reasonable rates for each of our foreseeable risks that we seek to insure, especially those relating to terrorism or piracy. Similarly, we cannot assure you that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover future claims as they arise, or that available insurance will cover all foreseeable risks, particularly those involving catastrophic environmental liability. Any uninsured or underinsured loss could have an adverse effect on our financial performance or condition.\nAdditionally, certain of our insurance coverage is maintained through mutual \u201cprotection and indemnity\u201d associations, which are mutual insurance clubs whose members must contribute payments to cover losses sustained by other club members. As a member of such associations, we routinely pay premiums to fund liability reserves, and may be required to make additional payments to the extent member claims would surpass the reserves of the association. We may be subject to calls or premiums in amounts based not only on our own claim records, but also the claim records of all other members (or the members of affiliated clubs) over which we have no control. Our payment of these calls could result in significant additional expenses. In addition, we cannot assure you that other association members called upon to pay our claims will be able to do so, particularly since the exposure to such calls would be concentrated among a limited number of shipping companies likely facing the same types of risks as ours.\nNegative publicity may adversely impact us.\nAccidents involving any vessels operated by us could cause substantial adverse publicity affecting us specifically or our industry generally. In either case, media coverage and public statements that insinuate improper actions by us, regardless of their factual accuracy or truthfulness, may result in negative publicity, litigation, governmental investigations or additional regulations. Addressing negative publicity and any resulting litigation or investigations may distract management, increase costs and divert resources. Negative publicity may have an adverse impact on our reputation and the morale of our employees, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nEconomic conditions, a prolonged economic downturn, economic uncertainty, an increase in trade protectionism or a change in trade patterns in the markets where we operate may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe demand for our transportation services has been and will continue to be affected by domestic and global economic conditions. Worldwide economic growth has been sluggish since 2008, which has contributed to lower charter rates for marine transportation services since then. Many experts believe that a confluence of worldwide factors could result in a prolonged period of economic downturn, slow growth or economic uncertainty. If these conditions persist, our customers and potential customers may experience deterioration in their business, which may result in a lower demand for our transportation services or impair the ability of our customers or other third parties to pay amounts owed to us. Moreover, our business, financial condition, results of operations, ability to pay dividends and our future prospects will likely be materially and adversely affected by a prolonged economic downturn impacting our markets.\nThe demand for our transportation services is also exposed to the risk that increases in trade protectionism or changes in trade patterns will adversely affect our business. If global economic conditions remain slack and uncertain, governments may turn to trade barriers to protect their domestic industries against foreign imports, thereby depressing the demand for shipping. Similarly, if changes in production costs or other factors cause manufacturing companies to locate a greater share of their production facilities nearer to\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ntheir consumers, then demand for our shipping services could be further depressed. Either of these could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, ability to pay dividends and future prospects.\nIf Congress does not make sufficient appropriations under the National Defense Authorization Act for any Fiscal Year, we may not continue to receive certain payments.\nIf Congress does not make sufficient appropriations under the National Defense Authorization Act for any fiscal year, we may not continue to receive annual payments with respect to certain of our U.S. Flag vessels that we have committed to the federal government under the U.S. Maritime Security Program. Under this program, which is currently in effect through 2025, each participating vessel is currently scheduled to receive annual payments of $3.1 million. As of December 31, 2014, eight of our vessels operated under contracts issued under this program. Payments under this program are subject to annual appropriations by Congress and are subject to reduction, such as in 2013 when \u201csequestration\u201d budget cuts reduced the annual payments by almost 11% per vessel. Accordingly, we cannot assure that we will continue to receive these annual payments, in full or in part.\nOur business would be adversely affected if we failed to comply with the Jones Act, or if this law was modified or repealed.\nA substantial portion of our shipping operations are conducted in the U.S. coastwise trade. Under U.S. federal laws known as the \u201cJones Act,\u201d this trade is restricted to vessels built in the United States, owned and manned by U.S. citizens and registered under U.S. Flag. Our failure to comply with these restrictions could subject us to severe penalties, including the permanent loss of the right to engage in U.S. coastwise trade. If the Jones Act were repealed, substantially amended or waived, it could potentially result in additional competition from vessels built in generally lower-cost foreign shipyards and owned and manned by foreign nationals, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. From time to time, advocates of new or expanded free trade agreements have proposed changes to the Jones Act, and other interest groups have lobbied Congress to repeal the Jones Act to facilitate enhanced competition in the U.S. coastwise trade. Although these efforts have not succeeded to date, we cannot assure you that the Jones Act will not be repealed or modified in the future in a way that would be detrimental to our business.\nUnder certain conditions, the U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security can grant waivers of the Jones Act to foreign vessel operators. Thus far, the Secretary has granted waivers only for relatively short periods in connection with natural disasters and the transportation of petroleum released from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Nonetheless, future waivers, particularly if for longer periods, could result in increased competition, which could negatively impact our Jones Act operations.\nTerrorist attacks, piracy and international hostilities can affect the transportation industry, which could adversely affect our business.\nTerrorist attacks or piracy attacks against merchant ships, the outbreak of war, or the existence of international hostilities could adversely affect us in several ways, including:\n\u00b7\ndamaging the world economy;\n\u00b7\nadversely affecting the availability of and demand for transportation services generally, or our vessels in particular;\n\u00b7\nincreasing the cost of insurance;\n\u00b7\ndisrupting our vessel usage or deployment; and\n\u00b7\nadversely affecting the value of our vessels or our ability to profitably operate our vessels and serve our customers.\nMerchant ships remain subject to piracy attacks, particularly in the Gulf of Aden and off the East Coast of Africa. Our industry is a sector of the economy that we believe is particularly likely to be adversely impacted by the effects of political instability, terrorist attacks, war, international hostilities or piracy. In addition, we conduct operations in Indonesia, Southern Mexico, West Africa, the Arabian Gulf, and other areas that are particularly likely to be exposed to the risk of these potential adverse events.\nThe market values of vessels fluctuate over time.\nThe market value of vessels fluctuates significantly, which could adversely affect our liquidity, result in breaches of our financing agreements or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe fluctuation in market value of vessels over time is based upon various factors, including:\n\u00b7\nthe age of the vessel;\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic and market conditions affecting the marine transportation industry, including the demand for cargoes and the availability of vessel financing;\n\u00b7\nthe number of vessels in the world fleet;\n\u00b7\nthe types and sizes of vessels available;\n\u00b7\nchanges in trading patterns or trading routes that affect demand for particular sizes and types of vessels;\n\u00b7\nthe cost of vessels under construction and scrap prices;\n\u00b7\nprevailing levels of time charter and voyage rates;\n\u00b7\nchanges in regulation or competition from other shipping companies and other modes of transportation; and\n\u00b7\ntechnological advances in vessel design and propulsion.\nDeclining values of our vessels could adversely affect us in several respects, including reducing our liquidity by limiting our ability to raise cash by selling or refinancing vessels. Declining vessel values could also result in a breach of loan covenants or trigger events of default under relevant financing agreements that require us to maintain certain loan-to-value ratios. In such instances, if we are unable or unwilling to pledge additional collateral to offset the decline in vessel values, our lenders could accelerate our debt and foreclose on our vessels pledged as collateral for the loans.\nIn addition, accounting pronouncements require that we periodically review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Measurement of the impairment charge is based on the fair value of the asset as provided by third parties as compared to its carrying value. In this respect, management regularly reviews the carrying amount of our vessels in connection with the estimated recoverable amount for each vessel. Such reviews may, from time to time, result in asset write-downs. For instance, in the fourth quarter of 2014, we recorded a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $38.2 million in connection with adopting a plan to sell certain underperforming assets. We could suffer additional impairment charges in the future, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a significant amount of intangible assets on our balance sheet. If our intangible assets became impaired, we may suffer a reduction in our earnings and stockholders\u2019 equity.\nUnder generally accepted accounting principles, intangible assets must be tested for impairment upon a triggering event when such an event or circumstance may indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. If our intangible assets are determined to be impaired in the future, we may be required to record significant, non-cash charges to earnings during the period in which the impairment is determined, which would reduce our net income and subsequently reduce our stockholders\u2019 equity. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we performed an impairment test on our UOS customer relationship intangible assets and determined that the undiscounted cash flow was greater than the carrying value of the assets.\nAs a holding company with no operations of our own, we rely on payments from our operating companies to meet our obligations.\nAs a holding company without any material assets or operations, substantially all of our income and operating cash flow is dependent upon the earnings of our subsidiaries and the distribution of funds by those subsidiaries to us in the form of dividends, loans or other payments. As a result, we rely upon our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our obligations, including the payment of amounts owed under our long-term debt, or to declare and make dividend payments to the holders of our securities. The ability of our subsidiaries to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to allow us and them to make scheduled payments on our respective obligations will depend on their future financial performance, which will be affected by a range of economic, competitive and business factors, many of which are outside of our control. Additionally, our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nand have no obligation to pay any amounts owed by us, or, subject to limited exceptions for tax-sharing purposes, to make any funds available to us to repay our debt or other obligations, whether by dividends, loans or other payments. The law of the jurisdiction of organization applicable to each of our subsidiaries may restrict the amount of dividends that they may pay. Restrictions imposed by credit agreements or leases applicable to certain of our subsidiaries may limit the amount of funds that our subsidiaries are permitted to transfer to us, including the amount of dividends that may be paid to us. In addition, our rights to receive assets of any subsidiary upon its liquidation or reorganization will also be effectively subordinated to the claims of creditors of that subsidiary, including trade creditors.\nOur business and financial alternatives could be constrained by our current obligations and any future borrowings.\nWe are highly leveraged. In addition to the liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2014, we owe substantial amounts under our long-term operating leases. For additional information on our indebtedness and commitments, please see Items 7 and 8 of Part II of this report.\nOur leverage could have material adverse consequences for us, including:\n\u00b7\nlimiting our ability to access the capital markets;\n\u00b7\nhindering our ability to adjust to changing market, industry or economic conditions;\n\u00b7\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of debt, thereby limiting the amount of free cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures, dividends, stock repurchases or growth opportunities;\n\u00b7\nmaking us more vulnerable to economic or industry downturns, including interest rate increases;\n\u00b7\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage to those of our competitors who have less indebtedness;\n\u00b7\nincreasing the risk that we will need to sell securities or assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, to meet payment obligations; or\n\u00b7\nincreasing the risk that we may not meet the financial covenants contained in our debt agreements or timely make all required debt payments.\nThe effect of each of these factors could be intensified if we increase our borrowings or lease commitments.\nOur ability to meet our debt obligations, lease commitments and other expenses will depend upon our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, regulatory and other factors, many of which we are unable to control.\nWe expect to periodically require financing to meet our debt obligations as they come due. Due to the unstable economy and the current credit market environment, we may not be able to refinance maturing debt at terms that are as favorable as those from which we previously benefited, at terms that are acceptable to us or at all. In connection with executing our business strategies, from time to time we evaluate the possibility of acquiring additional vessels or businesses, and we may elect to finance such acquisitions by incurring additional indebtedness. Moreover, if we were to suffer uninsured material losses or liabilities, we could be required to borrow to fund liabilities that we could not pay with our operating cash flow. Our ability to arrange additional financing will depend on, among other factors, our financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are able to obtain additional financing, our credit may be adversely affected and our ability to satisfy our obligations under our current indebtedness could be adversely affected.\nWe cannot assure you that our access to the public debt and equity markets will remain free of disruptions.\nIn the future, we may consider selling debt or equity securities to raise additional funds, including to refinance a portion of our maturing debt. Our ability to arrange any such financing will depend on, among other factors, our financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control. Prevailing market conditions could be adversely affected by disruptions in domestic or overseas sovereign debt markets, contractions or limited growth in the economy or other similar adverse economic developments in the U.S. or abroad. Instability in the global financial markets has from time to time\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nresulted in periodic volatility in the capital markets. This volatility could limit our access to the credit markets, leading to higher borrowing costs or, in some cases, the inability to obtain financing on terms that are as favorable as those from which we previously benefitted, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. Any such failure to obtain additional financing could jeopardize our ability to repay, refinance or reduce our debt obligations.\nIf we incur a change of control, we will be in default under certain of our debt agreements, which could have various adverse ramifications.\nMost of our debt agreements provide that it will be an event of default if we incur a change of control (as defined in such agreements). Unless the lender waives any such default or we pay the debt then owed under the applicable debt agreement, we would default under such debt agreement, which could in turn constitute a default under other of our debt agreements outstanding at that time. We may be unable or unwilling to cure any such event of default, either due to lack of cash, legal or contractual impediments, or otherwise, and we cannot assure you that our lenders would be willing to waive any such events of default or to restructure our debt. Moreover, the existence of these event of default provisions may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of us, or the removal of our incumbent directors.\nWe are subject to certain risks with respect to our counterparties on contracts, and failure of such counterparties to meet their obligations could cause us to suffer losses or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nThe ability of our counterparties to perform their obligations under their contracts with us will depend upon a number of factors that are beyond our control and may include, among other things, general economic conditions and the overall financial condition of these counterparties, especially in light of the current global financial weakness. If our counterparties fail to honor their obligations under their agreements with us, we could sustain significant losses or a reduction in our vessel usage, both of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOlder vessels have higher operating costs and are potentially less desirable to charterers.\nThe average age of the vessels in our fleet that we own or lease, excluding our vessels engaged in U.S. coastwise trade, is approximately thirteen years (or nine years if our partially-owned Mini-Bulk Carriers are included in the average). The average age of our vessels actively engaged in U.S. coastwise trade is approximately 33 years (which reflects the longer vessel lives typically associated with vessels deployed in this trade). See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview\u201d in Item 7 of Part II of this report. In general, capital expenditures and other costs necessary for maintaining and insuring a vessel in good operating condition increase and become more difficult to estimate with accuracy as the age of the vessel increases. Moreover, customers generally prefer modern vessels over older vessels, which places the older vessels at a competitive disadvantage, especially in weak markets. In addition, changes in governmental regulations, compliance with classification society standards and customer requirements or competition may require us to make additional expenditures for alterations or the addition of new equipment. In order to make such alterations or add such equipment, we may be required to take our vessels out of service, thereby reducing our revenues. Expenditures such as these may also require us to incur additional debt or raise additional capital. There can be no assurance that market or general economic conditions will enable us to replace our existing vessels with new vessels, justify the expenditures necessary to maintain our older vessels in good operating condition or enable us to operate our older vessels profitably during the remainder of their estimated useful lives.\nOur business and operations are highly regulated, which can adversely affect our operations.\nOur business and the shipping industry in general are subject to increasingly stringent local, state, federal, and international laws and regulations governing, among other things, the health and safety of our employees, and the staffing, construction, operation, insurance and transfer of our vessels. Many aspects of our operations are subject to regulation by a wide array of agencies, including the U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the National Transportation Safety Board, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the International Maritime Organization, as well as various foreign agencies that regulate our operations under their respective jurisdictions. Compliance with or the enforcement of applicable laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. For example, in the event of war or national emergency, our U.S. Flag vessels are subject to requisition by the U.S. government. Although we would be entitled to compensation in the event of a requisition of our vessels, the amount and timing of such payments would be uncertain and there would be no guarantee that such amounts would be paid, or if paid, would fully satisfy lost profits associated with the requisition.\nIn addition, we are required by various governmental and quasi-governmental agencies to obtain, maintain and periodically renew certain permits, licenses and certificates with respect to our operations. In certain instances, the failure to obtain, maintain or renew these authorizations could have a material adverse effect on our business. We may also be required to periodically modify\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\noperating procedures or alter or introduce new equipment for our existing vessels to appropriately respond to changes in governmental regulation, safety or equipment standards, or our customer\u2019s needs. If the costs associated with these changes are material, they could adversely affect our financial condition or financial performance.\nOur business and the operation of our vessels are subject to extensive international, national and local environmental, health and safety laws in the jurisdictions in which our vessels operate, as well as in the country or countries of their registration. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in penalties, sanctions or, in certain cases, the ultimate suspension or termination of our operations.\nInternational, national and local laws imposing liability for oil spills or other ship-generated pollution are also becoming increasingly stringent. Some impose joint, several, and in some cases, unlimited liability on owners, operators and charterers regardless of fault. We could be held liable as an owner, operator or charterer under these laws. In addition, under certain circumstances, we could also be held accountable under these laws for acts or omissions of our affiliates, our charterers or other parties in connection with the management or operation of our vessels. Liability for a catastrophic spill could exceed the insurance coverage we have available, and result in our having to liquidate assets to pay claims. In addition, we may be required to contribute to funds established by regulatory authorities for the remediation of oil pollution damage or to provide financial assurances for oil spill liability to regulatory authorities.\nRegulation of our customers\u2019 businesses could further impact our operations.\nThe profitability and viability of certain of our customers\u2019 businesses are dependent upon laws and regulations governing their operations. Laws that restrict or preclude their operations could reduce demand for certain vessels. Specifically, currently-pending U.S. governmental proposals to enhance the regulation of carbon emissions could, over time, reduce the demand for our coal-carrying vessels.\nIncreased security and inspection procedures and tighter import and export controls could increase costs and disrupt our business.\nInternational maritime shipping is subject to various security and customs inspections and related procedures in countries of origin and destination. For instance, various government agencies within the Department of Homeland Security, including the Transportation Security Administration, the U.S. Coast Guard and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, have adopted several rules, policies or regulations, including regulations that require us to operate certain of our vessels and facilities pursuant to both applicable maritime security regulations and approved security plans. Applicable inspection procedures can result in the seizure of contents of our vessels, delays in delivering cargoes, and the levying of customs payments, duties, fines and other penalties against us. Under certain circumstances, our failure to comply with these regulations could restrict our ability to operate certain of our vessels or facilities.\nThe U.S. government, foreign governments, international organizations, and industry associations have from time to time considered ways to expand inspection procedures. Such changes, if implemented, could impose additional financial and legal obligations on us, including additional responsibility for physically inspecting the contents of cargoes we are shipping. Furthermore, changes to inspection procedures could also impose additional costs and obligations on our customers and may, in certain cases, render the shipment of certain types of cargo impractical. Any such changes or developments may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur failure to pass inspection by classification societies and regulators could result in one or more of our vessels being unemployable unless and until they pass inspection, resulting in a loss of revenues from such vessels for that period.\nThe hull and machinery of every commercial vessel must be classed by an international classification society authorized by its country of registry, as well as being subject to survey and inspection by shipping regulatory bodies. The international classification society certifies that a vessel is safe and seaworthy in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations of the country of registry of the vessel and the United Nations Safety of Life at Sea Convention.\nDue to the age of several of our vessels, the repairs and remediations required in connection with classification society surveys and inspections may be extensive and require significant expenditures. Additionally, if any of our vessels fails to pass such a survey or inspection or is required to be repaired or remediated as a result of any such survey or inspection, the vessel may be unable to trade between ports and, therefore, would be unemployable. Any such loss of the use of a vessel could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations, and any such impact may be material.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe face periodic drydocking costs for our vessels, which can be substantial.\nVessels must be drydocked periodically for regulatory compliance and for maintenance and repair. Our drydocking requirements are subject to associated risks, including delay and cost overruns, lack of necessary equipment, unforeseen engineering problems, employee strikes or other work stoppages, unanticipated cost increases, inability to obtain necessary certifications and approvals and shortages of materials or skilled labor. A significant delay in drydockings could have an adverse effect on our contract commitments. The cost of repairs and renewals required at each drydock are difficult to predict with certainty and can be substantial. Our insurance does not cover these costs.\nWe are subject to the risk of price volatility on the fuel we consume in connection with certain of our operations.\nAlthough our customers are responsible for fuel costs with respect to a substantial portion of our operations, we have some exposure to fuel price risks under various of our other operations. Due to the competitive nature of these other operations, we can give no assurance that we will be able to offset fuel price volatility. Although we currently have some fuel surcharges in place, a material change in current fuel prices that are not covered by these fuel surcharges could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to risks associated with operating internationally.\nOur non-domestic operations are subject to varying degrees of regulation in each of the foreign jurisdictions in which we provide services. Local laws and regulations, and their interpretation and enforcement, differ significantly among those jurisdictions, and can change significantly over time. Future regulatory, judicial and legislative changes or interpretations may have a material adverse effect on our ability to deliver services in foreign jurisdictions.\nIn addition to these international regulatory risks, some of the other risks inherent in conducting business internationally include:\n\u00b7\ntax, licensing, political or other business restrictions or requirements;\n\u00b7\neconomic, political and social instability, with the attendant risks of extortion or civil unrest;\n\u00b7\npotential vessel seizure, terrorist attacks, piracy, kidnapping, the expropriation of assets and other governmental actions, many of which are not covered by our insurance;\n\u00b7\ncurrency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u00b7\npotential submission of disputes to the jurisdiction of a foreign court or arbitration panel;\n\u00b7\npandemics or epidemics that disrupt worldwide trade or the movement of vessels;\n\u00b7\nlonger payment cycles and problems collecting accounts receivable;\n\u00b7\nimport and export restrictions, including the risk of fines or penalties assessed for violations;\n\u00b7\nembargoes or other restrictive governmental actions that could limit our ability to operate in foreign countries;\n\u00b7\nadditional U.S. and other regulation of non-domestic operations, including regulation under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d) as well as other anti-corruption laws;\n\u00b7\nthe inability to enforce our contract rights, either due to under-developed legal systems or government actions that result in a deprivation of contract rights;\n\u00b7\nlimitations in the availability, amount or terms of insurance coverage;\n\u00b7\nlaws, policies or practices that restrict with whom we can contract or otherwise limit the scope of operations that can legally or practicably be conducted within any particular country;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u00b7\nthe imposition of unanticipated or increased taxes, increased environmental and safety regulations or other forms of public or governmental regulation that increase our operating expenses; and\n\u00b7\nchallenges in staffing and managing foreign operations.\nMany of these risks are beyond our control, and we cannot predict the nature or the likelihood of the occurrence or corresponding effect of any such events, each of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nMoreover, in order to effectively compete in certain foreign jurisdictions, it is frequently necessary or required to establish joint ventures, strategic alliances or vessel revenue sharing agreements with other shipping companies or local operators, partners or agents. In certain instances, these local operators, partners or agents may have interests that are not always aligned with ours. Reliance on local operators, partners or agents could expose us to the risk of being unable to control the scope or quality of our overseas services or products, or being held liable under the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws for actions taken by our strategic or local partners or agents even though these partners or agents may not themselves be subject to the FCPA or other applicable anti-corruption laws. Any determination that we have violated the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, reputation or prospects.\nOur vessels could be seized by maritime claimants, which could result in a significant loss of earnings and cash flow for the related off-hire period.\nUnder general maritime law in many jurisdictions, crew members, vessel mortgagees, suppliers of goods and services to a vessel, shippers of cargo and other parties may be entitled to a maritime lien against a vessel for unsatisfied debts or claims for damages. In many jurisdictions, a maritime lienholder may enforce its lien by either arresting or attaching a vessel through foreclosure proceedings. The arrest or attachment of one or more of our vessels could result in a significant loss of earnings and cash flow during the detainment period.\nIn some jurisdictions, under the extended \u201csister ship\u201d theory of liability, a claimant may arrest not only the vessel with respect to which the claimant\u2019s maritime lien has arisen, but also any associated vessel under common ownership or control. Consequently, a claim may be asserted against us or any of our subsidiaries or our vessels for the liability of one or more of the other vessels we own. While we have insurance coverage for these types of claims, we cannot guarantee it will cover all of our potential exposure.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain skilled crew members, our reputation and ability to operate safely and efficiently may be harmed.\nOur continued success depends in significant part on the continued services of the officers and seamen who operate our vessels. Currently, we believe the market for hiring qualified, experienced officers and seamen is adequate. We cannot assure you that we will continue to be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain properly skilled personnel at commercially reasonable salaries. Any failure to do so could adversely affect our ability to operate cost-effectively.\nA substantial number of our shipboard employees are unionized. In the event of a strike or other work stoppage, our business and operations may be adversely affected.\nAs of December 31, 2014, all of our U.S. shipboard personnel were unionized employees covered by collective bargaining agreements.\nGiven the prevalence of maritime trade unions and their corresponding influence over its members, the shipping industry is vulnerable to work stoppages and other potentially disruptive actions by employees. We may also have difficulty successfully negotiating renewals to our collective bargaining agreements with these unions or face resistance to any future efforts to place restraints on wages, reduce labor costs or moderate work practices. Any of these events may result in strikes, work disruptions and have other potentially adverse consequences. While we have experienced no strikes, work stoppages or other significant labor problems during the last ten years, we cannot assure that such events will not occur in the future or be material in nature. In the event we experience one or more strikes, work stoppages or other labor problems, our business and, in turn, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIncreases in costs for pension and healthcare benefits for our active and retired employees may reduce our profitability and liquidity and increase our funding commitments.\nOur costs of maintaining our pension, healthcare and other plans, and the future funding requirements for these plans, are affected by several factors, most of which are outside our control, including:\n\u00b7\ndecreases in mortality rates;\n\u00b7\ndecreases in investment returns on funds held by our pension and other benefit plan trusts;\n\u00b7\nchanges in prevailing interest rates and the discount rate used to calculate pension and other post-retirement expenses;\n\u00b7\nincreases in healthcare costs generally or claims submitted under our healthcare plans specifically;\n\u00b7\nthe continuing implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and the related reconciliation act and regulations promulgated thereunder;\n\u00b7\nincreases in the number of retirees who elect to receive lump sum benefit payments;\n\u00b7\nchanges in plan benefits; and\n\u00b7\nchanges in funding laws or regulations.\nDomestically, we participate in and make periodic contributions to various multi-employer pension plans under union and industry-wide agreements that generally provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. Funding requirements for benefit obligations of multi-employer pension plans are subject to certain regulatory requirements and we may be required to make cash contributions which may be material to one or more of these plans to satisfy certain underfunded benefit obligations. In addition, if a multi-employer plan fails to satisfy the minimum funding requirements, the Internal Revenue Service may impose certain penalties and taxes.\nAbsent an applicable exemption, a contributor to a multi-employer plan is liable, upon termination or withdrawal from the plan, for its proportionate share of the plan\u2019s underfunded vested liability. Based on the limited information available from plan administrators, which we cannot independently validate, we believe that our portion of the contingent liability in the case of a full withdrawal or termination may be material to our financial position and results of operations. Moreover, in the event that any other contributing employer withdraws from any plan that is underfunded, and such employer (or any member in its controlled group) cannot satisfy its obligations under the plan at the time of withdrawal, then we, along with the other remaining contributing employers, would be liable for our proportionate share of such plan\u2019s unfunded vested benefits.\nDelays or cost overruns in building new vessels (including the failure to deliver new vessels) could harm us.\nBuilding new vessels is time consuming, which makes it more difficult to adjust quickly to changes in industry conditions. Moreover, building new vessels is subject to risks of delay (including the failure to timely deliver new vessels to customers) or cost overruns caused by one or more of the following:\n\u00b7\nfinancial difficulties of the shipyard building a vessel, including bankruptcy;\n\u00b7\nlack of shipyard availability;\n\u00b7\nunforeseen engineering or construction problems;\n\u00b7\nchanges to design specifications;\n\u00b7\nwork stoppages;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u00b7\nweather interference;\n\u00b7\ndelays or unanticipated shortages with respect to necessary materials, equipment or skilled labor; and\n\u00b7\ninability to obtain the requisite permits, approvals or certifications from governmental authorities and the applicable classification society upon completion of work.\nSignificant delays, cost overruns and failure to timely deliver new vessels we have committed to service one or more of our customers could adversely affect us in several ways, including delaying the implementation of our business strategies or materially increasing our cost of servicing our commitments to our customers.\nSome of our employees are covered by laws limiting our protection from exposure to certain claims.\nSome of our employees are covered by several maritime laws, statutes and regulations which circumvent and nullify certain liability limits established by state workers\u2019 compensation laws, including provisions of the Jones Act, the Death on the High Seas Act, and the Seamen\u2019s Wage Act. We are not generally protected by the limits imposed by state workers\u2019 compensation statutes for these particular employees, and as a result, our exposure for claims asserted by these employees may be greater than would otherwise be the case.\nWe are subject to the control of our principal stockholders.\nAs of March 4, 2015, two of our current directors, Niels M. Johnsen and Erik L. Johnsen, and their respective family members and affiliated entities, beneficially owned an aggregate of 20.5% of our common stock. Niels M. Johnsen and Erik L. Johnsen are also executive officers of the Company, and their respective fathers were formerly executive officers and directors. As a result, the Johnsen family may have the ability to exert significant influence over our affairs and management, including the election of directors, delaying or opposing a change of control transaction, and effecting other corporate actions requiring stockholder approval.\nBecause some of our expenses are incurred in foreign currencies, we are exposed to exchange rate risks.\nWhile we incur most of our expenses in U.S. dollars, we have in the past incurred operating expenses in other currencies, most notably the Mexican Peso and Indonesian Rupiah. Declines in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the currencies in these jurisdictions, or other currencies in which we may in the future incur expenses, would increase the U.S. dollar cost of paying these expenses and thus would adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe selectively enter into hedging derivative contracts, which can result in higher than market interest rates and charges against our income.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we are exposed to foreign currency, interest rate and commodity price risks. From time to time, we utilize derivative financial instruments including interest rate swap agreements and forward exchange contracts, and in the past we have also utilized commodity swap agreements to manage certain of these exposures. We hedge only firm commitments or anticipated transactions and do not use derivatives for speculation. We neither hold nor issue financial instruments for trading purposes. Nevertheless, even though our hedging strategies are designed to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations, entering into swaps and forward exchange contracts is inherently risky. The derivative strategies that we employ in the future may not be successful or effective, and we could, as a result, incur substantial additional interest costs or charges against our income. For further information, see \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Information About Market Risk\u201d in Item 7A of Part II of this report.\nLoss of our senior management or other key personnel could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur future success will depend, in significant part, upon the continued services of our senior management team and other key personnel, especially those of our Chief Executive Officer, President, and Chief Financial Officer, who have substantial experience in the shipping industry and over 117 years of collective experience with us. We believe that the experience of our senior management team is a vital component to maintain long-term relationships with our customers. The loss of the services of any of these individuals could adversely affect our future operating results, and we may have to incur significant costs to find sufficient replacements for them, if available.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe are susceptible to severe weather and natural disasters.\nGiven the nature and scope of our operations, we are constantly vulnerable to disruption as a result of adverse weather conditions, including hurricanes, typhoons, earthquakes and other natural disasters. These types of events may, among other things:\n\u00b7\nhinder our ability to effectively and timely provide scheduled service to our customers whether due to damage to our properties, to our customers\u2019 operations, or to dock or other transportation facilities;\n\u00b7\ninterfere with our terminal operations;\n\u00b7\ndamage our vessels and equipment; or\n\u00b7\nresult in injury or death to our employees.\nAny of these factors, especially to the extent not fully covered by insurance, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nThere is a significant amount of data suggesting that adverse weather conditions are likely to intensify in the future due to global climate change. If so, our susceptibility to the risks discussed above will likely increase.\nWe are exposed to various tax risks.\nAs a taxpayer, we are subject to frequent and regular audits and examinations by the Internal Revenue Service, as well as state and local tax authorities. Because the ultimate outcomes of these matters are uncertain, we can give no assurance as to whether an adverse result from one or more of them will have a material effect on our financial results.\nWe believe that we should not be subject to tax under the laws of any country other than the United States or Singapore in which we conduct activities or in which our customers are located. However, our belief is based on our understanding of the tax laws of those countries, and our tax position is subject to review and possible challenge by taxing authorities and to possible changes in law or interpretation. We cannot determine in advance the extent to which certain jurisdictions may require us to pay tax or to make payments in lieu of tax. In addition, payments due to us from our customers could potentially be subject to tax claims.\nThe laws governing our ability to utilize NOLs are complex. We cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to utilize our NOLs as anticipated, or that these NOLs will not be depleted sooner than expected. If and when our NOLs are fully utilized, we expect that the amount of our cash flow dedicated to the payment of federal taxes will increase substantially.\nOur business is subject to potential security breaches or other system failures.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information, to communicate with our vessels, to manage or support a variety of our other business operations, transactions and processes, and to maintain various records, which may include personally identifiable information of customers, employees or other third parties. We make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of information and systems (and maintain contingency plans in the event of security breaches or system disruptions). Nonetheless, we have experienced some relatively minor system failures in the past and anticipate experiencing additional failures in the future. We cannot assure you that our security efforts and measures will prevent unauthorized access to our systems, loss or destruction of data, account takeovers, or other forms of cyber-attacks or similar events, whether caused by mechanical failures, human error, fraud, malice, sabotage or otherwise. The frequency, scope and sophistication of cyber-attacks continue to grow, which increases the possibility that our security measures will be unable to prevent our systems\u2019 improper functioning or the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information. Any failure of our information or communications systems, whether caused by attacks, mechanical failures, natural disasters or otherwise, could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, or subject us to claims, any of which could materially and adversely affect us.\nWe are exposed to risks arising out of recent legislation affecting U.S. public companies, including risks relating to evaluations of controls required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nChanging laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and related regulations implemented thereunder, have increased legal and financial compliance costs and made some activities more time consuming. Any future failure to successfully or timely complete annual assessments of our internal controls required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nsubject us to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, which could in turn adversely affect our financial results or investors\u2019 confidence in us. If we fail to maintain effective controls and procedures, we may be unable to provide financial information in a timely and reliable manner, which could in certain instances limit our ability to borrow or raise capital.\nIf conditions or assumptions differ from the judgments, assumptions or estimates used in our critical accounting policies, the accuracy of our financial statements and related disclosures could be affected.\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. For a discussion of our critical accounting policies, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies\u201d in Item 7 of Part II of this report. If future events or assumptions differ significantly from the judgments, assumptions and estimates in our critical accounting policies, these events or assumptions could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nProvisions in our organizational documents would make it difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if such a transaction is beneficial to our stockholders.\nOur organizational documents:\n\u00b7\nprovide for blank check preferred stock;\n\u00b7\nprevent stockholders from calling special stockholder meetings or voting cumulatively;\n\u00b7\nimpose certain foreign ownership limits with respect to our stock (which are discussed further below); and\n\u00b7\ninclude various other provisions that could impede, delay or prevent certain takeovers or change of control transactions.\nIn addition, as noted under \u201c- Risk Factors Related To Our Business - We are subject to the control of our principal stockholders,\u201d the Johnsen family beneficially owns a substantial portion of our common stock. These provisions and circumstances could deter a third party from tendering for the purchase of some or all of our shares. These provisions and circumstances may have the effect of impeding, delaying or preventing changes of control of the ownership and management of ISH, even if such transactions would have significant benefits to our stockholders.\nOur certificate of incorporation limits the ownership of common stock by persons who are not U.S. citizens, which could have certain adverse effects.\nWe must comply with certain stock ownership requirements in order to assure that we will be permitted to engage in United States coastwise trade, as well as participate in certain financing and other maritime programs administered by the U.S. Maritime Administration, or MARAD. Failure to comply with these requirements could jeopardize our continued eligibility to engage in such coastwise trade and to participate in such MARAD programs. To assure such compliance, our certificate of incorporation, or Charter, includes certain provisions designed to enable us to regulate the ownership of our capital stock by persons who are not citizens of the United States.\nOur Charter provides that any transfer or purported transfer of shares of our capital stock that would result in the ownership by Non-Citizens (as defined in our Charter) of our capital stock having more than 23% of the total voting power would generally be void. Voting rights will be denied to any shares owned by Non-Citizens in excess of 23%, which we refer to as the Excess Shares, and we will withhold dividends with respect to such Excess Shares on the terms and conditions specified in the Charter. In addition, our Charter authorizes us to redeem shares of our capital stock owned by Non-Citizens in excess of 23% in order to reduce ownership by Non-Citizens to 23%.\nThese foreign ownership restrictions could limit the trading liquidity of our common stock by reducing our pool of potential stockholders. In addition, if we were to seek to sell any portion of our business that owns any of our Jones Act vessels, we would have fewer potential purchasers, since some potential purchasers might be unable or unwilling to satisfy the foreign ownership restrictions described above. As a result, the sales price for that portion of our business may not attain the amount that could be obtained in an unregulated market.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nFuture acquisitions of vessels or businesses by us would subject us to additional business, operating and industry risks, the impact of which cannot presently be evaluated, and could adversely impact our capital structure.\nFrom time to time in the future we may pursue other acquisition or expansion opportunities in an effort to implement our business strategies. These transactions could involve acquisitions of entire businesses or one or more vessels, and could take several forms, including mergers, joint ventures, investments in new lines of business, or the purchase of equity interests or assets. These types of transactions may present significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, insufficient revenue acquired to offset liabilities assumed, unexpected expenses, inadequate return of capital, regulatory or compliance issues, potential violations of covenants in the Company\u2019s debt instruments and other unidentified issues not discovered in due diligence. To the extent we acquire a business that is financially unstable or is otherwise subject to a high level of risk, we may be affected by the currently unascertainable risks of that business. Accordingly, there is no current basis for you to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the particular business or assets that we may acquire. Moreover, we cannot guarantee that any such transaction will ultimately result in the realization of the benefits of the transaction originally anticipated by us or that any such transaction will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, the financing of any future acquisition completed by us could adversely impact our capital structure as any such financing would likely include the issuance of additional securities or the borrowing of additional funds. Except as required by law or the rules of any securities exchange on which our securities might be listed at the time we seek to consummate an acquisition, we do not expect to ask our stockholders to vote on any proposed acquisition.", "PERMNO": 45437, "SIC": 4400, "TIC": "ISHCQ"}
