{"cik": "1616262", "company": "Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-06-01", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRisks Specific to Our Company and Strategy\nOur Sales to Specialty Market Customers, Customers Outside Our System of Franchised Stores, Are Concentrated Among a Small Number of Customers.\nThe Company has historically sold its product to relatively few customers outside its network of franchised and licensed locations (specialty markets). Until 2019 much of the revenue generated from sales to specialty markets was derived from sales to FTD Companies, Inc. In June 2019 FTD Companies, Inc. and its domestic subsidiaries (\u201cFTD\u201d), filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. As a part of such bankruptcy proceedings, divisions of FTD\u2019s business and certain related assets, including the divisions that the Company has historically sold product to, were sold through an auction to multiple buyers. The Company does not expect future revenues from FTD to be significant.\nBeginning in FY 2020 and continuing in FY 2021 the Company began selling its products to Edible under a strategic alliance. Sales to Edible constituted much of our revenue derived from sales to specialty markets during FY 2021. Revenue from Edible represented approximately $3.5 million or 15% of our total revenues during the year ended February 28, 2021, compared to revenue of approximately $320,000 or 1% of our total revenues during the year ended February 29, 2020. The loss of Edible, or any other specialty markets customer could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability. There is no assurance that the strategic alliance and ecommerce agreements will be deployed into our operations and to our satisfaction, or that we will achieve the expected full benefits from these agreements. Subsequent to February 28, 2021, certain disagreements arose between RMCF and Edible related to the strategic alliance and ecommerce agreements resulting in continuing discussions, the result of which are not currently determinable. There can be no assurance historical revenue levels will be indicative of future revenues.\nOur Growth is Dependent Upon Attracting and Retaining Qualified Franchisees and Their Ability to Operate Their Franchised Stores Successfully.\nOur continued growth and success is dependent in part upon our ability to attract, retain and contract with qualified franchisees. Our growth is dependent upon the ability of franchisees to operate their stores successfully, promote and develop our store concepts, and maintain our reputation for an enjoyable in-store experience and high-quality products. Although we have established criteria to evaluate prospective franchisees and have been successful in attracting franchisees, there can be no assurance that franchisees will be able to operate successfully in their franchise areas in a manner consistent with our concepts and standards.\nOur Expansion Plans Are Dependent on the Availability of Suitable Sites for Franchised Stores at Reasonable Occupancy Costs.\nOur expansion plans are critically dependent on our ability to obtain suitable sites for franchised stores at reasonable occupancy costs for our franchised stores in high foot traffic retail environments. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain suitable locations for our franchised stores in this environment at a cost that will allow such stores to be economically viable. There is also no assurance that we will be able to obtain locations with suitable foot traffic as a result of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact it has had on consumer\u2019s ability to shop in person when compared to historical shopping patterns.\nSame Store Sales Have Fluctuated and Will Continue to Fluctuate on a Regular Basis.\nOur same store sales, defined as year-over-year sales for a store that has been open at least one year, have fluctuated significantly in the past on an annual and quarterly basis and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future. During the past five fiscal years, same store sales results at Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory franchise stores have fluctuated as follows: (a) from (24.8%) to 1.0% for annual results; and (b) from (29.3%) to 2.9% for quarterly results. During the past five fiscal years, same store sales results at U-Swirl franchise stores have fluctuated as follows: (a) from (39.4%) to 1.3% for annual results; and (b) from (29.5%) to 8.7% for quarterly results. Sustained declines in same store sales or significant same store sales declines in any single period could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Same store sales declined during FY 2021 and established the large negative percentage changes reflected above, primarily as a result of nearly all of the franchise stores being directly and negatively impacted by public health measures taken in response to COVID-19, with nearly all locations experiencing reduced operations as a result of, among other things, modified business hours and store and mall closures.\nIncreases in Costs Could Adversely Affect Our Operations.\nInflationary factors such as increases in the costs of ingredients, energy and labor directly affect our operations. Most of our leases provide for cost-of-living adjustments and require us to pay taxes, insurance and maintenance expenses, all of which are subject to inflation. Additionally, our future lease costs for new facilities may reflect potentially escalating costs of real estate and construction. There is no assurance that we will be able to pass on our increased costs to our customers.\nPrice Increases May Not Be Sufficient To Offset Cost Increases And Maintain Profitability Or May Result In Sales Volume Declines Associated With Pricing Elasticity.\nWe may be able to pass some or all raw materials, energy and other input cost increases to customers by increasing the selling prices of our products, however, higher product prices may also result in a reduction in sales volume and/or consumption. If we are not able to increase our selling prices sufficiently, or in a timely manner, to offset increased raw material, energy or other input costs, including packaging, direct labor, overhead and employee benefits, or if our sales volume decreases significantly, there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Seasonality of Our Sales and New Store Openings Can Have a Significant Impact on Our Financial Results from Quarter to Quarter.\nOur sales and earnings are seasonal, with significantly higher sales and earnings occurring during key holidays and summer vacation season than at other times of the year, which causes fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations. In addition, quarterly results have been, and in the future are likely to be, affected by the timing of new store openings and the sale of franchises. Because of the seasonality of our business and the impact of new store openings and sales of franchises, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved in other quarters or for a full fiscal year.\nThe Retailing of Confectionery and Frozen Dessert Products is Highly Competitive and Many of Our Competitors Have Competitive Advantages Over Us.\nThe retailing of confectionery and frozen dessert products is highly competitive. We and our franchisees compete with numerous businesses that offer similar products. Many of these competitors have greater name recognition and financial, marketing and other resources than we do. In addition, there is intense competition among retailers for real estate sites, store personnel and qualified franchisees. Competitive market conditions could have a material adverse effect on us and our results of operations and our ability to expand successfully.\nChanges in Consumer Tastes and Trends Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Operations.\nThe sale of our products is affected by changes in consumer tastes and eating habits, including views regarding consumption of chocolate and frozen yogurt. Numerous other factors that we cannot control, such as economic conditions, demographic trends, traffic patterns and weather conditions, influence the sale of our products. Changes in any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on us and our results of operations.\nWe Are Subject to Federal, State and Local Regulation.\nWe are subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission and must comply with certain state laws governing the offer, sale and termination of franchises and the refusal to renew franchises. Many state laws also regulate substantive aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship by, for example, requiring the franchisor to deal with its franchisees in good faith, prohibiting interference with the right of free association among franchisees and regulating discrimination among franchisees in charges, royalties or fees. Franchise laws continue to develop and change, and changes in such laws could impose additional costs and burdens on franchisors. Our failure to obtain approvals to sell franchises and the adoption of new franchise laws, or changes in existing laws, could have a material adverse effect on us and our results of operations.\nEach of our Company-owned and franchised stores is subject to licensing and regulation by the health, sanitation, safety, building and fire agencies in the state or municipality where located. Difficulties or failures in obtaining required licenses or approvals from such agencies could delay or prevent the opening of a new store. We and our franchisees are also subject to laws governing our relationships with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working and safety conditions and citizenship requirements. Because a significant number of our employees are paid at rates related to the federal minimum wage, increases in the minimum wage would increase our labor costs. The failure to obtain required licenses or approvals, or an increase in the minimum wage rate, employee benefits costs (including costs associated with mandated health insurance coverage) or other costs associated with employees, could have a material adverse effect on us and our results of operations.\nCompanies engaged in the manufacturing, packaging and distribution of food products are subject to extensive regulation by various governmental agencies. A finding of a failure to comply with one or more regulations could result in the imposition of sanctions, including the closing of all or a portion of our facilities for an indeterminate period of time, and could have a material adverse effect on us and our results of operations.\nInformation Technology System Failures, Breaches of our Network Security or Inability to Upgrade or Expand our Technological Capabilities Could Interrupt our Operations and Adversely Affect our Business.\nWe and our franchisees rely on our computer systems and network infrastructure across our operations, including point-of-sale processing at our stores. Our and our franchisees\u2019 operations depend upon our and our franchisees\u2019 ability to protect our computer equipment and systems against damage from physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events, as well as from internal and external cybersecurity breaches, viruses and other disruptive problems. Any damage or failure of our computer systems or network infrastructure that causes an interruption in our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and subject us or our franchisees to litigation or to actions by regulatory authorities. Furthermore, the importance of such information technology systems and networks increased in FY 2021 due to many of our employees working remotely as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nA party who is able to compromise the security measures on our networks or the security of our infrastructure could, among other things, misappropriate our proprietary information and the personal information of our customers and employees, cause interruptions or malfunctions in our or our franchisee\u2019s operations, cause delays or interruptions to our ability to operate, cause us to breach our legal, regulatory or contractual obligations, create an inability to access or rely upon critical business records or cause other disruptions in our operations. These breaches may result from human errors, equipment failure, or fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties.\nWe expend financial resources to protect against such threats and may be required to further expend financial resources to alleviate problems caused by physical, electronic, and cyber security breaches. As techniques used to breach security are growing in frequency and sophistication and are generally not recognized until launched against a target, regardless of our expenditures and protection efforts, we may not be able to implement security measures in a timely manner or, if and when implemented, these measures could be circumvented. Any breaches that may occur could expose us to increased risk of lawsuits, loss of existing or potential future customers, harm to our reputation and increases in our security costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and operating results.\nIn the event of a breach resulting in loss of data, such as personally identifiable information or other such data protected by data privacy or other laws, we may be liable for damages, fines and penalties for such losses under applicable regulatory frameworks despite not handling the data. Further, the regulatory framework around data custody, data privacy and breaches varies by jurisdiction and is an evolving area of law. We may not be able to limit our liability or damages in the event of such a loss.\nWe are also continuing to expand, upgrade and develop our information technology capabilities, including our point-of-sale systems, as well as the adoption of cloud services for e-mail, intranet, and file storage. If we are unable to successfully upgrade or expand our technological capabilities, we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities, manage our costs and transactional data effectively, satisfy customer requirements, execute our business plan or respond to competitive pressures. Additionally, unforeseen problems with our point-of-sale system may affect our operational abilities and internal controls and we may incur additional costs in connection with such upgrades and expansion.\nIf We, our Business Partners, or our Franchisees Are Unable to Protect our Customers\u2019 Data, We Could Be Exposed to Data Loss, Litigation, Liability and Reputational Damage.\nIn connection with credit and debit card sales, we and our franchisees transmit confidential credit and debit card information by way of secure private retail networks. A number of retailers have experienced actual or potential security breaches in which credit and debit card information may have been stolen. Although we and our franchisees use private networks, third parties may have the technology or know-how to breach the security of the customer information transmitted in connection with credit and debit card sales, and our and our franchisees\u2019 security measures and those of our and our franchisees\u2019 technology vendors may not effectively prohibit others from obtaining improper access to this information. If a person were able to circumvent these security measures, he or she could destroy or steal valuable information or disrupt our and our franchisees\u2019 operations. Any security breach could expose us and our franchisees to risks of data loss and liability and could seriously disrupt our and our franchisees\u2019 operations and any resulting negative publicity could significantly harm our reputation. We may also be subject to lawsuits or other proceedings in the future relating to these types of incidents. Proceedings related to theft of credit and debit card information may be brought by payment card providers, banks, and credit unions that issue cards, cardholders (either individually or as part of a class action lawsuit), and federal and state regulators. Any such proceedings could harm our reputation, distract our management team members from running our business and cause us to incur significant unplanned liabilities, losses and expenses.\nWe also sell and accept for payment gift cards, and our customer loyalty program provides rewards that can be redeemed for purchases. Like credit and debit cards, gift cards, and rewards earned by our customers are vulnerable to theft, whether physical or electronic. We believe that, due to their electronic nature, rewards earned through our customer loyalty program are primarily vulnerable to hacking. Customers affected by any loss of data or funds could litigate against us, and security breaches or even unsuccessful attempts at hacking could harm our reputation, and guarding against or responding to hacks could require significant time and resources.\nWe also receive and maintain certain personal information about our customers, including information received through our marketing programs, franchisees and business partners. The use of this information by us is regulated at the federal and state levels. If our security and information systems are compromised or our employees fail to comply with these laws and regulations and this information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately, it could adversely affect our reputation, as well as the results of operations, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties. In addition, our ability to accept credit and debit cards as payment in our stores and online depends on us maintaining our compliance status with standards set by the PCI Security Standards Council. These standards, set by a consortium of the major credit card companies, require certain levels of system security and procedures to protect our customers\u2019 credit and debit card information as well as other personal information. Privacy and information security laws and regulations change over time, and compliance with those changes may result in cost increases due to necessary system and process changes.\nWe Are Subject to Periodic Litigation, Which Could Result in Unexpected Expense of Time and Resources.\nFrom time to time, we are called upon to defend ourselves against lawsuits relating to our business. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. An unfavorable outcome in any current or future legal proceedings could have an adverse impact on our business, and financial results. In addition, any significant litigation in the future, regardless of its merits, could divert management's attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees. Any litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business.\nChanges in Health Benefit Claims and Healthcare Reform Legislation Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Operations.\nWe accrue for costs to provide self-insured benefits for our employee health benefits program. We accrue for self-insured health benefits based on historical claims experience and we maintain insurance coverage to prevent financial losses from catastrophic health benefit claims. We monitor pending and enacted legislation in an effort to evaluate the effects of such legislation upon our business. Our financial position or results of operations could be materially adversely impacted should we experience a material increase in claims costs or a change in healthcare legislation that impacts our business. Our accrued liability for self-insured employee health benefits at February 28, 2021 and February 29, 2020 was $129,000 and $153,000, respectively.\nOur Expansion Into New Markets May Present Increased Risks Due To Our Unfamiliarity With Those Areas And Our Target Customers\u2019 Unfamiliarity With Our Brands.\nConsumers in any new markets we enter will not be familiar with our brands, and we will need to build brand awareness in those markets through significant investments in advertising and promotional activity. We may find it more difficult in our markets to secure desirable locations and to hire, motivate and keep qualified employees.\nIssues Or Concerns Related To The Quality And Safety Of Our Products, Ingredients Or Packaging Could Cause A Product Recall And/Or Result In Harm To The Company\u2019s Reputation, Negatively Impacting Our Results of Operations.\nIn order to sell our products, we need to maintain a good reputation with our customers and consumers. Issues related to the quality and safety of our products, ingredients or packaging could jeopardize our Company\u2019s image and reputation. Negative publicity related to these types of concerns, or related to product contamination or product tampering, whether valid or not, could decrease demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions. We may need to recall products if any of our products become unfit for consumption. In addition, we could potentially be subject to litigation or government actions, which could result in payments of fines or damages. Costs associated with these potential actions could negatively affect our results of operations.\nIf We Face Labor Shortages or Increased Labor Costs, our Results of Operations and our Growth Could Be Adversely Affected.\nLabor is a primary component of operating our business. If we experience labor shortages or increased labor costs because of increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover rates, or increases in the federally-mandated or state-mandated minimum wage, change in exempt and non-exempt status, or other employee benefits costs (including costs associated with health insurance coverage or workers\u2019 compensation insurance), operating expenses could increase and our growth could be adversely affected. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a labor shortage and has also increased our labor cost as a result of limited applicants for manufacturing jobs requiring on-site work. Labor shortages and increased labor costs may continue to be realized as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe have a substantial number of hourly employees who are paid wage rates at or based on the applicable federal or state minimum wage and increases in the minimum wage will increase our labor costs. The federal minimum wage has been $7.25 per hour since July 24, 2009. Federally-mandated, state-mandated or locally-mandated minimum wages may be raised in the future. As of the date hereof, many states and the District of Columbia have set a minimum wage level higher than the federal minimum wage, including Colorado, where we employ the majority of our employees and minimum wage as of the date hereof is $12.32. We may be unable to increase our prices in order to pass future increased labor costs on to our customers, in which case our margins would be negatively affected.\nOur Financial Results May Be Adversely Impacted By The Failure To Successfully Execute Or Integrate Acquisitions, Divestitures And Joint Ventures.\nFrom time to time, we may evaluate potential acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures that align with our strategic objectives. The success of such activity depends, in part, upon our ability to identify suitable buyers, sellers or business partners; perform effective assessments prior to contract execution; negotiate contract terms; and, if applicable, obtain government approval. These activities may present certain financial, managerial, staffing and talent, and operational risks, including diversion of management\u2019s attention from existing core businesses; difficulties integrating or separating businesses from existing operations; and challenges presented by acquisitions or joint ventures which may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made. If the acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures are not successfully implemented or completed, there could be a negative impact on our results of operations.\nAnti-Takeover Provisions In Our Certificate Of Incorporation And Bylaws May Delay Or Prevent A Third Party Acquisition Of The Company, Which Could Decrease The Value Of Our Common Stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our Board of Directors. These provisions will:\n\u25cf\nlimit the business at special meetings to the purpose stated in the notice of the meeting;\n\u25cf\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which is preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede a takeover attempt and that the Board of Directors can create and issue without prior stockholder approval;\n\u25cf\nestablish advance notice requirements for submitting nominations for election to the Board of Directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting;\n\u25cf\nrequire the affirmative vote of the \u201cdisinterested\u201d holders of a majority of our common stock to approve certain business combinations involving an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d or its affiliates, unless either minimum price criteria and procedural requirements are met, or the transaction is approved by a majority of our \u201ccontinuing directors\u201d (known as \u201cfair price provisions\u201d).\nAlthough we believe all of these provisions will make a higher third-party bid more likely by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with the Board of Directors, these provisions will apply even if an initial offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and therefore could delay and/or prevent a deemed beneficial offer from being considered. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions, which may prevent a change of control or changes in our management that a stockholder might consider favorable. In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of us. Any delay or prevention of a change of control or change in management that stockholders might otherwise consider to be favorable could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nOur Common Stock Price May Be Volatile or May Decline Regardless of our Operating Performance.\nVolatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent you from being able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid for such shares. Many factors, which are outside our control, may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly, including those described elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and this Annual Report, as well as the following:\n\u25cf\nour operating and financial performance and prospects;\n\u25cf\nour quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry compared to market expectations;\n\u25cf\nconditions that impact demand at our stores and for our products;\n\u25cf\nfuture announcements concerning our business or our competitors\u2019 businesses;\n\u25cf\nthe public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC;\n\u25cf\nthe size of our public float, and the trading volume of our common stock;\n\u25cf\ncoverage by or changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or failure to meet their expectations;\n\u25cf\nmarket and industry perception of our success, or lack thereof, in pursuing our growth strategy;\n\u25cf\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u25cf\nchanges in laws or regulations which adversely affect our industry or us;\n\u25cf\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u25cf\nchanges in senior management or key personnel;\n\u25cf\nissuances, exchanges or sales, or expected issuances, exchanges or sales of our capital stock;\n\u25cf\nchanges in our dividend policy;\n\u25cf\nadverse resolution of new or pending litigation against us; and\n\u25cf\nchanges in general market, economic and political conditions in the United States and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from natural disasters, terrorist attacks, pandemics, public health crises, acts of war and responses to such events.\nAs a result, volatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent investors from being able to sell their common stock at or above the price they paid for such shares. These broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In addition, price volatility may be greater if the public float and trading volume of our common stock is low. As a result, you may suffer a loss on your investment.\nOur Quarterly Dividend has Been Suspended and Our Decision to Pay Dividends on our Common Stock in the Future is Subject to the Discretion of our Board of Directors.\nWe have in the past made a regular quarterly cash dividend to our common stockholders. However, the payment of future dividends on our common stock will be subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements, and on such other factors as our Board of Directors may in its discretion consider relevant and in the best long-term interest of stockholders. Additionally, any change in the level of our dividends or the suspension of the payment thereof could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The Board of Directors has suspended future quarterly dividends until the significant uncertainty of the current public health crisis and economic climate has passed and the Board of Directors determines that resumption of dividend payments is in the best interest of us and our stockholders. There is no assurance that we will resume dividend payments in the future, or if we do, at the same levels as declared in the past. For additional information on our payments of dividends, see \"Item 5. Market for Registrant\u2019s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities-Dividends\" under Part II of this Annual Report.\nRisks Related to the Economy\nThe Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (COVID-19) Pandemic Has, and May Continue to, Materially and Adversely Affect our Sales, Earnings, Financial Condition and Liquidity.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, and restrictions imposed by federal, state and local governments in response to the pandemic, have disrupted and will continue to disrupt our business. The pandemic has been, and we expect that it will continue to be, a serious threat to public health and the economic well-being of our franchisees and other customers, our employees and our suppliers. The COVID-19 pandemic has been, and may continue to cause a disruption to our business and potential associated financial impacts include, but are not limited to, lower net sales in markets affected by the pandemic, including potential material shifts in, and impacts to, demand, the inability of us or our franchisees to sell our products in stores to customers and further disruption to in-store sales, the delay of, and potential increased costs related to, inventory production and fulfillment and potential incremental costs associated with mitigating the effects of the pandemic, including increased raw materials, freight and logistics costs and other expenses. Federal, state and local authorities have recommended social distancing and have imposed quarantine and isolation measures on large portions of the population, including mandatory business closures for all non-essential businesses in certain jurisdictions. Many of our franchisees are located in retail locations classified as non-essential, and, as a result, traffic to our franchised stores and demand for our products have declined and our sales have materially decreased, sometimes to zero where retail stores have been required to close. Consequently, our earnings and liquidity have been, and we expect that they will continue to be, negatively impacted as a result. COVID-19 also impacted, and we expect that it will continue to impact, our supply chain, particularly as a result of mandatory shutdowns in locations where our suppliers are located. We have also experienced difficulty hiring and retaining manufacturing and store employees where on-site work is necessary. As a result, we have experienced and may continue to experience out-of-stocks and lost sales. We may be forced to close additional locations, or extend the closure of currently closed locations for reasons such as the health of our employees and further federal, state or local orders impacting our operations.\nDifficult macroeconomic conditions in our markets, such as further decreases in per capita income and level of disposable income, increased and prolonged unemployment or a further decline in consumer confidence as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as limited or significantly reduced points of access of our products, could continue to have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products. Under difficult economic conditions, consumers may continue to seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing purchases of our products or by shifting away from our premium products to lower-priced products offered by us or other companies, negatively impacting our net sales and margins. Softer consumer demand for our products, particularly in the United States, could reduce our profitability and could negatively affect our overall financial performance. A significant portion of our consolidated revenues are concentrated in the United States, where the COVID-19 pandemic impacts have been significant. Therefore, unfavorable macroeconomic conditions in the United States, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and any resulting recession or slowed economic growth, have had, and could continue to have, an outsized negative impact on us. In addition, difficult economic conditions may have a negative impact on our ability to access capital markets and other funding sources, on acceptable terms or at all, should we seek future financing. Additionally, we may have unexpected costs and liabilities; revenue and cash provided by operations may decline; macroeconomic conditions may continue to weaken; prolonged and severe levels of unemployment may negatively impact our consumers; and competitive pressures may increase, resulting in difficulty maintaining adequate liquidity, which would adversely impact our business, including by increasing our costs of future borrowing, if we are able to obtain additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us at all. Further, should the impacts of the pandemic and resulting performance adversely affect our ability to remain compliant with our covenants in our line of credit and absent a waiver or amendment from the lender, any outstanding borrowings on our line of credit may become immediately due.\nIn addition, the COVID-19 pandemic and related efforts to mitigate its spread, have impacted, and may continue to impact for the foreseeable future, customer traffic to our stores and our franchisees\u2019 stores. Many governmental authorities in the United States have required that restaurants and retailers close or cease onsite service, which has negatively impacted and we expect will continue to negatively impact in-store sales of our and our franchisees\u2019 products. Other locations have also implemented closures and/or modified their hours, either voluntarily or as a result of governmental orders or quarantines. Additionally, these and other governmental or societal impositions of restrictions on public gatherings, especially if prolonged in nature, will have adverse effects on in-store traffic and, in turn, our business. Even if the pandemic subsides, fear of re-occurrence, the emergence or spread of variants or the perceived risk of infection or health risk may adversely affect traffic to our and our franchisees\u2019 stores and, in turn, may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nMoreover, our operations could be disrupted by our employees or employees of our business partners, including our supply chain partners, being diagnosed with COVID-19 or suspected of having COVID-19 or other illnesses since this could require us or our business partners to quarantine some or all such employees or close and disinfect our or their facilities. If a significant percentage of our workforce or the workforce of our business partners are unable to work or if we or our business partners are required to close our or their manufacturing facilities, including because of illness or travel or government restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, our operations, including manufacturing and distribution capabilities, may be negatively impacted, potentially materially adversely affecting our business, liquidity, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition to the foregoing, we have experienced, or are likely to experience, the following adverse impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic:\n\u25cf\nA large number of franchise store closures, with no assurance that franchise stores have the liquidity to maintain or resume operations when it is safe and they are permitted to do so.\n\u25cf We may not achieve the anticipated potential benefits of the strategic alliance and ecommerce agreements with Edible.\n\u25cf\n\u201cShelter in place\u201d and other similar mandated or suggested isolation protocols, which have disrupted, and could continue to disrupt, our Company-owned stores and franchisees\u2019 stores via store closures or reduced operating hours and decreased retail traffic.\n\u25cf\nAn increase in costs associated with maintaining a safe workplace until at least such time as the public health crisis subsides.\n\u25cf\nAll of our Company-owned stores have been closed or are operating under extreme restrictions.\n\u25cf\nOur suppliers have faced similar impacts to their business.\n\u25cf\nWe have incurred approximately $1.3 million of bad debt expense related to uncollectable accounts and we may continue to experience the failure of our customers to pay amounts owed to us on time, or at all, particularly if such customers are significantly impacted by COVID-19.\n\u25cf\nThe impact of the pandemic on the economies and financial markets of the countries and regions in which we operate, including a potential global recession, a decline in consumer confidence and spending, or a further increase in unemployment levels, has resulted, and could continue to result, in consumers having less disposable income and, in turn, decreased sales of our products.\n\u25cf\nThere may not be demand for the inventory we have on hand, which may spoil or expire before we are able to sell it.\n\u25cf\nWe incurred $476,000 of goodwill and intangible asset impairment expense and we may be unable to realize the expected benefits of our tangible and intangible assets.\n\u25cf\nOur success in attempting to reduce operating costs and conserve cash.\n\u25cf\nOur franchisees\u2019 inability to obtain rent and other relief from landlords with respect to closed stores, which may involve litigation or other disruptions.\n\u25cf\nThe risk that even after the pandemic has initially subsided, fear of COVID-19 re-occurrence could cause customers to avoid public places where our stores and those of our franchisees are located such as malls and outlets.\n\u25cf\nWe may be required to revise certain accounting estimates and judgments such as, but not limited to, those related to the valuation of long-lived assets and deferred tax assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing and the extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our business and financial results will also depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the pandemic within the markets in which we operate, the success of vaccination efforts including the rate of vaccination and effectiveness, related prolonged weakening of economic or other negative conditions, such as a recession or slowed economic growth in our markets, which could impact consumer confidence and spending and actions that may be taken by governmental authorities to contain the pandemic or to mitigate its impact, all of which are highly uncertain and make it difficult to forecast any effects on our results of operations for FY 2022 and in subsequent years. The nature of the COVID-19 pandemic makes it impossible to predict how our business and operations will be affected in the near and long term.\nGeneral Economic Conditions Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on our Business, Results of Operations and Liquidity or our Franchisees, with Adverse Consequences to Us.\nConsumer purchases of discretionary items, including our products, generally decline during weak economic periods, such as the current economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and other periods where disposable income is adversely affected. Our performance is subject to factors that affect worldwide economic conditions, including employment, consumer debt, reductions in net worth based on severe market declines, residential real estate and mortgage markets, taxation, fuel and energy prices, interest rates, consumer confidence, public health, value of the U.S. dollar versus foreign currencies and other macroeconomic factors. These factors may cause consumers to purchase products from lower priced competitors or to defer purchases of discretionary products altogether.\nEconomic weakness could have a material effect on our results of operations, liquidity and capital resources. It could also impact our ability to fund growth and/or result in us becoming more reliant on external financing, the availability and terms of which may be uncertain. In addition, a weak economic environment may exacerbate the other risks noted below.\nWe rely in part on our franchisees and the manner in which they operate their stores to develop and promote our business. It is possible, especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic that additional franchisees could file for bankruptcy, become delinquent in their payments to us, or simply shut down which could have a significant adverse impact on our business due to loss or delay in payments of royalties, contributions to our marketing fund and other fees.\nAlthough we have developed criteria to evaluate and screen prospective developers and franchisees, we cannot be certain that the developers and franchisees we select will have the business acumen or financial resources necessary to open and operate successful franchises in their franchise areas, and state franchise laws may limit our ability to terminate or modify these franchise arrangements. Moreover, franchisees may not successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements, or may not hire and train qualified managers and other store personnel. The failure of developers and franchisees to open and operate franchises successfully could have a material adverse effect on us, our reputation, our brand and our ability to attract prospective franchisees and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks related to Our Franchisees\nThe Financial Performance of Our Franchisees Can Negatively Impact Our Business.\nOur financial results are dependent in part upon the operational and financial success of our franchisees. We receive royalties, franchise fees, contributions to our marketing fund, and other fees from our franchisees. We have established operational standards and guidelines for our franchisees; however, we have limited control over how our franchisees\u2019 businesses are run. While we are responsible for ensuring the success of our entire system of stores and for taking a longer-term view with respect to system improvements, our franchisees have individual business strategies and objectives, which might conflict with our interests. Our franchisees may not be able to secure adequate financing to open or continue operating their Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory stores or U-Swirl caf\u00e9s. If they incur too much debt or if economic or sales trends deteriorate such that they are unable to repay existing debt, our franchisees could experience financial distress or even bankruptcy. If a significant number of franchisees become financially distressed, it could harm our operating results through reduced royalty revenues and the impact on our profitability could be greater than the percentage decrease in the royalty revenues. Closure of franchised stores was higher during FY 2021 and could continue to exceed levels experienced in recent years, especially as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This would reduce our royalty revenues and could negatively impact margins, since we may not be able to reduce fixed costs which we continue to incur.\nWe Have Limited Control with Respect to the Operations of Our Franchisees, Which Could Have a Negative Impact on Our Business.\nFranchisees are independent business operators and are not our employees, and we do not exercise control over the day-to-day operations of their stores. We provide training and support to franchisees, and set and monitor operational standards, but the quality of franchised stores may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control. Consequently, franchisees may not successfully operate stores in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements, or may not hire and train qualified managers and other store personnel. If franchisees do not operate to our expectations, our image and reputation, and the image and reputation of other franchisees, may suffer materially and system-wide sales could decline significantly, which would reduce our royalty revenues, and the impact on profitability could be greater than the percentage decrease in royalties and fees.\nA Significant Shift by Franchisees from Company-Manufactured Products to Products Produced by Third Parties Could Adversely Affect Our Operations.\nIn FY 2021, approximately 49% of franchised stores' revenues are generated by sales of products manufactured by and purchased from us, 48% by sales of products made in the stores with ingredients purchased from us or approved suppliers and 3% by sales of products purchased from approved suppliers for resale in the stores. Franchisees' sales of products manufactured by us generate higher revenues to us than sales of store-made or other products. We have seen a significant increase in system-wide sales of store-made and other products, which has led to a decrease in purchases from us and had an adverse effect on our revenues. If this trend continues, it could further adversely affect our total revenues and results of operations. Such a decrease could result from franchisees' decisions to sell more store-made products or products purchased from approved third party suppliers.\nRisks Related to Our Supply Chain\nThe Availability and Price of Principal Ingredients Used in Our Products Are Subject to Factors Beyond Our Control.\nSeveral of the principal ingredients used in our products, including chocolate and nuts, are subject to significant price fluctuations. Although cocoa beans, the primary raw material used in the production of chocolate, are grown commercially in Africa, Brazil and several other countries around the world, cocoa beans are traded in the commodities market, and their supply and price are subject to volatility. We believe our principal chocolate supplier purchases most of its beans at negotiated prices from African growers, often at a premium to commodity prices. The supply and price of cocoa beans, and in turn of chocolate, are affected by many factors, including monetary fluctuations and economic, political and weather conditions in countries in which cocoa beans are grown. We purchase most of our nut meats from domestic suppliers who procure their products from growers around the world. The price and supply of nuts are also affected by many factors, including weather conditions in the various regions in which the nuts we use are grown. Although we often enter into purchase contracts for these products, significant or prolonged increases in the prices of chocolate or of one or more types of nuts, or the unavailability of adequate supplies of chocolate or nuts of the quality sought by us, could have a material adverse effect on us and our results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in pricing and supply disruptions to our supply chain and has also impacted our ability to offset such disruptions through increased prices to our customers. Increases in ingredient costs or supply chain disruptions may continue to be realized as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDisruption To Our Manufacturing Operations Or Supply Chain Could Impair Our Ability To Produce Or Deliver Finished Products, Resulting In A Negative Impact On Our Results of Operations.\nAll of our manufacturing operations are located in Durango, Colorado. Disruption to our manufacturing operations or our supply chain could result from a number of factors, including: natural disaster, pandemic, outbreak of disease, weather, fire or explosion, terrorism or other acts of violence, labor strikes or other labor activities, unavailability of raw or packaging materials, and operational and/or financial instability of key suppliers and other vendors or service providers. We believe that we take adequate precautions to mitigate the impact of possible disruptions. We have strategies and plans in place to manage disruptive events if they were to occur. However, if we are unable, or find that it is not financially feasible, to effectively plan for or mitigate the potential impacts of such disruptive events on our manufacturing operations or supply chain, our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted. Local State of Colorado health orders issued in response to COVID-19 have impacted, and are likely to continue to impact, our manufacturing operations. Specifically, social distancing recommendations and requirements have had an impact on how many employees can be engaged in production activities. If these requirements are in place for an extended period of time we may realize additional constraints upon production capacity.", "PERMNO": 10044, "SIC": 2060, "TIC": "RMCF"}
