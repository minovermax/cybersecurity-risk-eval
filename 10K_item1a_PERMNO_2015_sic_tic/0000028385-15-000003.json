{"cik": "28385", "company": "DTE Electric Co", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThere are various risks associated with the operations of DTE Electric. To provide a framework to understand the operating environment of the Company, we are providing a brief explanation of the more significant risks associated with our business. Although we have tried to identify and discuss key risk factors, others could emerge in the future. Each of the following risks could affect our performance.\nWe are subject to rate regulation. Our electric rates are set by the MPSC and the FERC and cannot be changed without regulatory authorization. We may be negatively impacted by new regulations or interpretations by the MPSC, the FERC or other regulatory bodies. Our ability to recover costs may be impacted by the time lag between the incurrence of costs and the recovery of the costs in customers' rates. Our regulators also may decide to disallow recovery of certain costs in customers' rates if they determine that those costs do not meet the standards for recovery under our governing laws and regulations. We typically self-implement base rate changes six months after rate case filings in accordance with Michigan law. However, if the final rates authorized by our regulators in the final rate order are lower than the amounts we collected during the self-implementation period, we must refund the difference with interest. Our regulators may also disagree with our rate calculations under the various mechanisms that are intended to mitigate the risk of certain aspects of our business. If we cannot agree with our regulators on an appropriate reconciliation of those mechanisms, it may impact our ability to recover certain costs through our customer rates. Our regulators may also decide to eliminate these mechanisms in future rate cases, which may make it more difficult for us to recover our costs in the rates we charge customers. We cannot predict what rates the MPSC will authorize in future rate cases. New legislation, regulations or interpretations could change how our business operates, impact our ability to recover costs through rates or require us to incur additional expenses.\nChanges to Michigan's electric Customer Choice program could negatively impact our financial performance. The State of Michigan currently experiences a hybrid market, where the MPSC continues to regulate electric rates for our customers, while alternative electric suppliers charge market-based rates. MPSC rate orders and energy legislation enacted by the State of Michigan in 2008 have placed a 10% cap on the total potential retail access related migration. However, even with the legislated 10% cap on participation, there continues to be legislative and financial risk associated with the electric Customer Choice program. Electric retail access migration is sensitive to market price and full service electric price changes. We are required under current regulation to provide full service to retail access customers that choose to return, potentially resulting in the need for additional generating capacity.\nThe MISO regional energy market, including the State of Michigan, is expected to face capacity constraints beginning in 2016 due primarily to the retirement of coal-fired generation caused by increasingly stringent environmental requirements. Significant investment in new natural gas-fired generation and renewables will be required. Under the current regulatory structure, retail access customers do not fund capacity costs potentially impacting electric supply reliability and utility customer affordability.\nEnvironmental laws and liability may be costly. We are subject to and affected by numerous environmental regulations. These regulations govern air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharge and disposal of solid and hazardous waste. Compliance with these regulations can significantly increase capital spending, operating expenses and plant down times and can negatively affect the affordability of the rates we charge to our customers.\nUncertainty around future environmental regulations creates difficulty planning long-term capital projects in our generation fleet. These laws and regulations require us to seek a variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections and other regulatory approvals. We could be required to install expensive pollution control measures or limit or cease activities, including the retirement of certain generating plants, based on these regulations. Additionally, we may become a responsible party for environmental cleanup at sites identified by a regulatory body. We cannot predict with certainty the amount and timing of future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating clean-up costs. There is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on potentially responsible parties.\nWe may also incur liabilities as a result of potential future requirements to address climate change issues. Proposals for voluntary initiatives and mandatory controls are being discussed both in the United States and worldwide to reduce greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, a by-product of burning fossil fuels. If increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions are implemented, the operations of our fossil-fuel generation assets may be significantly impacted. Since there can be no assurances that environmental costs may be recovered through the regulatory process, our financial performance may be negatively impacted as a result of environmental matters.\nOperation of a nuclear facility subjects us to risk. Ownership of an operating nuclear generating plant subjects us to significant additional risks. These risks include, among others, plant security, environmental regulation and remediation, changes in federal nuclear regulation and operational factors that can significantly impact the performance and cost of operating a nuclear facility. While we maintain insurance for various nuclear-related risks, there can be no assurances that such insurance will be sufficient to cover our costs in the event of an accident or business interruption at our nuclear generating plant, which may affect our financial performance. In addition, while we have a nuclear decommissioning trust fund to finance the decommissioning of our nuclear generating plant, there can be no assurances that such fund will be sufficient to fund the cost of decommissioning.\nThe supply and/or price of energy commodities and/or related services may impact our financial results. We are dependent on coal for much of our electrical generating capacity. Price fluctuations, fuel supply disruptions and changes in transportation costs could have a negative impact on the amounts we charge our utility customers for electricity. We have hedging strategies and regulatory recovery mechanisms in place to mitigate some of the negative fluctuations in commodity supply prices, but there can be no assurances that our financial performance will not be negatively impacted by price fluctuations.\nThe supply and/or price of other industrial raw and finished inputs and/or related services may impact our financial results. We are dependent on supplies of certain commodities, such as copper and limestone, among others, and industrial materials and services in order to maintain day-to-day operations and maintenance of our facilities. Price fluctuations or supply interruptions for these commodities and other items could have a negative impact on the amounts we charge our customers for our products.\nAdverse changes in our credit ratings may negatively affect us. Regional and national economic conditions, increased scrutiny of the energy industry and regulatory changes, as well as changes in our economic performance, could result in credit agencies reexamining our credit rating. While credit ratings reflect the opinions of the credit agencies issuing such ratings and may not necessarily reflect actual performance, a downgrade in our credit rating below investment grade could restrict or discontinue our ability to access capital markets and could result in an increase in our borrowing costs, a reduced level of capital expenditures and could impact future earnings and cash flows. In addition, a reduction in our credit rating may require us to post collateral related to various physical or financially settled contracts for the purchase of energy-related commodities, products and services, which could impact our liquidity.\nPoor investment performance of pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets and other factors impacting benefit plan costs could unfavorably impact our liquidity and results of operations. Our costs of providing non-contributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans, future government regulation, and our required or voluntary contributions made to the plans. The performance of the debt and equity markets affects the value of assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under our plans. We have significant benefit obligations and hold significant assets in trust to satisfy these obligations. These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below our projected return rates. A decline in the market value of the pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets will increase the funding requirements under our pension and other postretirement benefit plans if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in the foreseeable future. Additionally, our pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. As interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, resulting in increasing benefit expense and funding requirements. Also, if future increases in pension and other postretirement benefit costs as a result of reduced plan assets are not recoverable from our customers, the results of operations and financial position of our company could be negatively affected. Without sustained growth in the plan investments over time to increase the value of our plan assets, we could be required to fund our plans with significant amounts of cash. Such cash funding obligations could have a material impact on our cash flows, financial position, or results of operations.\nOur ability to access capital markets is important. Our ability to access capital markets is important to operate our businesses and to fund capital investments. Turmoil in credit markets may constrain our ability to issue new debt, including commercial paper, and refinance existing debt at reasonable interest rates. In addition, the level of borrowing by other energy companies and the market as a whole could limit our access to capital markets. Our long term revolving credit facility does not expire until 2018, but we regularly access capital markets to refinance existing debt or fund new projects, and we cannot predict the pricing or demand for those future transactions.\nConstruction and capital improvements to our power facilities subject us to risk. We are managing ongoing and planning future significant construction and capital improvement projects at multiple power generation and distribution facilities. Many factors that could cause delays or increased prices for these complex projects are beyond our control, including the cost of materials and labor, subcontractor performance, timing and issuance of necessary permits, construction disputes and weather conditions. Failure to complete these projects on schedule and on budget for any reason could adversely affect our financial performance and operations at the affected facilities.\nWeather significantly affects operations. Deviations from normal hot and cold weather conditions affect our earnings and cash flow. Mild temperatures can result in decreased utilization of our assets, lowering income and cash flow. Ice storms, tornadoes, or high winds can damage the electric distribution system infrastructure and power generation facilities and require us to perform emergency repairs and incur material unplanned expenses. The expenses of storm restoration efforts may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process.\nUnplanned power plant outages may be costly. Unforeseen maintenance may be required to safely produce electricity or comply with environmental regulations. As a result of unforeseen maintenance, we may be required to make spot market purchases of electricity that exceed our costs of generation. Our financial performance may be negatively affected if we are unable to recover such increased costs.\nRenewable portfolio standards and energy efficiency programs may affect our business. We are subject to existing Michigan and potential future federal legislation and regulation requiring us to secure sources of renewable energy. We expect to comply with the existing state legislation, but we do not know what requirements may be added by federal legislation. In addition, there could be additional state requirements increasing the percentage of power required to be provided by renewable energy sources. We cannot predict the financial impact or costs associated with complying with potential future legislation and regulations. Compliance with these requirements can significantly increase capital expenditures and operating expenses and can negatively affect the affordability of the rates we charge to our customers.\nWe are also required by Michigan legislation to implement energy efficiency measures and provide energy efficiency customer awareness and education programs. These requirements necessitate expenditures and implementation of these programs creates the risk of reducing our revenues as customers decrease their energy usage. We cannot predict how these programs will impact our business and future operating results.\nRegional and national economic conditions can have an unfavorable impact on us. Our business follows the economic cycles of the customers we serve and the credit risk of counterparties we do business with. Should national or regional economic conditions deteriorate, reduced volumes of electricity, collections of accounts receivable, and reductions in federal and state energy assistance funding, and potentially higher levels of stolen electricity could result in decreased earnings and cash flow.\nThreats of terrorism or cyber-attacks could affect our business. We may be threatened by problems such as computer viruses or terrorism that may disrupt our operations and could harm our operating results. Our industry requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure. Despite our implementation of security measures, all of our technology systems are vulnerable to disability or failures due to hacking, viruses, acts of war or terrorism and other causes. If our information technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely way, we might be unable to fulfill critical business functions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nIn addition, our generation plants and electrical distribution facilities in particular may be targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt our ability to produce or distribute some portion of our energy products. We have increased security as a result of past events and we may be required by our regulators or by the future terrorist threat environment to make investments in security that we cannot currently predict.\nFailure to maintain the security of personally identifiable information could adversely affect us. In connection with our business we collect and retain personally identifiable information of our customers, shareholders and employees. Our customers, shareholders and employees expect that we will adequately protect their personal information, and the United States regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding. A significant theft, loss or fraudulent use of customer, shareholder, employee or DTE Electric data by cybercrime or otherwise could adversely impact our reputation and could result in significant costs, fines and litigation.\nFailure to attract and retain key executive officers and other skilled professional and technical employees could have an adverse effect on our operations. Our business is dependent on our ability to attract and retain skilled employees. Competition for skilled employees in some areas is high and the inability to attract and retain these employees could adversely affect our business and future operating results. In addition, we have an aging utility workforce and the failure of a successful transfer of knowledge and expertise could negatively impact our operations.\nA work interruption may adversely affect us. There are several bargaining units for the Company's approximately 2,600 represented employees. The majority of represented employees are under contracts that expire in 2016 and 2017. A union choosing to strike would have an impact on our business. We are unable to predict the effect a work stoppage would have on our costs of operation and financial performance.\nThe Company's businesses have safety risks. The Company's electric distribution system, power plants, wind energy equipment and other facilities could be involved in incidents that result in injury or property loss to employees, customers, or the public. Although we have insurance coverage for many potential incidents, depending upon the nature and severity of any incident, the Company could experience financial loss, damage to its reputation, and negative consequences from regulatory agencies or other public authorities.\nWe may not be fully covered by insurance. We have a comprehensive insurance program in place to provide coverage for various types of risks, including catastrophic damage as a result of acts of God, terrorism or a combination of other significant unforeseen events that could impact our operations. Economic losses might not be covered in full by insurance or our insurers may be unable to meet contractual obligations.", "PERMNO": 11674, "SIC": 4911, "TIC": "DTE1"}
