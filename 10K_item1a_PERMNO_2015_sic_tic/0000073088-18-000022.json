RISK FACTORS -\nYou should carefully consider the risk factors described below, as well as all other information available to you, before making an investment in our common stock or other securities.\nWe are subject to potential unfavorable state and federal regulatory outcomes. To the extent our incurred costs are deemed imprudent by the applicable regulatory commissions or certain regulatory mechanisms are not available, we may not recover some of our costs, which could adversely impact our results of operations and liquidity.\nOur profitability is dependent on our ability to recover the costs of providing energy and utility services to our customers and earn a return on our capital investment in our utility operations. We provide service at rates established by several regulatory commissions. These rates are generally set based on an analysis of our costs incurred in a historical test year. In addition, each regulatory commission sets rates based in part upon their acceptance of an allocated share of total utility costs. When commissions adopt different methods to calculate inter-jurisdictional cost allocations, some costs may not be recovered. Thus, the rates we are allowed to charge may or may not match our costs at any given time. While rate regulation is premised on providing a reasonable opportunity to earn a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, there can be no assurance that the applicable regulatory commission will judge all of our costs to have been prudently incurred or that the regulatory process in which rates are determined will always result in rates that will produce full recovery of such costs. In addition to rate cases, our cost tracking mechanisms are a significant component of how we recover our costs. Historically, our wholesale costs for electricity and natural gas supply were recovered through various pass-through cost tracking mechanisms in each of the states we serve.\nMontana\nWe have received several unfavorable regulatory rulings in Montana, including:\n\u2022In January 2018, the MPSC issued an order in our 2017 property tax tracker filing reducing our recovery of Montana property taxes between general rate filings by applying an alternate allocation methodology. This results in a lower property tax allocation to our Montana electric retail customers and a higher property tax allocation to FERC transmission customers (we do not have a property tax tracker for FERC jurisdictional purposes).\n\u2022In 2017, the MPSC revised our QF tariff for standard QF rates for small QFs (3 MW or less) to establish a maximum contract length of 15 years and substantially lowering the rate for future QF contracts. In this order, the MPSC also applied the 15-year contract term to our future owned and contracted electric supply resources. As a result, we terminated our competitive solicitation process to determine the lowest-cost / least-risk approach for addressing our intermittent capacity and reserve margin needs in Montana. This order may have a significant impact on our approach to meet our portfolio needs. We continue to evaluate the impact of this decision.\n\u2022In 2016, the MPSC disallowed replacement power costs from a 2013 outage at Colstrip Unit 4 requested in our electric tracker filings. We appealed the MPSC\u2019s decision regarding the disallowance of Colstrip Unit 4 costs in Montana District Court, arguing that these decisions were arbitrary and capricious, and violated Montana law.\n\u2022In October 2015, the MPSC issued an order eliminating the lost revenue adjustment mechanism. This mechanism was established in 2005 as a component of an approved energy efficiency program, by which we recovered on an after-the-fact basis our fixed costs that would otherwise have been collected in the kWh sales lost due to energy efficiency programs through our supply tracker. Recovery of lost revenues was terminated, prospectively, effective December 1, 2015.\n\u2022In October 2013, the MPSC concluded that costs associated with a 2012 outage at DGGS were imprudently incurred, and disallowed recovery.\nWe have two significant dockets currently in process with the MPSC. The MPSC advocated revising the statute that provided for mandatory recovery of our prudently incurred electric supply costs, and in April 2017, the Montana legislature passed HB 193, amending the statute. In July 2017, we filed a proposed electric PCCAM. Following the submission of intervenor testimony, the MPSC identified additional issues and established a revised procedural schedule with a hearing scheduled to begin May 31, 2018. We cannot guarantee how the MPSC may apply the statute in establishing a revised mechanism. To the extent our energy supply costs are deemed imprudent by the applicable state regulatory commissions, or the passage of HB 193 reduces our recovery or the timeliness of cash flows, the revised mechanism could adversely impact our\nresults of operations and cash flows. The MPSC also established a docket regarding the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and we expect to submit a filing regarding the customer benefit during the first quarter of 2018. We cannot predict how the MPSC may address this filing.\nFERC & Other Regulation\nIn our regulatory filings related to DGGS, we proposed an allocation of approximately 80% of costs to retail customers subject to the MPSC's jurisdiction and approximately 20% allocated to wholesale customers subject to FERC's jurisdiction. In March 2012, the MPSC's final order approved using our proposed cost allocation methodology, but requires us to complete a study of the relative contribution of retail and wholesale customers to regulation capacity needs. The results of this study may be used in determining future cost allocations between retail and wholesale customers. However, there is no assurance that both the MPSC and FERC will agree on the results of this study, which could result in an inability to fully recover our costs in a future electric general rate filing.\nWe must also comply with established reliability standards and requirements, which apply to the NERC functions in both the MRO for our South Dakota operations and WECC for our Montana operations. The FERC, NERC, or a regional reliability organization may assess penalties against any responsible entity that violates their rules, regulations or standards. Violations may be discovered through various means, including self-certification, self-reporting, compliance investigations, audits, periodic data submissions, exception reporting, and complaints. Penalties for the most severe violations can reach as high as approximately $1.2 million per violation, per day. If a serious reliability incident or other incidence of noncompliance did occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating and financial results.\nWe are also subject to changing federal and state laws and regulations. Congress and state legislatures may enact legislation that adversely affects our operations and financial results.\nWe are subject to existing, and potential future, federal and state legislation. In the planning and management of our operations, we must address the effects of legislation within a regulatory framework. Federal and state laws can significantly impact our operations, whether it is new or revised statutes directly affecting the electric and gas industry, or other issues such as taxes.\nIn addition, new or revised statutes can also materially affect our operations through impacting existing regulations or requiring new regulations. These changes are ongoing, and we cannot predict the future course of changes or the ultimate effect that this changing environment will have on us. Changes in laws, and the resulting regulations and tariffs and how they are implemented and interpreted, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur ability to invest in additional generation is impacted by PURPA, which requires electric utilities, with few exceptions, to purchase energy and capacity from independent power producers that are QFs. Our requirements to procure power from these sources could impact our ability to make generation investments depending upon the number and size of QF contracts we ultimately enter into. The cost to procure power from these QFs may not be a cost effective resource for customers, or the type of generation resource needed, resulting in increased supply costs.\nOn June 22, 2016, the Securing America\u2019s Future Energy: Protecting our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act (SAFE PIPES Act), was signed into law. The law prioritized the Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) completion of outstanding regulations and proposed regulations to safety standards for natural gas transmission and gathering pipelines. The long-anticipated proposal could impose significant regulatory requirements for additional miles of natural gas pipeline, including pipelines constructed prior to 1970, which were previously exempt from PHMSA regulations related to pressure testing. It would also create a new \"Moderate Consequence Area\" category to expand safety protocols to pipelines in moderately populated areas. The rule also would codify the Integrity Verification Process (IVP) which is a process that will require companies to have reliable, traceable, verifiable, and complete records for pipelines in certain areas. The rule would establish a deadline for IVP completion that we will be required to meet. Costs incurred to comply with the proposed regulations may be material.\nWe are subject to extensive and changing environmental laws and regulations and potential environmental liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive laws and regulations imposed by federal, state, and local government authorities in the ordinary course of operations with regard to the environment, including environmental laws and regulations relating to air and water quality, protection of natural resources, migratory birds and other wildlife, solid waste disposal, coal ash and other\nenvironmental considerations. We believe that we are in compliance with environmental regulatory requirements; however, possible future developments, such as more stringent environmental laws and regulations, and the timing of future enforcement proceedings that may be taken by environmental authorities, could affect our costs and the manner in which we conduct our business and could require us to make substantial additional capital expenditures or abandon certain projects.\nIn October 2015, the EPA published standards for states to implement to control greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from existing electric generating units. These standards are referred to as the Clean Power Plan (CPP). We, along with a number of states and other parties, filed lawsuits against the EPA standards. The EPA proposed to repeal the CPP in October 2017, and in December 2017, issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR), soliciting information on systems of emission reduction that comply with EPA\u2019s interpretation of the Clean Air Act, for a possible replacement of the CPP. In light of the proposed repeal, and the ANPR, the future of the CPP regulations and associated guidance is uncertain. However, if the CPP is not repealed, survives the pending legal challenges and is implemented as written or if a replacement to the CPP is adopted with similar requirements, it could result in significant additional compliance costs that would affect our future results of operations and financial position if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates. Due to the pending litigation, the proposed repeal of the CPP, the ANPR, and the uncertainties in the state approaches, the ultimate timing and impact of the CPP or other GHG regulations on our operations cannot be determined with certainty at this time. Complying with the CO2 emission performance standards, and with other future environmental rules, may make it economically impractical to continue operating all or a portion of our jointly owned facilities or for individual owners to participate in their proportionate ownership of the coal-fired generating units. This could lead to significant impacts to customer rates for recovery of plant improvements and / or closure related costs and costs to procure replacement power. In addition, these changes could impact system reliability due to changes in generation sources.\nMany of these environmental laws and regulations provide for substantial civil and criminal fines for noncompliance which, if imposed, could result in material costs or liabilities. In addition, there is a risk of environmental damages claims from private parties or government entities. We may be required to make significant expenditures in connection with the investigation and remediation of alleged or actual spills, personal injury or property damage claims, and the repair, upgrade or expansion of our facilities to meet future requirements and obligations under environmental laws.\nTo the extent that costs exceed our estimated environmental liabilities, or we are not successful in recovering remediation costs or costs to comply with the proposed or any future changes in rules or regulations, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected.\nWeather and weather patterns, including normal seasonal and quarterly fluctuations of weather, as well as extreme weather events that might be associated with climate change, could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity.\nOur electric and natural gas utility business is seasonal, and weather patterns can have a material impact on our financial performance. Demand for electricity and natural gas is often greater in the summer and winter months associated with cooling and heating. Because natural gas is heavily used for residential and commercial heating, the demand for this product depends heavily upon weather patterns throughout our market areas, and a significant amount of natural gas revenues are recognized in the first and fourth quarters related to the heating season. Accordingly, our operations have historically generated less revenue and income when weather conditions are milder in the winter and cooler in the summer. Unusually mild winters or cool summers could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. In addition, exceptionally hot summer weather or unusually cold winter weather could add significantly to working capital needs to fund higher than normal supply purchases to meet customer demand for electricity and natural gas. Our sensitivity to weather volatility is significant due to the absence of regulatory mechanisms, such as those authorizing revenue decoupling, lost margin recovery, and other innovative rate designs.\nSevere weather impacts, including but not limited to, thunderstorms, high winds, wildfires, tornadoes and snow or ice storms can disrupt energy generation, transmission and distribution. We derive a significant portion of our energy supply from hydroelectric facilities, and the availability of water can significantly affect operations. Higher temperatures may decrease the Montana snowpack and impact the timing of run-off and may require us to purchase replacement power. Dry conditions also increase the threat of wildfires, which could threaten our communities and electric distribution and transmission lines and facilities. In addition, wildfires alleged to have been caused by our system could expose us to substantial property damage and other claims. Any damage caused as a result of wildfires could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThere is also a concern that the physical risks of climate change could include changes in weather conditions, such as changes in the amount or type of precipitation and extreme weather events. Climate change and the costs that may be associated with its impacts have the potential to affect our business in many ways, including increasing the cost incurred in\nproviding electricity and natural gas, impacting the demand for and consumption of electricity and natural gas (due to change in both costs and weather patterns), and affecting the economic health of the regions in which we operate. Extreme weather conditions creating high energy demand on our own and/or other systems may raise market prices as we buy short-term energy to serve our own system. To the extent the frequency of extreme weather events increase, this could increase our cost of providing service. In addition, we may not recover all costs related to mitigating these physical and financial risks.\nOur revenues, results of operations and financial condition are impacted by customer growth and usage in our service territories and may fluctuate with current economic conditions or response to price increases. We are also impacted by market conditions outside of our service territories related to demand for transmission capacity and wholesale electric pricing.\nOur revenues, results of operations and financial condition are impacted by customer growth and usage, which can be impacted by a number of factors, including the voluntary reduction of consumption of electricity and natural gas by our customers in response to increases in prices and demand-side management programs, economic conditions impacting decreases in their disposable income, and the use of distributed generation resources or other emerging technologies for electricity. Advances in distributed generation technologies that produce power, including fuel cells, micro-turbines, wind turbines and solar cells, may reduce the cost of alternative methods of producing power to a level competitive with central power station electric production. Customer-owned generation itself reduces the amount of electricity purchased from utilities and may have the effect of increasing rates generally and increasing rates for customers who do not own generation, unless retail rates are designed to share the costs of the distribution grid across all customers that benefit from their use. Such developments could affect the price of energy, could affect energy deliveries as customer-owned generation becomes more cost-effective, could require further improvements to our distribution systems to address changing load demands and could make portions of our electric system power supply and transmission and/or distribution facilities obsolete prior to the end of their useful lives. Such technologies could also result in further declines in commodity prices or demand for delivered energy.\nDecreasing use per customer (driven, for example, by appliance and lighting efficiency) and the availability of cost-effective distributed generation, both put downward pressure on load growth. Our resource plan includes an expected load growth assumption of 0.8 percent annually, which reflects low customer and usage increases, offset in part by these efficiency measures. Reductions in usage, attributable to various factors could materially affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows through, among other things, reduced operating revenues, increased operating and maintenance expenses, and increased capital expenditures, as well as potential asset impairment charges or accelerated depreciation and decommissioning expenses over shortened remaining asset useful lives.\nDemand for our Montana transmission capacity fluctuates with regional demand, fuel prices and weather related conditions. The levels of wholesale sales depend on the wholesale market price, market participants, transmission availability and the availability of generation, among other factors. Declines in wholesale market price, availability of generation, transmission constraints in the wholesale markets, or low wholesale demand could reduce wholesale sales. These events could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nCyber and physical attacks, threats of terrorism and catastrophic events that could result from terrorism, or individuals and/or groups attempting to disrupt our business, or the businesses of third parties, may affect our operations in unpredictable ways and could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations.\nWe are subject to the potentially adverse operating and financial effects of terrorist acts and threats, as well as cyber (such as hacking and viruses) and physical security breaches and other disruptive activities of individuals or groups. Our generation, transmission and distribution facilities are deemed critical infrastructure and provide the framework for our service infrastructure. These assets and the information technology systems on which they depend could be direct targets of, or indirectly affected by, cyber attacks and other disruptive activities, including cyber attacks and other disruptive activities on third party facilities that are interconnected to us through the regional transmission grid or natural gas pipeline infrastructure. Any significant interruption of these assets or systems could prevent us from fulfilling our critical business functions including delivering energy to our customers, and sensitive, confidential and other data could be compromised.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems to operate our critical infrastructure, engage in asset management activities, and process, transmit and store electronic information including customer and employee information. Further, our infrastructure, networks and systems are interconnected to external networks and neighboring critical infrastructure systems. Security breaches could lead to system disruptions, generating facility shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Cyber or physical attacks, terrorist acts, or disruptive activities could harm our business by limiting our ability to generate, purchase or transmit power and by delaying the development and construction of new facilities and capital improvements to existing facilities.\nIn addition, our information systems and those of our third-party vendors contain confidential information, including information about customers and employees. A data breach involving theft, improper disclosure, or other unauthorized access to or acquisition of confidential information could subject us to penalties for violation of applicable privacy laws, claims by third parties, and enforcement actions by government agencies. It could also reduce the value of proprietary information, and harm our reputation.\nSecurity threats continue to evolve and adapt. We and our third-party vendors have been subject to, and will likely continue to be subject to, attempts to gain unauthorized access to systems, or confidential data, or to disrupt operations. None of these attempts has individually or in aggregate resulted in a security incident with a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Despite implementation of security and control measures, there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevent the unauthorized access of our systems and data, or the disruption of our operations, either of which could have a material impact.\nThese events, and governmental actions in response, could result in a material decrease in revenues and significant additional costs to repair and insure assets, and could adversely affect our operations by contributing to the disruption of supplies and markets for electricity, natural gas, oil and other fuels. These events could also impair our ability to raise capital by contributing to financial instability and reduced economic activity.\nOur electric and natural gas transmission and distribution operations involve numerous activities that may result in accidents, wildfires, and other operating risks and costs that are unique to our industry.\nInherent in our electric and natural gas operations are a variety of hazards and operating risks, such as fires, electric contacts, leaks, explosions, catastrophic failures and mechanical problems. These risks could cause a loss of human life, significant damage to property, loss of customer load, environmental pollution, impairment of our operations, and substantial financial losses to us and others. Fires alleged to have been caused by our system could also expose us to significant damage claims on theories such as strict liability, negligence, gross negligence, trespass, inverse condemnation, and others. The risk of wildfires is exacerbated in forested areas where beetle infestations have caused a significant increase in the quantity of standing dead and dying timber, increasing the risk that such trees may fall from either inside or outside our right-of-way into a powerline igniting a fire. For our natural gas lines located near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers, industrial sites and other public gathering areas, the level of damages resulting from these risks potentially is greater. In accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses. The occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nOur owned and jointly owned electric generating facilities are subject to risks that could result in unscheduled plant outages, unanticipated operation and maintenance expenses, increased power purchase costs and the inability to recover our investment.\nOperation of electric generating facilities involves risks, which can adversely affect energy output and efficiency levels. Operational risks include facility shutdowns due to breakdown or failure of equipment or processes, labor disputes, operator error, catastrophic events such as fires, explosions, floods, and intentional acts of destruction or other similar occurrences affecting the electric generating facilities; and operational changes necessitated by environmental legislation, litigation or regulation. The loss of a major electric generating facility would require us to find other sources of supply or ancillary services, if available, and expose us to higher purchased power costs. In early July 2013, following the return to service from a scheduled maintenance outage, Colstrip Unit 4 tripped off-line and incurred damage to its stator and rotor. Colstrip Unit 4 returned to service in early 2014. As discussed above, we were not able to fully recover our costs for the purchase of replacement power while Colstrip Unit 4 was out of service.\nOur investment in generating facilities is a long-lived asset. An early retirement of a unit before the end of the current estimated useful life or change in classification as held for use could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. The timing of a change in estimated useful life may be dependent upon events out of our control. The costs associated with a retirement, which may include, among other things, accelerated depreciation and amortization or impairment charges, accelerated asset retirement costs, severance costs and environmental remediation costs, could be material and we have no assurance of recovery of these costs from customers.\nAs part of the settlement of litigation brought by the Sierra Club and the Montana Environmental Information Center against the owners and operator of Colstrip, the owners of Units 1 and 2 agreed to shut down these units no later than July 2022. We do not have ownership in Units 1 and 2, and decisions regarding these units, including their shut down, were made by\ntheir respective owners. However, the six owners of Colstrip currently share the operating costs pursuant to the terms of an operating agreement among the owners of Units 3 and 4 and a common facilities agreement among the owners of all four units. When Units 1 and 2 discontinue operation, we anticipate incurring incremental operating costs with respect to our interest in Unit 4 and expect to experience a negative impact on our transmission revenue due to less energy available to transmit across our transmission lines. This reduction would be incorporated in our next general electric rate filing after the closure of Units 1 and 2, resulting in lower revenue credits to certain customers. In addition, the remaining life on our investment in Colstrip Unit 4 is through 2042. Recovery of costs associated with the shut-down of the facility prior to the end of the useful life would be subject to MPSC approval.\nColstrip Units 3 and 4 are supplied with fuel from adjacent coal reserves under coal supply and transportation agreements in effect through 2019. These contracts are necessary for the long-term operation of the facility. Negotiation of a new coal supply contract anticipates environmental reviews and permitting, and we cannot predict when or if those permits will be granted. If a new coal supply contract is not in place, we could continue under the current arrangement for several years if the mining company agrees, however the extraction costs would increase.\nWe also rely on a limited number of suppliers of coal for our electric generation, making us vulnerable to increased prices for fuel as existing contracts expire or in the event of unanticipated interruptions in fuel supply. We are a captive rail shipper of the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway for shipments of coal to the Big Stone Plant (our largest source of generation in South Dakota), making us vulnerable to railroad capacity and operational issues and/or increased prices for coal transportation from a sole supplier.\nWe must meet certain credit quality standards. If we are unable to maintain investment grade credit ratings, our liquidity, access to capital and operations could be materially adversely affected.\nA downgrade of our credit ratings to less than investment grade could adversely affect our liquidity. Certain of our credit agreements and other credit arrangements with counterparties require us to provide collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash to support our obligations if we fall below investment grade. Also, a downgrade below investment grade could hinder our ability to raise capital on favorable terms, including through the commercial paper markets. Higher interest rates on short-term borrowings with variable interest rates or on incremental commercial paper issuances could also have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur plans for future expansion through the acquisition of assets including natural gas reserves, capital improvements to current assets, generation investments, and transmission grid expansion involve substantial risks.\nAcquisitions include a number of risks, including but not limited to, regulatory approval, additional costs, the assumption of material liabilities, the diversion of management\u2019s attention from daily operations to the integration of the acquisition, difficulties in assimilation and retention of employees, and securing adequate capital to support the transaction. The regulatory process in which rates are determined may not result in rates that produce full recovery of our investments, or a reasonable rate of return. Uncertainties also exist in assessing the value, risks, profitability, and liabilities associated with certain businesses or assets and there is a possibility that anticipated operating and financial synergies expected to result from an acquisition do not develop. The failure to successfully integrate future acquisitions that we may choose to undertake could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business strategy also includes significant investment in capital improvements and additions to modernize existing infrastructure, generation investments and transmission capacity expansion. The completion of generation and natural gas investments and transmission projects are subject to many construction and development risks, including, but not limited to, risks related to permitting, financing, regulatory recovery, escalating costs of materials and labor, meeting construction budgets and schedules, and environmental compliance. In addition, these capital projects may require a significant amount of capital expenditures. We cannot provide certainty that adequate external financing will be available to support such projects. Additionally, borrowings incurred to finance construction may adversely impact our leverage, which could increase our cost of capital.\nPoor investment performance of plan assets of our defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit plans, in addition to other factors impacting these costs, could unfavorably impact our results of operations and liquidity.\nOur costs for providing defined benefit retirement and postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors. Assumptions related to future costs, return on investments and interest rates have a significant impact on our funding requirements related to these plans. These estimates and assumptions may change based on economic conditions, actual stock\nmarket performance and changes in governmental regulations. Without sustained growth in the plan assets over time and depending upon interest rate changes as well as other factors noted above, the costs of such plans reflected in our results of operations and financial position and cash funding obligations may change significantly from projections.\nOur obligation to include a minimum annual quantity of power in our Montana electric supply portfolio at an agreed upon price per MWH could expose us to material commodity price risk if certain QFs under contract with us do not perform during a time of high commodity prices, as we are required to make up the difference. In addition, we are subject to price escalation risk with one of our largest QF contracts.\nAs part of a stipulation in 2002 with the MPSC and other parties, we agreed to include a minimum annual quantity of power in our Montana electric supply portfolio at an agreed upon price per MWH through June 2029. The annual minimum energy requirement is achievable under normal QF operations, including normal periods of planned and forced outages. However, to the extent the supplied QF power for any year does not reach the minimum quantity set forth in the settlement, we are obligated to purchase the difference from other sources. The anticipated source for any QF shortfall is the wholesale market, which would subject us to commodity price risk if the cost of replacement power is higher than contracted QF rates.\nIn addition, we are subject to price escalation risk with one of our largest QF contracts due to variable contract terms. In estimating our QF liability, we have estimated an annual escalation rate of three percent over the remaining term of the contract (through June 2024). To the extent the annual escalation rate exceeds three percent, our results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 90458, "SIC": 4931, "TIC": "NWE"}
