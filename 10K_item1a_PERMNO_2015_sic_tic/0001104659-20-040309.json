{"cik": "946563", "company": "RETRACTABLE TECHNOLOGIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nWe could be subject to complex and costly regulation. Our business could suffer if we or our suppliers encounter manufacturing problems. We could be subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the U.S. Current or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nYou should carefully consider the following material risks facing us. If any of these risks occur, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially affected.\nWe Compete in a Marketplace Dominated by BD\nWe operate in a marketplace that is dominated by BD, the major syringe manufacturer in the U.S.\nAlthough we have made limited progress in some areas, such as the alternate care and some international markets, our volumes are not as high as they should be given the nature and quality of our products and the federal and state legislation requiring the use of safe needle devices.\nWe Have Generally Been Unable to Gain Sufficient Market Access to Achieve Profitable Operations\nWe have a history of incurring net operating losses. We may experience operating losses in the future. If we are unable to gain sufficient market access and market share, we may be unable to continue to finance research and development as well as support operations and expansion of production.\nWe Are Challenged by Uncertainties in Obtaining and Enforcing Intellectual Property Rights\nOur main competitive strength is our technology. We are dependent on patent rights, and if the patent rights are invalidated or circumvented, our business would be adversely affected. Patent protection is considered, in the aggregate, to be of material importance in the design, development, and marketing of products.\nVanishPoint\u00ae syringes comprised 85.6% of sales in 2019. Recent and expected modifications to our VanishPoint\u00ae syringes will effectively cause the modified VanishPoint\u00ae syringes products to have extended patent expiration dates, notwithstanding the recent expiration of some patents underlying the old design. Following the\nexpiration of patents related to the old design, competitors may attempt to copy aspects of such prior design, but not the current design.\nWhen the patents for the former design of the VanishPoint\u00ae syringes and other products expire, we may experience a significant and rapid loss of sales, and our competitive position in the marketplace may weaken if other competitors use our technology. Such occurrences could have a material adverse effect on profitability.\nWe do not maintain patent or trademark protection in all foreign countries, but, where possible, have taken steps to protect our patents and trademarks in those countries where we market our products or where we believe other manufacturers are most likely to attempt to replicate our technology. Our lack of patent and trademark protection in certain foreign countries heightens the risk that our designs may be copied by a competitor in those countries.\nWe Are Vulnerable to New Technologies\nBecause we have a narrow focus on particular product lines and technology (currently, predominantly retractable needle products), we are vulnerable to the development of superior competing products and to changes in technology which could eliminate or reduce the need for our products. If a superior technology is created, the demand for our products could greatly diminish.\nOur Competitors Have Greater Resources\nOur competitors have greater financial resources, larger and more established sales and marketing and distribution organizations, and greater market influence, including long-term contracts. These competitors may be able to use these resources to improve their products through research and acquisitions or develop new products, which may compete more effectively with our products. If our competitors choose to use their resources to create products superior to ours, we may be unable to sell our products and our ability to continue operations would be weakened.\nOperations May Be Affected by Foreign Trade Policy\nWe are subject to risks associated with foreign trade policy. In 2019, we used Chinese manufacturers to produce 82.6% of our products. Trade protection measures, including tariffs, and/or changes to import or export requirements could materially adversely impact our operations. As of the date of this filing, syringes are not included among the Chinese products on which the U.S. has proposed tariffs. We cannot predict the impact of potential changes to U.S. foreign trade policy. Additionally, we derive 23.4% of our revenues from international sales. International sales, particularly in emerging market countries, are further subject to a variety of regulatory, economic, and political risks as well.\nOur New Products May Not Replace Lost VanishPoint\u00ae Sales After 2020\nPatents relating to the former design of the VanishPoint\u00ae syringes expired in 2020. Following the patent expirations, we may experience declines in sales of VanishPoint\u00ae syringes due to third party use of aspects of our former design. Our future success depends on the sale of the modified VanishPoint\u00ae syringes and other new products. We have engaged in research and development for many years to develop other commercially successful products. Often, new products take a number of years to develop and sales of a new product may be disappointing.\nForeign Manufacturer May Increase Certain Risks\nMost international sales, as well as a substantial portion of domestic sales, are filled by production from Chinese manufacturers. In the event that we become unable to purchase such product from our Chinese manufacturers, we would need to find an alternate manufacturer for the blood collection set, IV catheter, Patient Safe\u00ae syringe, 0.5mL insulin syringe, 0.5mL autodisable syringe, and 2mL, 5mL, and 10mL syringes and we would increase domestic production for the 1mL and 3mL syringes. Even with increased domestic production, we may not be able to avoid a disruption in supply. In 2019, the 1mL and 3mL syringes made up 78.6% of our unit sales and\n76.5% of our revenues. We have a strong relationship with our Chinese manufacturers and we communicate with them frequently.\nOther risks of manufacturing outside the United States and foreign sales are also present, including risks associated with global economic, regulatory, or political changes, or health crises. As of March 23, 2020, we believe we have sufficient inventory to fulfill demand despite having experienced a temporary disruption in our supply of products from China due to the recent coronavirus (COVID-19) precautions in that country. Our suppliers in China have resumed production and shipments of products from China have been received.\nFluctuations in Supplies of Inventory Could Temporarily Increase Costs\nFluctuations in the cost and availability of raw materials and inventory and the ability to maintain favorable third-party manufacturing arrangements and relationships could result in the need to manufacture all of our products in the U.S. or find other manufacturers. This could temporarily increase unit costs as we ramp up domestic production.\nWe Are Controlled by One Shareholder\nThomas J. Shaw, our President and Chief Executive Officer, has investment or voting power over a total of 57.6% of the outstanding Common Stock as of March 13, 2020. Mr. Shaw therefore has the ability to direct our operations and financial affairs and to elect members of our Board of Directors. His interests may not always coincide with the Company\u2019s interests or the interests of other stockholders. This concentration of ownership, for example, may have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a change in control, impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover, or other business combination involving us, or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us, which in turn could materially adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock. Mr. Shaw\u2019s rights under the Technology License Agreement, as the owner of the technology we produce, present similar conflicts of interest.\nWe Face Inherent Product Liability Risks\nAs a manufacturer and provider of safety needle products, we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims. Additionally, our success depends on the quality, reliability, and safety of our products and defects in our products could damage our reputation. If a product liability claim is made and damages are in excess of our product liability coverage, our competitive position could be weakened by the amount of money we could be required to pay to compensate those injured by our products. In the event of a recall, we have recall insurance.\nOur Business May Be Affected by Changes in the Health Care Regulatory Environment\nIn the U.S. and internationally, government authorities may enact changes in regulatory requirements, reform existing reimbursement programs, and/or make changes to patient access to health care, all of which could adversely affect the demand for our products and/or put downward pressure on our prices. Future healthcare rulemaking could affect our business. We cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking or changes in the law.\nWe May Experience Losses in Our Investment Account\nOur investment portfolio is subject to market risk. As a result, the value and liquidity of our cash equivalents and marketable securities could fluctuate substantially. Likewise, our other income and expenses could vary materially depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of investments and other factors. Increased volatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty could increase the risk that actual amounts realized on our investments may differ from the fair values currently assigned to them. Because 22% of our liquid assets are invested in the market, fluctuations in market values could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nEpidemic Diseases or The Perception of Their Effects Could Have an Adverse Effect on Our Business\nOutbreaks of epidemic, pandemic, or contagious diseases, such as the recent coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, could divert medical resources and priorities toward the treatment of such disease rather than medical conditions for which our products are typically utilized. An outbreak of contagious disease could also negatively affect hospital admission rates or disrupt our workforce. Pandemics could result in temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our suppliers and their suppliers. Any such disruption could impact our sales and operating results. Widespread health crises also negatively affect economies which could affect demand for our products. As of March 23, 2020, we believe we have sufficient inventory to fulfill demand despite having experienced a temporary disruption in our supply of products from China due to the recent coronavirus (COVID-19) precautions in that country. Our suppliers in China have resumed production and shipments of products from China have been received.\nDisruption of Critical Information Systems or Material Breaches in The Security of Our Systems Could Harm Our Business, Customer Relations, And Financial Condition\nInformation technology helps us operate efficiently, interface with customers and suppliers, maintain financial accuracy and efficiency, and accurately produce our financial statements. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions, or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach. If our data management systems do not effectively collect, store, process, and report relevant data for the operation of our business, whether due to equipment malfunction or constraints, software deficiencies, or human error, our ability to effectively plan, forecast, and execute our business plan and comply with applicable laws and regulations will be impaired, perhaps materially. Any such impairment could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the timeliness with which we report our internal and external operating results. Third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems. In addition, unauthorized persons may attempt to hack into our systems to obtain our confidential or proprietary information or confidential information we hold on behalf of third parties. If the unauthorized persons successfully hack into or interfere with our system, we may experience a negative impact to our business and reputation. We have programs in place to detect, contain, and respond to data security incidents, and we make ongoing improvements to our systems in order to minimize vulnerabilities, in accordance with industry and regulatory standards. However, we may not be able to anticipate and prevent these intrusions or mitigate them when and if they occur. We also rely on external vendors to supply and/or support certain aspects of our information technology systems. The systems of these external vendors may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security of our own systems, and we are dependent on these third parties to deploy appropriate security programs to protect their systems. It is possible for such vulnerabilities to remain undetected for an extended period, including several years or longer. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate network security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, ransomware and other malicious software programs, and security vulnerabilities could be significant. Our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in unexpected interruptions, delays, cessation of service, and harm to our business operations. Depending on the type of breach, we could also be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and potential liability, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIllegal Distribution and Sale by Third Parties of Counterfeit Versions of Our Products Could Have A Negative Impact\nThird parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products which do not meet our rigorous manufacturing and testing standards. Our reputation and business could suffer harm as a result. In addition, diversion of products into other channels may result in reduced revenues.", "PERMNO": 88994, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "RVP"}
