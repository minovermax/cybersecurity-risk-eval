{"cik": "820081", "company": "CAMBREX CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-09", "item_1A": "Item 1A\nRisk Factors.\nFactors That May Affect Future Results\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered, including the cautionary note under the heading \u201cForward-Looking Statements.\u201d If any of the following risks manifests, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and reputation could be materially adversely affected. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the Company faces. Additionally, risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that it currently deems immaterial may also impair its business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows in the future.\nCertain of the Company\u2019s customers and suppliers comprise a significant percentage of the Company\u2019s business and the loss of one or more of these customers or suppliers could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nSales to a relatively small number of customers have historically accounted for a significant percentage of the Company\u2019s business. For example, one customer accounted for 34.5% of 2015 consolidated sales. Should this, or any other significant customer renegotiate on terms more favorable to them, or discontinue or decrease their usage of the Company\u2019s products, the loss could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flow. The Company\u2019s customers routinely attempt to reduce costs, including the costs of the Company\u2019s products, as a result of macro-economic trends and various market dynamics specifically affecting the pharmaceuticals industry.\nNew technologies, competition or a reduction in demand for the Company\u2019s products could reduce sales.\nThe markets for the Company\u2019s products are competitive and price sensitive. The Company has numerous primary API and advanced intermediate competitors throughout Western Europe and the United States and many more competitors within various segments of the markets the Company serves, including a growing number of competitors in Asia, Eastern Europe and other low-cost areas. The Company\u2019s competitors may lower prices on products in the future and the Company may, in certain cases, respond by lowering its prices. Conversely, failure to anticipate and respond to price competition may adversely impact the Company\u2019s market share. In general, innovator pharmaceutical companies expect price declines over time and especially upon contract renewals. These price declines could have a significant negative impact on future profits. Competitors may develop new technologies or products, negatively impacting the Company. Several of the Company\u2019s customers, especially those that buy its generic APIs and larger pharmaceutical companies that primarily sell patented products, have internal capabilities similar to the Company\u2019s. If one or more of these customers replace the Company\u2019s products with their own internal capabilities, demand for the Company\u2019s products may decrease. In addition, demand for the Company\u2019s products may weaken due to a reduction in R&D budgets, loss of distributors or other factors. A reduction in demand for the Company\u2019s products, particularly the one product that represented 32.1% of sales in 2015, could impair profit margins and may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flow.\nThe Company\u2019s failure to obtain new customer contracts or renew existing contracts may adversely affect its business.\nThe Company must continually renew existing customer contracts and win new contracts, which subjects the Company to potentially significant pricing pressures. In the event the Company is unable to replace these contracts timely or at all, or is forced to accept terms, including pricing terms, less favorable to the Company, the Company\u2019s revenue may not be able to be sustained or may decline. In addition, certain of the Company\u2019s long-term contracts may be cancelled or delayed by customers for any reason upon notice. Multiple cancellations, non-renewals, or renewals on less favorable terms to the Company of significant contracts could materially impact the Company\u2019s business. While the Company\u2019s preferred practice is to renegotiate new or extended agreements prior to expiration, if these contracts cannot be renewed or extended on terms acceptable to the Company or at all, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nFailure to obtain raw materials from third-party manufacturers could affect the Company\u2019s ability to manufacture and deliver its products.\nThe Company relies on third-party manufacturers to supply many of its raw materials and intermediates. In addition, the Company has a single source for supplies of some raw materials to its products. Manufacturing problems may occur with these and other outside sources. Prolonged disruptions in the supply of any of the Company\u2019s key raw materials, difficulty implementing replacement materials or new sources of supply, or a significant increase in the prices of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operating results, financial condition or cash flows. If a supplier provides the Company raw materials or other supplies that are deficient or defective or if a supplier fails to provide the Company such materials or supplies in a timely manner, the Company may have limited ability to find appropriate substitutes or otherwise meet required specifications and deadlines. Moreover, the Company could experience inventory shortages if it is required to use an alternative supplier on short notice, which also could lead to raw materials being purchased on less favorable terms than the Company has with its regular suppliers. If such problems occur, the Company may not be able to manufacture its products profitably or on time, which could harm the Company\u2019s reputation and have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nFailure to obtain sufficient quota from the Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\") could affect the Company\u2019s ability to manufacture and deliver certain products.\nThe starting materials used in several of the Company's products and many of the Company's finished products are controlled substances and are regulated by the DEA. Consequently, their manufacture, shipment (including import and export), storage, sale and use are subject to a high degree of regulation. In particular, the DEA limits the manufacturing and distribution of certain starting materials and APIs manufactured by the Company and it must regularly apply for quota to obtain and manufacture these substances. As a result of these limitations, the Company may not be able to meet commercial demand for these substances, which could harm its relationship with customers and its reputation. If the Company\u2019s DEA registration were revoked or suspended, or if any of the Company\u2019s quota applications were rejected, the Company could no longer lawfully possess, manufacture or distribute controlled substances, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nDisruptions to the Company\u2019s or its customers\u2019 manufacturing operations or supply chain could adversely affect its results.\nDue to heavy reliance on manufacturing and related operations to produce and distribute the products the Company sells, the Company could be adversely affected by disruptions to these operations or its customers\u2019 operations. The Company and its suppliers and customers operate in a highly regulated industry. Any violation of applicable regulations, failure to meet applicable manufacturing standards, or other actions by regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, plant shutdowns or the removal of products from the market that eliminates or reduces the Company\u2019s and its customer\u2019s sales of products could negatively impact the Company\u2019s business and reputation. In addition, a number of factors could cause production interruptions at the Company\u2019s facilities, including equipment malfunctions, disruptions in the supply chain, facility contamination, labor problems, raw material shortages, natural disasters, disruption in utility services, fire, terrorist activities, human error or disruptions in the operations of the Company\u2019s suppliers. Any significant disruption to those operations for these or any other reasons could adversely affect the Company\u2019s sales and customer relationships. Any sustained reduction in the Company\u2019s ability to provide products would negatively impact its sales growth expectations, cash flows and profitability.\nLitigation may harm the Company or otherwise negatively impact its management and financial resources.\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees, customers, consumers, suppliers, stockholders or others through private actions, class actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. Complex or extended litigation could cause the Company to incur large expenditures and distract its management. The cost to defend current and future litigation may be significant. There may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could decrease customer acceptance of the Company\u2019s products, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether the Company is ultimately found liable. Disputes from time to time with such companies or individuals are not uncommon, and the Company cannot be assured that it will always be able to resolve such disputes on terms favorable to the Company. As a result, litigation may adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, certain contracts with our suppliers and customers contain provisions whereby the Company indemnifies, subject to certain limitations, the counterparty for damages suffered as a result of claims related to use of the Company\u2019s products or facilities and other matters. Claims made under these provisions could be expensive to litigate and could result in significant payments.\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nRefer to Note 20 to the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the Company\u2019s environmental and legal matters.\nIncidents related to hazardous materials could adversely affect the Company.\nPortions of the Company\u2019s operations require the controlled use of hazardous materials. Although the Company designs and implements safety procedures to comply with the standards prescribed by federal, state, and local regulations, the risk of accidental contamination of property, or injury to individuals from these materials, cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of accidental contamination of property or injury to individuals caused by these materials, the Company could be liable for damages which could adversely affect its business. Additionally, any incident could shut down the Company\u2019s operations, which could have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations of the Company.\nThe Company generates waste that must be transported to approved storage, treatment and disposal facilities. The transportation and disposal of such waste are required to meet applicable state and federal statutes and regulations. The handling of such waste potentially exposes the Company to environmental liability if, in the future, it is determined that the violation of statutes or regulations occurred.\nThe Company is also a party to several environmental remediation investigations and activities and, along with other companies, has been named a potentially responsible party (\u201cPRP\u201d) for certain waste disposal sites. The Company\u2019s estimated reserve for environmental remediation is based on information currently available to it and may be subject to material adjustment in future periods as new facts or circumstances may indicate. Moreover, despite its efforts to comply with environmental laws, the Company may face significant remediation liabilities and additional legal proceedings concerning environmental matters, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nIt is the Company\u2019s policy to record appropriate liabilities for environmental matters where remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities are based on the Company\u2019s best estimate of the undiscounted future costs required to complete the remedial work. Environmental matters often span several years and frequently involve regulatory oversight or adjudication. Additionally, many remediation requirements are fluid and are likely to be affected by future technological, site and regulatory developments. Each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties, and it is possible that some of these liabilities will be materially higher than the Company has estimated.\nIn matters where the Company has been able to reasonably estimate its liability, the Company has accrued for the estimated costs associated with the study or remediation of applicable sites not owned by the Company and the Company's current and former operating sites. Reserves are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical, regulatory or legal information become available. In some jurisdictions environmental, health and safety regulations are still early in their development, and the Company cannot determine how these laws will be implemented and the impact of such regulation on the Company. Given the uncertainties regarding the status of laws, regulations, enforcement, policies, the impact of other PRPs, technology and information related to individual sites, the Company does not believe it is possible to currently develop an estimate of the range of reasonably possible environmental losses in excess of its reserves.\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nRefer to Note 20 to the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the Company\u2019s environmental and legal matters.\nPotential product liability claims, errors and omissions claims in connection with services the Company performs and potential liability under indemnification agreements between the Company and its officers and directors could adversely affect the Company.\nThe Company manufactures products intended for use by the public. These activities could expose the Company to risk of liability for personal injury or death to persons using such products. The Company seeks to reduce its potential liability through measures such as contractual indemnification provisions with customers (the scope of which may vary by customer, and the performances of which are not secured) and insurance maintained by customers. The Company could be materially and adversely affected if it were required to pay damages or incur defense costs in connection with a claim that is outside the scope of the indemnification agreements, if the indemnity, although applicable, is not performed in accordance with its terms or if the Company\u2019s liability exceeds the amount of applicable insurance or indemnity. In addition, the Company could be held liable for errors and omissions in connection with the services it performs. The Company currently maintains product liability and errors and omissions insurance with respect to these risks. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company\u2019s insurance coverage will be adequate or that insurance coverage will continue to be available on terms acceptable to the Company.\nThe Company also indemnifies its officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director was serving at the Company\u2019s request in such capacity. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited. Although the Company has a director and officer insurance policy that covers a portion of any potential exposure, the Company could be materially adversely affected if it were required to pay damages or incur legal costs in connection with a claim above its insurance limits.\nAny claims beyond the Company\u2019s insurance coverage limits, or that are otherwise not covered by the Company\u2019s insurance, may result in substantial costs and a reduction in its available capital resources.\nThe Company maintains property insurance, employer\u2019s liability insurance, product liability insurance, general liability insurance, business interruption insurance, and directors and officers liability insurance, among others. Although the Company maintains what it believes to be adequate insurance coverage, potential claims may exceed the amount of insurance coverage or may be excluded under the terms of the policy, which could cause an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results from operations. Generally, the Company would be at risk for the loss of inventory that is not within customer specifications. These amounts could be significant. In addition, in the future the Company may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage or the Company may be required to pay higher premiums and accept higher deductibles in order to secure adequate insurance coverage.\nThe Company depends on key personnel and the loss of key personnel could harm the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe Company depends on its ability to attract and retain qualified scientific and technical employees as well as a number of key executives. These employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with the Company at any time. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to retain key personnel, or to attract and retain additional qualified employees. The Company does not maintain key-man or similar policies covering any of its senior management or key personnel. The Company\u2019s inability to attract and retain key personnel would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nThe Company has and continues to make significant capital investments to its facilities to meet its potential future needs and, as a result, the Company depends on the success of attracting new and retaining existing customers\u2019 business.\nThe Company has and continues to make substantial investments in all of its manufacturing facilities. As a result, the Company\u2019s fixed costs have increased. If the Company is not able to utilize the facilities to capacity, its margins could be adversely affected.\nThe Company continues to expand its large-scale manufacturing capacity to support expected growth in the business. There can be no assurance that sales volumes will be sufficient to ensure the economical operation of this expanded capacity, in which case, the Company\u2019s results of operations could be adversely affected.\nGlobal growth is subject to a number of economic risks.\nA reduction in the availability of debt or equity capital could adversely affect the ability of the Company\u2019s customers to obtain financing for product development and could result in a decrease in, or cancellation of, orders for the Company\u2019s products as well as impact the ability of the Company\u2019s customers to make payments. The Company believes that cash flows from operations, along with funds available from a revolving line of credit, will be adequate to meet the operational and debt servicing needs of the Company, but if this does not continue to be the case the Company\u2019s business may be materially adversely affected. There is a risk that the funds available to be drawn under the Company\u2019s revolving line of credit may not be available in the event of the failure of one or more participant banks. Significant movements in the rate of exchange between the U.S. dollar and certain currencies, primarily the euro and Swedish krona, may also adversely affect the Company\u2019s results.\nIf the Company acquires other businesses, it may be harmed by difficulties in integration and employee retention, unidentified liabilities of the acquired businesses, or obligations incurred in connection with financing the acquisition.\nAll acquisitions involve known and unknown risks that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s future revenues and operating results. For example:\n\u25cf\nThe Company may fail to successfully integrate its acquisitions in accordance with its business strategy.\n\u25cf\nThe initial rationale for the acquisition may not remain viable due to a variety of factors, including unforeseen regulatory changes and market dynamics after the acquisition, and this may result in a significant delay or reduction in the profitability of the acquisition.\n\u25cf\nIntegration of acquisitions may divert management\u2019s attention away from the Company\u2019s primary product offerings, resulting in the loss of key customers or personnel, and may expose the Company to unanticipated liabilities.\n\u25cf\nThe Company may not be able to retain the skilled employees and experienced management that may be necessary to operate the businesses it acquires. If the Company cannot retain such personnel, it may not be able to locate or hire new skilled employees and experienced management to replace them.\n\u25cf\nThe Company may purchase a business that has contingent liabilities that include, among others, known or unknown environmental, patent or product liability claims.\n\u25cf\nThe Company\u2019s acquisition strategy may require it to obtain additional debt or equity financing, potentially resulting in a high level of debt obligations or significant dilution of ownership, or both.\n\u25cf\nThe Company may purchase businesses located in jurisdictions where it does not have operations and as a result it may not be able to anticipate local regulations and the impact such regulations have on its business.\nAny indemnities or warranties obtained in connection with such acquisitions may not fully cover the ultimate actual liabilities the Company incurs due to limitations in scope, amount or duration, financial limitations of the indemnitor or warrantor or other reasons.\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nAs a result of acquiring businesses or entering into other significant transactions, the Company may experience significant charges to earnings for merger related expenses. If the Company is not able to successfully integrate the acquired business, it may affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and the market price of its common stock. Furthermore, if the Company is unable to improve the operating margins of acquired businesses or operate them profitably, it may be unable to achieve its growth strategy.\nIn addition, if the Company makes one or more significant acquisitions in which the consideration includes equity shares or other securities or additional capital is raised through equity financings, equity interests in Cambrex may be significantly diluted and may result in a dilution of earnings per share. If the Company makes one or more significant acquisitions in which the consideration includes cash, it may be required to use a substantial portion of its available cash or incur a significant amount of debt or otherwise arrange additional funds to complete the acquisition, which may result in reduced liquidity, a decrease in its net income and a consequential reduction in its earnings per share.\nThe Company may be unable to effectuate a sale of Zenara in a timely manner or receive consideration in excess of the carrying value of the assets that are currently held for sale.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company committed to a plan to sell Zenara. Although the Company expects a sale to be completed during 2016, it cannot provide any assurance that it will be successful in selling the assets or operations for a price in excess of the carrying value of the assets, which are currently classified as \u201cheld for sale.\u201d For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recognized restructuring charges. In the event that the Company is unable to sell Zenara for a price at least equal to the remaining carrying value of the assets, then it will have to record additional charges, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial position.\nThe Company has a significant amount of debt.\nThe Company has a $250,000 revolving credit facility of which $30,000 was outstanding at December 31, 2015. This facility expires in November 2016, and the Company may be unable to refinance its revolving credit facility on favorable terms. If the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments on the credit facility, it will be in default. This current debt arrangement requires the Company to comply with specified financial ratios. The Company\u2019s ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond its control.\nEven if the Company is able to meet its debt service obligations, the amount of debt it has could adversely affect the Company by limiting its ability to obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, or other purposes. It also may place the Company at a disadvantage relative to its competitors who may have lower levels of debt, while making it more vulnerable to a downturn in its business or the economy in general. It may also require the Company to use a substantial portion of its cash to pay principal and interest on its debt.\nThe Company\u2019s liquidity, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected if the financial institutions which hold its funds fail.\nThe Company has significant funds held in bank deposits, money market funds and other accounts at certain financial institutions. A significant portion of the funds held in these accounts exceed insurable limits. In the normal course of business, the Company maintains cash balances with European Union banks ranging from the equivalent of $1,000 - $10,000. The Company routinely monitors the risks associated with these institutions and diversifies its exposure by maintaining smaller balances with multiple financial institutions. If any of the financial institutions where the Company has deposited funds were to fail, the Company may lose some or all of its deposited funds. Such a loss could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nThe Company has significant inventories on hand.\nThe Company maintains significant inventories and has an allowance for slow-moving and obsolete inventory. Any significant unanticipated changes in future product demand or market conditions, including obsolescence or the uncertainty in the global market, could also have an impact on the value of inventory and adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nInternational unrest or foreign currency fluctuations could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results.\nThe Company\u2019s international revenues, which include revenues from its non-U.S. subsidiaries and export sales from the U.S., represent the majority of its product revenues. The Company\u2019s operations extend to numerous countries outside of the U.S.\nThere are a number of significant risks arising from the Company\u2019s international operations, including:\n\u25cf\nthe possibility that nations or groups could boycott its products;\n\u25cf\ninflation, foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of shifts in the U.S. and local economies on those rates;\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic decline or political unrest in the markets in which it operates;\n\u25cf\ngeopolitical risks, terrorism, or acts of war or hostility;\n\u25cf\ncompliance with local laws and regulations including laws restricting the inflow of capital or cash and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties and expenses of compliance with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations;\n\u25cf\nlonger accounts receivable cycles in certain foreign countries;\n\u25cf\nimport and export licensing requirements;\n\u25cf\ngovernment sanctions that may reduce or eliminate the Company\u2019s ability to sell its products in certain countries;\n\u25cf\nthe protection of the Company\u2019s intellectual property and that of its customers.\nIf the Company is unable to effectively manage these risks, it may not produce the revenues, earnings, or strategic benefits that it anticipates which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nA significant portion of the Company\u2019s business is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which is its reporting currency. The Company recognizes foreign currency gains or losses arising from its operations in the period incurred. As a result, currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in which the Company does business have caused, and will continue to cause, foreign currency transaction gains and losses. The Company cannot predict the effects of exchange rate fluctuations upon its future operating results because of the number of currencies involved, the variability of currency exposures, and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates. The Company periodically engages in foreign exchange transactions to mitigate the impact of this volatility on its operations, but its strategies are short-term in nature and may not adequately protect its operating results from the full effects of exchange rate fluctuations.\nCertain jurisdictions have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in some circumstances, anti-bribery laws may conflict with some local customs and practices. As a result of the Company\u2019s policy to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws, the Company may be at a competitive disadvantage to competitors that are not subject to, or do not comply with, such laws. Furthermore, while employees and agents must comply with these laws, the Company cannot be certain that internal policies and procedures will always prevent violations of these laws, despite a commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics. Violations or mere allegations of such violations could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and reputation.\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nThe Company\u2019s operating results may unexpectedly fluctuate in future periods.\nThe Company\u2019s revenue and operating results can fluctuate on a quarterly basis. The operating results for a particular quarter may be higher or lower than expected as a result of a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the timing of contracts; the delay, cancellation or acceleration of a contract; seasonal slowdowns in different parts of the world; the timing of accounts receivable collections; pension contributions; changes in government regulations; and changes in exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. Because a high percentage of the Company\u2019s costs are relatively fixed in the short term, such as the cost of maintaining facilities and compensating employees, any one of these factors could have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s quarterly results. In some quarters, the Company\u2019s revenue and operating results may be significantly lower than or higher than the expectations of securities analysts and investors due to any of the factors described above.\nThe possibility the Company will be unable to protect its technologies could affect its ability to compete.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends to some degree upon its ability to develop proprietary products and technologies. However, the Company cannot be assured that patents will be granted on any of its patent applications. The Company also cannot be assured that the scope of any of its issued patents will be sufficiently broad to offer meaningful protection. The Company has patents issued in selected countries; therefore, third parties can make, use, and sell products covered by its patents in any country in which the Company does not have patent protection. In addition, the Company may be involved in patent litigation in the future. Issued patents or patents the Company licenses could be successfully challenged, invalidated or circumvented so that its patent rights would not create an effective competitive barrier. Although the Company intends to defend the validity of owned patents and use all appropriate methods to prevent their infringement, such efforts are expensive and time consuming, with no assurance of success. The ability to enforce patents depends on the laws of individual countries and each country\u2019s practices regarding enforcement of intellectual property rights. The Company provides its customers the right to use its products under label licenses that are for research purposes only. These licenses could be contested, and the Company cannot be assured that it would either be aware of an unauthorized use or be able to enforce the restrictions in a cost-effective manner.\nIf a third party claimed an intellectual property right to technology the Company uses, the Company may need to discontinue an important product or product line, alter its products and processes, defend its right to use such technology in court or pay license fees. Although the Company may, under these circumstances, attempt to obtain a license to such intellectual property, it may not be able to do so on favorable terms, or at all. Additionally, if the Company\u2019s products are found to infringe on a third party\u2019s intellectual property, the Company may be required to pay damages for past infringement, and lose the ability to sell certain products or receive licensing revenues.\nThe Company also relies on trade secrets, unpatented proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation that it seeks to protect, in part by confidentiality agreements with licensees, suppliers, employees and consultants. It is possible that these agreements will be breached and the Company will not have adequate remedies for any such breach. Disputes may arise concerning the ownership of intellectual property or the applicability of confidentiality agreements. Furthermore, the Company\u2019s trade secrets and proprietary technology may otherwise become known or be independently developed by its competitors or the Company may not be able to maintain the confidentiality of information relating to such products.\nInformation technology systems could fail to perform adequately or the Company may fail to adequately protect such systems against data corruption, cyber-based attacks, or network security breaches.\nThe Company utilizes information technology networks and systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information. In particular, the Company depends on information technology infrastructure to effectively manage its business data, supply chain, logistics, accounting, and other business processes and electronic communications between employees, customers and suppliers. Ineffective allocation and management of the resources necessary to build and sustain an appropriate technology infrastructure could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business. In addition, security breaches or system failures of this infrastructure can create system disruptions, shutdowns, or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Inability to prevent such breaches or failures, could disrupt the Company\u2019s operations or cause financial damage or loss because of lost or misappropriated information.\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nThe Company may experience difficulties implementing its global enterprise resource planning system.\nThe Company is engaged in a multi-year implementation of a global enterprise resource planning system (\u201cERP\u201d). The ERP is designed to accurately maintain the Company\u2019s books and records and provide information important to the operation of the business to the Company\u2019s management team. The Company\u2019s ERP will continue to require significant investment of human and financial resources. In implementing the ERP, we may experience significant delays, increased costs and other difficulties. Any significant disruption or deficiency in the design and implementation of the ERP could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to process orders, ship product, send invoices and track payments, fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate its business. Any issues with implementation could also cause the Company to fail to timely or accurately report its financial results. While the Company has invested significant resources in planning and project management, significant implementation issues may arise.\nThe Company could be subject to impairment charges in the future.\nUnder U.S. GAAP, the Company is required to evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually. If the Company determines that the fair value is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss will be recorded in the Company\u2019s statement of operations. The determination of fair value is a highly subjective exercise and can produce significantly different results based on the assumptions used and methodologies employed. If the Company\u2019s projected long-term sales growth rate, profit margins or terminal rate are considerably lower or the assumed weighted average cost of capital is considerably higher, future testing may indicate impairment and the Company would have to record a non-cash goodwill impairment loss in its statement of operations.\nAssessments by various tax authorities may be materially different than the Company has provided for and it may experience significant volatility in its annual and quarterly effective tax rate.\nAs a matter of course, the Company is regularly audited by federal, state, and foreign tax authorities. From time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. In recent years, the Company utilized significant tax attributes such as domestic federal foreign tax credits to reduce U.S. cash taxes. While the Company believes that it has adequately provided for any taxes related to these items, and taxes related to all other aspects of its business, any such assessments or future settlements may be materially different than it has provided. Refer to Note 10 to the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the Company\u2019s income taxes.\nThe Company has deferred tax assets that it may not be able to use under certain circumstances.\nIf the Company is unable to generate future taxable income of sufficient amounts and type in certain jurisdictions, or if there is a significant change in tax rates or the time period within which taxable income is recognized, the Company could be required to increase its valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in an increase in its recorded tax expense and a potential adverse impact on future results.\nLow investment performance by the Company\u2019s defined benefit pension plan assets or other events including changes in regulations or actuarial assumptions may increase the Company\u2019s pension expense, and may require the Company to fund a larger portion of its pension obligations, thus diverting funds from other potential uses.\nThe Company sponsors a defined benefit pension plan that covers certain eligible employees. The Company\u2019s pension expense and required contributions to the pension plan are directly affected by changes in interest rates, the value of plan assets, the projected rate of return on plan assets, the actual rate of return on plan assets, and the actuarial assumptions used to measure the defined benefit pension plan obligations. If plan assets perform below the assumed rate of return used to determine pension expense, future pension expense will increase. The proportion of pension assets to liabilities, which is called the funded status, determines the level of contribution to the plan that is required by law. Changes in the plan\u2019s funded status related to the value of assets or liabilities could increase the amount required to be funded. The Company cannot predict whether changing market or economic conditions, regulatory changes or other factors will further increase the Company\u2019s pension funding obligations, diverting funds from other potential uses.\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nAny significant change in government regulation of the drug development process could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nThe manufacturing of pharmaceutical products is subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities, including the FDA, the European Medicines Agency and comparable regulatory authorities in other countries. The process of obtaining regulatory approval to produce and market pharmaceutical products is rigorous, time-consuming, costly, and often unpredictable. The Company\u2019s business, as well as its customers\u2019 business depends in part on strict government regulation of the drug development process. Legislation may be introduced and enacted to modify regulations administered by the regulatory authorities governing the drug approval process. The Company may be unable to obtain requisite regulatory approvals on a timely basis for marketing and production of products. Conversely, any significant reduction in the scope of regulatory requirements or the introduction of simplified drug approval procedures could reduce barriers to entry which would increase competition and have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nFailure to comply with current Good Manufacturing Practices (\u201ccGMP\u201d) and other government regulations, as well as delays in obtaining regulatory approval by the Company or its customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nAll facilities and manufacturing techniques used for manufacturing products for clinical use or for commercial sale in the U.S. must be operated in conformity with cGMP regulations as required by the FDA and other comparable regulatory authorities in other countries, and for certain products, the DEA. The Company\u2019s facilities are subject to periodic regulatory and customer inspections to ensure compliance with cGMP and other requirements applicable to such products. A finding that the Company had materially violated these requirements could result in regulatory sanctions including, but not limited to, the regulatory agencies withholding approval of new drug applications or supplements and the denial of product entry into the U.S., or other countries, of products manufactured at non-compliant facilities, the loss of a customer contract, the disqualification of data for client submissions to regulatory authorities and a mandated closing of the Company\u2019s facilities. Any such violations would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business. The Company\u2019s customers are typically subject to the same, or similar regulations and any such violations or other actions by regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, plant shutdowns or product recalls that eliminate or reduce the Company\u2019s sale of its products or services could negatively impact the Company\u2019s business. In addition, the submission of new products to regulatory authorities for approval by the Company or its customers does not guarantee the approval to market the product will be granted. Each authority may impose its own requirements or delay or refuse to grant approval to the Company or customer even when the product has already been approved in another country. Products that have already been approved can be removed from the market by regulatory agencies for numerous reasons.\nThe overall level of late-stage clinical phase projects could decline and the outsourcing trends may decline, either of which could slow the Company\u2019s growth.\nThe success of the Company\u2019s business depends to a certain extent on the number of clinical phase contracts and the size of the contracts that it may obtain from pharmaceutical companies. A decline in the level of clinical phase projects or a slowing of the outsourcing trend could result in a diminished growth rate in the Company\u2019s sales and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 11707, "SIC": 2833, "TIC": "CBM"}
