{"cik": "1600422", "company": "Superior Drilling Products, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-31", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nAn extended decline in expenditures by the oil and gas industry has reduced, and is expected to continue to significantly impact our revenue and income and resulted in an impairment of our assets.\nOur business depends upon the condition of the oil and gas industry and, in particular, the willingness of oil and gas companies to make capital expenditures on exploration, drilling and production operations. The level of capital expenditures is generally dependent on the prevailing view of future oil and gas prices, which are influenced by numerous factors affecting the supply and demand for oil and gas, including:\n\u25cf worldwide economic activity;\n\u25cf the level of exploration and production activity;\n\u25cf interest rates and the cost of capital;\n\u25cf environmental regulation;\n\u25cf federal, state and foreign policies regarding exploration and development of oil and gas;\n\u25cf the ability of OPEC to set and maintain production levels and pricing;\n\u25cf governmental regulations regarding future oil and gas exploration and production;\n\u25cf the cost of exploring and producing oil and gas;\n\u25cf the cost of developing alternative energy sources;\n\u25cf the availability, expiration date and price of leases;\n\u25cf the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves;\n\u25cf the success of drilling for oil and gas in unconventional resource plays such as shale formations;\n\u25cf technological advances;\n\u25cf weather conditions.\nWe expect continued volatility in both crude oil and natural gas prices, as well as in the level of drilling and production related activities. Even during periods of high prices for oil and natural gas, companies exploring for oil and gas may cancel or curtail programs, seek to renegotiate contract terms, including the price of our products and services, or reduce their levels of capital expenditures for exploration and production for a variety of reasons. These risks are greater during periods of low or declining commodity prices. Continued significant or prolonged declines in hydrocarbon prices have had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nDue to reduced commodity prices and the unprecedented rapid decline in the rig count during 2015 and 2016 to historic lows, we had measurably lower operating cash flows. As a result of this situation coupled with pending payments required on our indebtedness, we may be unable to maintain adequate liquidity and make payments on our debt.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had working capital of approximately $2.1 million. During 2015 and into 2016, our principal sources of liquidity were cash flow from operations and our $3 million credit facility with Federal National Commercial Credit (\u201cFNCC\u201d). In addition, on August 5, 2016, we completed the $1 million Bridge Financing (as defined in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d) to provide us with liquidity until we could close the public offering described below. Our principal uses of cash are operating expenses, working capital requirements, capital expenditures and debt service payments. Given the current environment of the oil and gas industry, our revenue dramatically declined in 2015 and 2016.\nOn September 30, 2016, we priced a public offering of common stock at $1.00 per share. The transaction closed on October 5, 2016 and was recorded as a receivable and common stock subscribed. Net of underwriting and stock offering expenses of approximately $709,000, proceeds to the Company were approximately $5.0 million. The Company used the proceeds to pay off the $1 million Bridge Financing and its $868,000 indebtedness with FNCC, as well as for general corporate purposes, including working capital.\nAs amended and restated effective August 10, 2016, the Hard Rock Note accrues interest at 5.75% per annum and matures and is fully payable on January 15, 2020. Under the current terms of Hard Rock Note, and after the payment described below, we are required to make the following payments: accrued interest on each of January 15, March 15, May 15 and July 15, 2017, $500,000 (plus accrued interest) on each of January 15, March 15, May 15 and July 15, 2018, and $1,000,000 (plus accrued interest) on each of January 15, March 15, May 15 and July 15, 2019, with the remaining balance of principal and accrued interest on the Hard Rock Note due on January 15, 2020.\nIn connection with the amendment and restatement, we made an interest payment of approximately $304,000 on the Hard Rock Note. In addition we issued 700,000 restricted shares of common stock (having an agreed per share value of $1.43, or $1,000,000 in the aggregate) as payment for $1,000,000 of the $1,500,000 due on the Hard Rock Note on or before October 15, 2016. Interest continued to accrue on the Hard Rock Note based on the $1,000,000 value of the shares until the resale of such shares was registered with the SEC, which was completed on November 21, 2016.\nOur operational and financial strategies include lowering our operating costs and capital spending to match revenue trends, managing our working capital and managing our debt to enhance liquidity. For example, to conserve cash, we implemented a salary for stock options program during the first quarter of 2016 for senior management and our board of directors. With the recent capital raise, the success we are having with our distributor agreement with DTI and the opportunity with our new CTS tool, we believe we should have sufficient capital to support our opportunities in 2017. We may need additional capital to support additional growth. We cannot provide any assurance that financing will be available to us in the future on acceptable terms.\nWe will continue to work to grow revenue and review additional cost cutting measures with the goal to be cash flow positive in 2017. If we are unable to do this, we may not be able to, among other things, (i) maintain our current general and administrative spending levels; (ii) fund certain obligations as they become due; and (iii) respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated capital requirements.\nFailure to generate sufficient revenue to make payments on the Hard Rock Note could result in our loss of the patents securing such note.\nOn August 10, 2016, certain of our subsidiaries entered into an amended and restated note with the seller in our acquisition of Hard Rock Solutions, LLC (as so amended and restated, the \u201cHard Rock Note\u201d). As amended and restated, the Hard Rock Note accrues interest at 5.75% per annum and matures and is fully payable on January 15, 2020. Under the current terms of the Hard Rock Note, we are required to make the following payments: accrued interest only on each of January15, March 15, May 15 and July 15, 2017; $500,000 in principal plus accrued interest on each of January 15, March 15, May 15 and July 15, 2018, and $1,000,000 in principal plus accrued interest on each of January 15, March 15, May 15 and July 15, 2019. The remaining balance of principal of $2,000,000 and accrued interest on the Hard Rock Note are due on January 15, 2020.\nThe Hard Rock Note is secured by all of the patents, patents pending, other patent rights, and the Drill-N-Ream trademark purchased in the Hard Rock acquisition (the \u201cDrill-N-Ream Collateral\u201d). If we do not have the funds necessary to make the future payments under the Hard Rock Note and fail to make any payments as required thereunder, and we are unsuccessful in amending or restructuring the payment terms, the holder of the Hard Rock Note could conduct a foreclosure sale on the Drill-N-Ream Collateral in order to apply the proceeds thereof toward repayment of the Hard Rock Note and all foreclosure costs, and our subsidiary Superior Drilling Solutions, LLC would be liable for any shortfall or receive any excess from the sales proceeds. The failure to retain and use the Drill-N-Ream Collateral in our business could cause a significant loss of our investment and might have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation, as well as our ability to grow our drill string tool business.\nOur level of indebtedness could adversely affect our future ability to raise additional capital to fund growth, limit our ability to react to changes in our business or our industry and place us at a competitive disadvantage.\nAs noted above, we are required to make payments on the Hard Rock Note of accrued interest only in 2017, $2.0 million (plus accrued interest) in 2018 and $4.0 million (plus accrued interest) for 2019, with the balance due on maturity in January 2020. Interest will continue to accrue on the Hard Rock Note based on the $1,000,000 value of the shares of common stock until such shares are registered. In addition, we are required to make monthly payments of approximately $135,000 on our other indebtedness. During the year ending December 31, 2016, we paid interest of $769,582 and a principal payment of $2,000,000 on the Hard Rock Note, of which $1,000,000 was paid in stock. In addition, we issued 700,000 restricted shares of common stock on August 10, 2016 (having an agreed per share value of $1.43, or $1,000,000 in the aggregate) as payment for the remaining $1,000,000 required principal payment. The Company paid interest of $406,250 and a principal payment of $2,500,000 during the year ending December 31, 2015.\nOur level of debt and debt service requirements could have important consequences. For example, it could (i) result in a foreclosure upon our key assets, (ii) increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, (iii) limit our ability to fund future capital expenditures and working capital, to engage in future acquisitions or development activities, or to otherwise realize the value of our assets and opportunities fully because of the need to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, (iv) increase our cost of borrowing, (v) restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures, (vi) limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or industry in which we operate, placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared with our competitors who are less leveraged and (vii) impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.\nThere may be significant annual and quarterly fluctuations in our operating results.\nSignificant annual and quarterly fluctuations in our results of operations may be caused by, among other factors, our volume of revenue, the timing of new product or service announcements, releases by us and our competitors in the marketplace of new products or services, seasonality and general economic conditions. There can be no assurance that the level of revenue achieved by us in any particular fiscal period will not be significantly lower than in other comparable fiscal periods. We believe quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied on as indicators of future performance. Our operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term and are based on management\u2019s expectations of future revenue. As a result, if future revenue is below expectations, net income or loss may be disproportionately affected by a reduction in revenue, as any corresponding reduction in expenses may not be proportionate to the reduction in revenue.\nOur customer base is concentrated and the loss of, or nonperformance by, one or more of our significant customers could cause our revenue to decline substantially.\nWe had two large customers that comprised 62% of our total revenue in 2016. It is likely that we will continue to derive a portion of our revenue from a relatively small number of customers in the future. If a major customer decided not to continue to use our services or significantly reduces its drilling plans, our revenue would decline and our operating results and financial condition could be harmed. In addition, we are subject to credit risk due to the concentration of our customer base. Any increase in the nonpayment of and nonperformance by our counterparties, either as a result of changes in financial and economic conditions or otherwise, could have a material effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and could adversely affect our liquidity.\nWe must continue to develop new technologies, methodologies and products on a timely and cost-effective basis to satisfy the needs of our customers.\nThe drilling industry is driven primarily by cost minimization, and our strategy is aimed at reducing drilling costs through the application of new drill bit assembly and drill string tool technologies. Our continued success will depend on our ability to meet our customers\u2019 changing needs, on a timely and cost-effective basis, by successfully enhancing our current products and processes; developing, producing and marketing new products and processes; and responding to evolving industry standards and other technological changes.\nWe cannot assure you that our products will be able to satisfy the specifications of our customers or that we will be able to perform the testing necessary to prove that the product specifications are satisfied in the future, or that the costs of modifications to our products to satisfy their requirements will not adversely affect our results of operations. Failure to meet our customer\u2019s demand for services may adversely affect our business. We may encounter resource constraints, competition, or other difficulties that may delay our ability to expand our bit remanufacturing services to the level desired or required by our customer. If our products are unable to satisfy such requirements, or we are unable to perform any required testing, our customers may cancel their contracts and/or seek new suppliers, and our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position may be adversely affected.\nOur related party transactions with the Meiers and their affiliated entities may cause conflicts of interests that may adversely affect us.\nWe have entered into, and may, in the future, enter into various transactions and agreements with the Meiers and their affiliated entities. We believe that the transactions and agreements that we have entered into with the Meiers are on terms that are at least as favorable as could reasonably have been obtained at such time from third parties. However, these relationships could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when our board of directors is faced with decisions that could have different implications for us and the Meiers or their affiliates. The appearance of conflicts, even if such conflicts do not materialize, might adversely affect the public\u2019s perception of us, as well as our relationship with other companies and our ability to enter into new relationships in the future, which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to do business.\nOur customers\u2019 industries are undergoing continuing consolidation that may impact our results of operations.\nThe oil and gas industry is rapidly consolidating and, as a result, some of our largest customers have consolidated and are using their size and purchasing power to seek economies of scale and pricing concessions. This consolidation may result in reduced capital spending by some of our customers or the acquisition of one or more of our primary customers, which may lead to decreased demand for our products and services. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our level of sales to a customer that has consolidated or replace that revenue with increased business activity with other customers. As a result, the acquisition of one or more of our primary customers, such as Baker Hughes, may have a significant negative impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. We are unable to predict what effect consolidations in the industry may have on price, capital spending by our customers, our market share and selling strategies, our competitive position, our ability to retain customers or our ability to negotiate favorable agreements with our customers.\nWe may be unable to successfully compete with other manufacturers of drilling equipment.\nSeveral of our competitors are diversified multinational companies with substantially larger operating staffs and greater capital resources than ours and which have been engaged in the manufacturing business for a much longer time than us. If these competitors substantially increase the resources they devote to developing and marketing competitive products and services, we may not be able to compete effectively. Similarly, consolidation among our competitors could enhance their competing market share, product and service offerings and financial resources, further intensifying competition.\nWe are dependent on key personnel who may be difficult to replace.\nOur success is dependent to a significant degree upon the business expertise and continued contributions of our founders and senior management team. In particular, we are dependent upon the efforts and services of our founders, Mr. Troy Meier, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Ms. Annette Meier, our President, because of their knowledge, experience, skills, and relationships with major clients and the other members of our management team. Our future success also depends on our ability to identify, attract, hire, train, retain and motivate other highly skilled technical, managerial, marketing and customer service personnel. Competition for such personnel in is intense, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully attract, integrate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel. Our inability to retain these types of individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIncreases in the cost of raw materials used in our manufacturing processes could negatively impact our profitability.\nWe rely on the availability of volume and quality of synthetic diamond cutters for both our drill bit refurbishment and manufacturing business and for our drill string tool manufacturing business. In addition, we must have a reliable source of steel available for our manufacturing business which is both of sufficient quality, and available at a cost-effective price. We do not have fixed price contracts or arrangements for all of the raw materials and other supplies that we purchase. Baker Hughes provides the diamond cutters for our drill bit refurbishment business. However, sourcing cost-effective supplies of quality steel in the relatively low volumes that our tool manufacturing requires can be challenging. Shortages of, and price increases for, steel and other raw materials and supplies that we use in our business may occur. Future shortages or price fluctuations in synthetic diamond cutters or steel could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct either our drill bit refurbishment or our drill tool manufacturing business or our new drill tools in a timely and cost effective manner.\nWe depend on third-party suppliers for timely deliveries of raw materials, and our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies in a timely manner.\nOur manufacturing operations depend upon obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials from third parties. Events beyond our control may impact the ability of these third parties to deliver raw materials may be affected by events beyond our control. Any interruption in the supply of raw materials needed to manufacture our products could adversely affect our business, results of operations and reputation with our customers.\nWe may be exposed to unforeseen risks in our product manufacturing and processes, which could adversely affect our financial conditions and results of operations.\nWe operate our business from our Vernal, Utah manufacturing facilities. A natural disaster, extended utility failure or other significant event at our facility could significantly affect our ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of key products or otherwise deliver products to meet customer demand or contractual requirements which may result in a loss of revenue and other adverse business consequences. In addition, the equipment and management systems necessary for our operations are subject to wear and tear, break down and obsolescence, which could cause them to perform poorly or fail, resulting in fluctuations in manufacturing efficiencies and production costs. Significant manufacturing fluctuations may affect our ability to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis and we may suffer financial penalties and a diminution of our commercial reputation and future product orders. Additionally, some of our business may in the future be conducted under fixed price contracts. Fluctuations in our manufacturing process, or inaccurate estimates and assumptions used in pricing our contracts, even if due to factors out of our control, may result in cost overruns which we may be required to absorb. Any shut down of our manufacturing facility, reductions in our manufacturing process or efficiency, or cost overruns could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operating history may not be sufficient for investors to evaluate our business and prospects.\nWe are a recently formed company with a short operating history. This may make it more difficult for investors to evaluate our business and prospects and to forecast our future operating results. As a result, historical financial data may not give you an accurate indication of what our actual results would have been if subsequent acquisitions had been completed at the beginning of the periods presented or of what our future results of operations are likely to be. Our future results will depend on our ability to efficiently manage our operations and execute our business strategy.\nWe may be unable to employ enough skilled and qualified workers to sustain or expand our current operations.\nOur operations require personnel with specialized skills and experience. The supply of skilled and experienced personnel may not be sufficient to meet current or expected demand. Any significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction of our skilled labor force, increases in the wage rates that we must pay, or both. If any of these events were to occur, our capacity could be diminished, our ability to respond quickly to customer demands or strong market conditions may be inhibited and our growth potential impaired, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are not able to manage our growth strategy successfully, our business, and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur growth strategy includes acquisitions and the development and implementation of new product designs and improvements, which presents numerous managerial, administrative, operational, and other challenges. Our ability to manage the growth of our operations will depend on our ability to develop systems and services and related technologies to meet evolving industry requirements and at prices acceptable to our customers to compete in the industry in which we operate. Our ability to compete effectively will also depend on our ability to continue to obtain patents on our proprietary technology and products. Although we do not consider any single patent to be material to our business, the inability to protect our future innovations through patents could have a material adverse effect. In addition, our growth will increase our need to attract, develop, motivate, and retain both our management and professional employees. The inability of our management to manage our growth effectively or the inability of our employees to achieve anticipated performance could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAcquisitions and investments may not result in anticipated benefits and may present risks not originally contemplated, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur growth strategy includes acquiring other companies that complement our service offerings or broaden our technical capabilities and geographic presence. From time to time, we evaluate purchases and sales of assets, businesses or other investments. These transactions may not result in the anticipated realization of savings, creation of efficiencies, offering of new products or services, generation of cash or income or reduction of risk. In addition, acquisitions may be financed by borrowings, requiring us to incur debt, or by the issuance of our common stock. These transactions involve numerous risks, and we cannot ensure that:\n\u25cf any acquisition would be successfully integrated into our operations and internal controls;\n\u25cf the due diligence conducted prior to an acquisition would uncover situations that could result in financial or legal exposure;\n\u25cf the use of cash for acquisitions would not adversely affect our cash available for capital expenditures and other uses;\n\u25cf any disposition, investment, acquisition or integration would not divert management resources from the operation of our business; or\n\u25cf any disposition, investment, acquisition or integration would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur inability to integrate acquisitions successfully could impede us from realizing all of the benefits of the acquisitions which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to successfully integrate future acquisitions, we could be impeded from realizing all of the anticipated benefits of those acquisitions and could weaken our business operations. The integration process may disrupt our business and, if implemented ineffectively, may preclude realization of the anticipated benefits expected by us and could harm our results of operations. In addition, the overall integration of the combining companies may result in unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities and competitive responses, and may cause our stock price to decline. The difficulties of integrating an acquisition include, among others:\n\u25cf unanticipated issues in integration of information, communications, and other systems;\n\u25cf unanticipated incompatibility of logistics, marketing, and administration methods;\n\u25cf maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees;\n\u25cf integrating the business cultures of both companies;\n\u25cf preserving important strategic client relationships;\n\u25cf coordinating geographically separate organizations; and\n\u25cf consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations.\nEven if the operations of an acquisition are integrated successfully, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, including the synergies, cost savings or growth opportunities that we expect. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. Failing to realize the benefits could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nConditions in the global financial system may have impacts on our business and financial position that we currently cannot predict.\nUncertainty in the credit markets may negatively impact the ability of our customers to finance purchases of our products and services and could result in a decrease in, or cancellation of, orders or adversely affect the collectability of our receivables. If the availability of credit to our customers is reduced, they may reduce their drilling and production expenditures, thereby decreasing demand for our products and services, which could have a negative impact on our financial position. Additionally, unsettled conditions could have an impact on our suppliers, causing them to be unable to meet their obligations to us. Although we do not currently anticipate a need to access the credit markets in the short term, a prolonged constriction on future lending by banks or investors could result in higher interest rates on future debt obligations or could restrict our ability to obtain sufficient financing to meet our long-term operational and capital needs.\nA terrorist attack or armed conflict could harm our business.\nTerrorist activities, anti-terrorist efforts and other armed conflicts involving the United States or other countries may adversely affect the United States and global economies and could prevent us from meeting our financial and other obligations. If any of these events occur, the resulting political instability and societal disruption could reduce overall demand for oil and natural gas, potentially putting downward pressure on demand for our services and causing a reduction in our revenue. Oil and natural gas related facilities could be direct targets of terrorist attacks, and our operations could be adversely impacted if infrastructure integral to our customers\u2019 operations is destroyed or damaged. Costs for insurance and other security may increase as a result of these threats, and some insurance coverage may become more difficult to obtain, if available at all.\nMaterials and minerals used in our manufacturing process may become subject to laws and regulations that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities.\nThe diamonds comprising the diamond cutting discs used in our operations are synthetic and manufactured in the United States, South Africa and China. Neither those diamond cutters nor any other minerals used in our operations are currently identified as \u201cconflict minerals\u201d in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. However, we cannot predict or control if the United States Secretary of State will or will not identify one of the minerals used in our manufacturing process as a conflict mineral. Should the materials used in our manufacturing process be designated as a conflict mineral, we will be required to file Form SD with the SEC and conduct the required diligence to determine the source of the conflict mineral in connection with such disclosure. Any increased costs and expenses associated with this could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe use and protection of our proprietary technology will affect our success. There are limitations to our intellectual property rights in our proprietary technology, and thus our right to exclude others from the use of such proprietary technology.\nOur success will be affected by our development and implementation of new product designs and improvements and by our ability to protect and maintain critical intellectual property assets related to these developments. Although in many cases our products are not protected by any registered intellectual property rights, in other cases we rely on a combination of patents and trade secret laws to establish and protect this proprietary technology.\nWe currently hold multiple U.S. patents and have multiple pending patent applications for products and processes in the U.S. and certain non-U.S. countries. Patent rights give the owner of a patent the right to exclude third parties from making, using, selling, and offering for sale the inventions claimed in the patents in the applicable country. Patent rights do not necessarily grant the owner of a patent the right to practice the invention claimed in a patent, but merely the right to exclude others from practicing the invention claimed in the patent. It may also be possible for a third party to design around our patents. Furthermore, patent rights have strict territorial limits. Some of our work will be conducted in international waters and therefore may not fall within the scope of any country\u2019s patent jurisdiction. We may not be able to enforce our patents against infringement occurring in international waters and other \u201cnon-covered\u201d territories. Also, we do not have patents in every jurisdiction in which we conduct business and our patent portfolio will not protect all aspects of our business and may relate to obsolete or unusual methods, which would not prevent third parties from entering the same market.\nWe attempt to limit access to and distribution of our technology by customarily entering into confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers and potential customers and suppliers. Our rights in our confidential information, trade secrets, and confidential know-how will not prevent third parties from independently developing similar information. Publicly available information (e.g. information in expired issued patents, published patent applications, and scientific literature) can also be used by third parties to independently develop technology. We cannot provide assurance that this independently developed technology will not be equivalent or superior to our proprietary technology.\nOur competitors may infringe upon, misappropriate, violate or challenge the validity or enforceability of our intellectual property and we may not able to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights in the future.\nOur businesses and our customers\u2019 businesses are subject to environmental laws and regulations that may increase our costs, limit the demand for our products and services or restrict our operations.\nOur operations and the operations of our customers are also subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and the environment. These environmental laws and regulations affect the products and services we design, market and sell, as well as the facilities where we manufacture our products. For example, our operations are subject to numerous and complex laws and regulations that, among other things, may regulate the management and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes; require acquisition of environmental permits related to our operations; restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various materials that can be released into the environment; limit or prohibit operation activities in certain ecologically sensitive and other protected areas; regulate specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection; require compliance with operational and equipment standards; impose testing, reporting and record-keeping requirements; and require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations. We are required to invest financial and managerial resources to comply with such environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and anticipate that we will continue to be required to do so in the future. In addition, environmental laws and regulations could limit our customers\u2019 exploration and production activities. These laws and regulations change frequently, which makes it impossible for us to predict their cost or impact on our future operations. For example, legislation to regulate emissions of greenhouse gases has been introduced in the U.S. Congress, and there has been a wide-ranging policy debate, both nationally and internationally, regarding the impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation. In addition, efforts have been made and continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues, such as the annual United Nations Climate Change Conferences. Also, the EPA has undertaken new efforts to collect information regarding greenhouse gas emissions and their effects. Following a finding by the EPA that certain greenhouse gases represent a danger to human health, the EPA has expanded its regulations relating to those emissions and has adopted rules imposing permitting and reporting obligations. The results of the permitting and reporting requirements could lead to further regulation of these greenhouse gases by the EPA. To date, there has been no significant legislative progress in cap and trade proposals or greenhouse gas emission reductions. The adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the hydrocarbons that our customers produce. Consequently, such legislation or regulatory programs could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. It is too early to determine whether, or in what form, further regulatory action regarding greenhouse gas emissions will be adopted or what specific impact a new regulatory action might have on us or our customers. Generally, the anticipated regulatory actions do not appear to affect us in any material respect that is different, or to any materially greater or lesser extent, than other companies that are our competitors. However, our business and prospects could be adversely affected to the extent laws are enacted or modified or other governmental action is taken that prohibits or restricts our customers\u2019 exploration and production activities or imposes environmental protection requirements that result in increased costs to us or our customers.\nEnvironmental laws may provide for \u201cstrict liability\u201d for damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety, rendering a party liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such party. Sanctions for noncompliance may include revocation of permits, corrective action orders, administrative or civil penalties, and criminal prosecution. Some environmental laws and regulations provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances. In addition, we may be subject to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as a result of alleged exposure to hazardous substances, as well as damage to natural resources. These laws and regulations also may expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others, or for our acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations at the time such acts were performed. Any of these laws and regulations could result in claims, fines or expenditures that could be material to results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nOur failure to implement and comply with our safety program could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition.\nOur safety program is a fundamental element of our overall approach to risk management, and the implementation of the safety program is a significant issue in our dealings with our clients. Unsafe job sites and office environments have the potential to increase employee turnover, increase the cost of a project to our clients, expose us to types and levels of risk that are fundamentally unacceptable, and raise our operating costs. The implementation of our safety processes and procedures are monitored by various agencies and rating bureaus, and may be evaluated by certain clients in cases in which safety requirements have been established in our contracts. If we fail to comply with safety regulations or maintain an acceptable level of safety at our facilities we may incur fines, penalties or other liabilities, or may be held criminally liable. We may incur additional costs to upgrade equipment or conduct additional training, or otherwise incur costs in connection with compliance with safety regulations. Failure to maintain safe operations or achieve certain safety performance metrics could disqualify us from doing business with certain customers, particularly major oil companies.\nOur products are used in operations that are subject to potential hazards inherent in the oil and gas industry and, as a result, we are exposed to potential liabilities that may affect our financial condition and reputation.\nOur products are used in potentially hazardous drilling, completion and production applications in the oil and gas industry where an accident or a failure of a product can potentially have catastrophic consequences. Risks inherent to these applications, such as equipment malfunctions and failures, equipment misuse and defects, explosions, blowouts and uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids and natural disasters, on land or in deep water or shallow-water environments, can cause personal injury, loss of life, suspension of operations, damage to formations, damage to facilities, business interruption and damage to or destruction of property, surface water and drinking water resources, equipment and the environment. In addition, we provide certain services that could cause, contribute to or be implicated in these events. If our products or services fail to meet specifications or are involved in accidents or failures, we could face warranty, contract or other litigation claims, which could expose us to substantial liability for personal injury, wrongful death, property damage, loss of oil and gas production, and pollution and other environmental damages. Our insurance policies may not be adequate to cover all liabilities. Further, insurance may not be generally available in the future or, if available, insurance premiums may make such insurance commercially unjustifiable. Moreover, even if we are successful in defending a claim, it could be time-consuming and costly to defend.\nIn addition, the frequency and severity of such incidents could affect operating costs, insurability and relationships with customers, employees and regulators. In particular, our customers may elect not to purchase our products or services if they view our safety record as unacceptable, which could cause us to lose customers and substantial revenue. In addition, these risks may be greater for us because we may acquire companies that have not allocated significant resources and management focus to quality, or safety requiring rehabilitative efforts during the integration process. We may incur liabilities for losses associated with these newly acquired companies before we are able to rehabilitate such companies\u2019 quality, safety and environmental programs.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. A failure to establish and maintain our internal control over financial reporting could harm our business and financial results.\nIn connection with the preparation of this Annual Report, our management concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to certain material weaknesses.\nDuring the course of the assessments, management identified that we have a lack of staffing within our accounting department, in terms of the small number of employees performing our financial and accounting functions, which does not provide the necessary segregation of duties surrounding the cash disbursements process, and a lack of accounting expertise to appropriately apply GAAP for complex and non-routine transactions, which results in a material weakness. To remediate these issues, management has retained the services of additional third party accounting personnel as well as to modify existing disclosure controls and procedures in a manner designed to ensure future compliance. Our management currently believes the additional accounting resources will remediate the weakness with respect to insufficient personnel.\nThese processes provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of their inherent limitations, these processes are not intended to provide absolute assurance that we would prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial statements or fraud. Any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely, or to detect and prevent fraud. Failure to remediate these material weaknesses or additional material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting could cause a loss of investor confidence and decline in the market price of our stock.\nOur information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security.\nWe rely on our proprietary production management technology which has changed how users connect to our knowledge and other information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems to conduct our business. Despite our security and back-up measures, our IT systems are vulnerable to computer viruses, natural disasters and other disruptions or failures. The failure of our IT systems to perform as anticipated for any reason or any significant breach of security could disrupt our business and result in numerous adverse consequences, including reduced effectiveness and efficiency of our operations and those of our customers, inappropriate disclosure of confidential information, increased overhead costs, loss of intellectual property and damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to prevent or respond to damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nAs a smaller reporting company, we are subject to scaled disclosure requirements that may make it more challenging for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects.\nCurrently, we are a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d meaning that our outstanding common stock held by non-affiliates had a market value of less than $75 million as of June 15, 2016. As a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d we are able to provide simplified executive compensation disclosures in our filings; are exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring that independent registered public accounting firms provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting; and have certain other decreased disclosure obligations in our SEC filings, including, being required to provide only two years of audited financial statements in annual reports. Consequently, it may be more challenging for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects.\nWe are an emerging growth company, and any decision on our part to comply only with certain reduced reporting and disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an emerging growth company, and, for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may choose to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to have our independent registered public accounting firm audit our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years following the completion of our initial public offering in May 2014. We will cease to be an emerging growth company upon the earliest of: (a) the end of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering, (b) the first fiscal year after our annual gross revenue exceeds $1.0 billion, (c) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities or (d) the end of any fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700 million as of the end of the second quarter of that fiscal year. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive if we choose to rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of any choices to reduce future disclosure, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and the price of our common stock may be more volatile.\nUnder the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. However, we have elected to adopt new or revised accounting standards at such times as applicable to other non-emerging grown public companies.\nFurthermore, a material weakness in internal controls may remain undetected for a longer period because of our extended exemption from the auditor attestation requirements under Section 404(b) of Sarbanes-Oxley.\nAs long as we are controlled by the Meiers, the ability of our stockholders to influence the outcome of matters will be limited.\nThe Meiers continue to own a substantial portion of our outstanding common stock and serve on our Board of Directors. As long as they have voting control of our company, SDPI will have the ability to take many stockholder actions, including the election or removal of directors, irrespective of the vote of, and without prior notice to, any other stockholder. As a result, the Meiers will have the ability to influence or control all matters affecting us, including:\n\u25cf the composition of our board of directors and, through our board of directors, decision-making with respect to our governance and business direction and policies, including the appointment and removal of our officers;\n\u25cf any determinations with respect to acquisitions of businesses, mergers or other business combinations and change of control transactions;\n\u25cf our acquisition or disposition of assets; and\n\u25cf our capital structure.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock and the price at which we may sell common stock in the future are subject to large fluctuations in response to any of the following:\n\u25cf limited trading volume in our common stock;\n\u25cf quarterly variations in operating results;\n\u25cf general financial market conditions;\n\u25cf the prices of natural gas and oil;\n\u25cf announcements by us and our competitors;\n\u25cf our liquidity;\n\u25cf changes in government regulations;\n\u25cf our ability to raise additional funds;\n\u25cf our involvement in litigation; and\n\u25cf other events.\nWe do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the near future.\nWe have not paid any dividends in the past and do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain any earnings for the future operation and development of our business. In addition, under Utah law no distribution may be made if, after giving it effect: (a) we would be unable to pay our debts as they come due, or (b) our total assets would be less than our total liabilities. We can provide no assurance that those restrictions will not prevent us from paying a dividend in future periods.\\\nWe may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock.\nOur articles of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our shareholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our common stock. For example, we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.\nCertain provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change in control.\nThe existence of some provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change in control of our company, even if that change would be beneficial to our shareholders. Our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make acquiring control of our company difficult, including:\n\u25cf provisions regulating the ability of our shareholders to nominate directors for election or to bring matters for action at annual meetings of our shareholders;\n\u25cf limitations on the ability of our shareholders to call a special meeting and act by written consent;\n\u25cf the authorization given to our board of directors to issue and set the terms of preferred stock; and\n\u25cf establishment of a classified board of directors.", "PERMNO": 14636, "SIC": 3533, "TIC": "SDPI"}
