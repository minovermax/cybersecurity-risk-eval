RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have incurred substantial losses since inception and anticipate that we will incur continued losses through at least the next year, we may not be able to raise additional financing to fund future losses.\nWe have experienced substantial net losses since our inception in late 2002 and expect such losses to continue through at least the year ending December 31, 2015 as we continue to commercialize our technologies and develop new applications and technologies. As of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $406.9 million. We have funded our operations to date principally from the sale of our securities, the issuance of debt and through partnering and the licensing of intellectual property. As of December 31, 2014, our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash total was $31.9 million. We incurred an operating loss of $54.2 million and had negative cash flows from operations of $42.4 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014. In addition, we are also subject to minimum liquidity requirements under our existing borrowing arrangement with White Oak Global Advisors, LLC that requires us to maintain $15.0 million in liquidity, consisting of at least $13.0 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments, of which $5.0 million is required to be restricted subject to lenders\u2019 control, and up to $2.0 million in certain accounts receivable. In order to meet our long-term anticipated cash requirements, we need to obtain additional financing or adopt additional cost-cutting measures. There can be no assurance, however, that such a financing will be successfully completed on terms acceptable to us or that we can implement cost cutting measures sufficient to extend our cash and liquidity. We may seek additional financing at any time by selling additional equity or debt securities, licensing core or non-core intellectual property assets, entering into future research and development funding arrangements, refinancing or restructuring existing debt arrangements, or entering into a credit facility. If we seek\nadditional funding in the future by selling additional equity or debt securities or entering into debt or credit facilities, such additional funding may result in substantial dilution to existing stockholders, may contain unfavorable terms or may not be available on any terms.\nConditions in the global financial and credit markets may limit our ability to raise additional funds. We cannot guarantee that future equity or debt financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Further, even if financing is available, the cost to us may be significantly higher than in the past. Our ability to access the capital markets and raise funds required for our operations may be severely restricted by general market conditions at a time when we would like, or need, to do so, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our current and future funding requirements and on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. This could leave us without adequate financial resources to fund our operations as presently conducted or as we plan to conduct them in the future. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to adopt additional cost-cutting measures, including additional reductions in our work force, reducing the scope of, delaying or eliminating some or all of our planned research, development and commercialization activities and/or reducing marketing, customer support or other resources devoted to our products. If we seek additional funding through partnering and licensing transactions, we could be required to license to third parties the rights to commercialize products or technologies that we would otherwise seek to commercialize ourselves or on terms that are less attractive than they might otherwise be. Any of these factors could materially harm our business and may negatively impact our ability to continue to operate as a going concern.\nBecause we may not be successful in significantly increasing sales of our products, the extent of our future losses and the timing of achieving sustained profitability are highly uncertain, and we may never achieve sustained profitable operations. If we require more time than we expect to generate significant revenue and achieve sustained profitability, we may not be able to continue our operations. Even if we achieve significant revenues, we may never become profitable on a sustained basis.\nOur efforts to commercialize our Magellan Robotic System and Sensei system may encounter obstacles and delays which could significantly harm our ability to generate revenue.\nOur ability to generate revenues depends upon the successful commercialization of our Magellan Robotic System and Sensei system. These commercialization efforts may not succeed for a number of reasons, including those set forth in this Item 1A and the following:\n\u2022\nour systems may not be accepted by physicians or hospitals;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to sell our systems and associated catheters in volumes and at prices that allow us to meet the revenue targets necessary to generate revenue necessary to achieve profitability;\n\u2022\nthe use of our systems by customers may not achieve more predictable procedure times, enable more complex cases or result in other physician or clinical benefits that we believe will drive adoption of our products;\n\u2022\nwe, or the investigators of our products, may not be able to generate sufficient information regarding outcomes with our systems to satisfy potential purchasers;\n\u2022\nthe availability and perceived advantages of alternative treatments may hinder acceptance of our systems;\n\u2022\nour assumptions regarding the economic value proposition of our systems for hospitals, including the reimbursement rates that hospitals may achieve for procedures using our systems, may not be sufficiently accurate to drive adoption in acceptable quantities;\n\u2022\nany rapid technological change may make our products obsolete;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to manufacture our systems or catheters in commercial quantities or at an acceptable cost;\n\u2022\nwe may not have adequate financial or other resources to complete the commercialization of our systems or the development of new products; and\n\u2022\nwe may not obtain regulatory clearance for the applications for which many physicians wish to use our systems.\nIf we are not successful in the commercialization of our Sensei system for uses other than for mapping in EP procedures or the development and commercialization of our Magellan Robotic System, we may never achieve sustained profitability and may be forced to cease operations.\nSuccessful commercialization of our Magellan Robotic System is subject to manufacturing, marketing, sales and customer service risks which could significantly harm our ability to generate revenue.\nWe have limited experienced in manufacturing our Magellan Robotic System, Magellan Robotic Catheters and related accessories in commercial quantities and we may encounter unexpected manufacturing problems when scaling up the production of these new products. While we have experience marketing and selling the Sensei system following its initial regulatory approvals in 2007, the marketing and sales effort for our Magellan Robotic System involves different customers, value propositions and purchasing processes, and we are only beginning to gain experience in marketing and selling our Magellan Robotic System. Our Magellan Robotic System is a novel device, and hospitals are traditionally slow to adopt new products and treatment practices. Our Magellan Robotic System is an expensive capital equipment purchase which slows the sales process. Since the Magellan Robotic System has only recently been commercially introduced, our Magellan Robotic System has limited product and brand recognition. Furthermore, we do not believe hospitals will purchase our products unless the physicians at those hospitals express a strong desire to use our products and we cannot predict whether or not they will do so in sufficient numbers. The ability to obtain market acceptance of a new product such as the Magellan Robotic System is highly variable and subject to many risks. As a result, our commercialization plans may be delayed, incomplete or unsuccessful. While we have prepared new training materials specifically for our Magellan Robotic System, these materials have not been used extensively and only a limited number of clinical cases have been performed with our Magellan Robotic System. As a result, with greater physician experience with our Magellan Robotic System, we may identify areas where further training is required. In addition, commercial introduction of new products sometimes results in the identification of latent or new product defects or quality issues that were not evident in the testing of the products. If we encounter any of these new product introduction issues with our Magellan Robotic System, our financial condition, results of operations and business could be adversely impacted.\nWe may not be able to further develop our Magellan Robotic System as planned, which could significantly harm our ability to achieve future regulatory approvals and market acceptance.\nWe intend to further develop our Magellan Robotic System, including our Magellan Robotic Catheters and related accessories. Due to the advanced electrical, mechanical, and software capabilities of this new robotic platform, we may encounter challenges in designing, engineering and manufacturing future enhancements to the platform, which may lead to compatibility obstacles with operating room and catheter laboratory layouts, equipment quality or performance issues, unmet customer expectations regarding features or functionality or other defects in future versions of the platform. Any such difficulties could result in delays in our submissions to regulatory agencies, delays in achieving or the failure to achieve additional regulatory approvals or clearances for enhancements to the system, lack of physician adoption of our system, higher than expected service claims, litigation and negative press coverage, which may damage our business.\nIf we are unable to manufacture our systems and catheters in a manner that yields sufficient gross margins, we will be unable to achieve profitable commercialization.\nWe do not have significant experience in manufacturing, assembling or testing our current products on a commercial scale. Our products contain expensive materials and are expensive to manufacture, particularly in\nlimited quantities. In addition to increasing sales to increase manufacturing overhead absorption, we need to reduce the variable manufacturing costs of our catheters in order to achieve our operational and financial goals. We face challenges in order to produce disposable catheters effectively, to appropriately phase in new products and designs, to efficiently utilize our manufacturing facility and to achieve planned manufacturing cost reductions. If we are unable to effectively manage these issues, our costs of producing our products will negatively affect our gross margins which will negatively impact our business.\nWe are a company with a limited history of operations, which makes our future operating results difficult to predict.\nWe are a medical device company with a limited operating history and first recognized revenues in the second quarter of 2007. We have been engaged in research and product development since our inception in late 2002. Our Sensei system, received FDA, clearance in May 2007 and our corresponding disposable Artisan Control Catheter and Artisan Extend Control Catheter received FDA clearance in May 2007 and August 2012, respectively, for commercialization to facilitate manipulation, positioning and control of certain mapping catheters during EP procedures. We also received a CE Mark in Europe for our Sensei system in September 2006, for our Artisan Control Catheter in May 2007, for our Magellan Robotic System in July 2011, for our Magellan Robotic Catheter in October 2011, for our Artisan Extend Control Catheter in December 2012, and for our Magellan 6Fr Robotic Catheter in November 2014. We received FDA clearance for the commercialization of our Magellan Robotic System including the catheter and accessories in June 2012 and we received FDA clearance for the marketing of our Magellan 6Fr Robotic Catheter in February 2014, and we have also received regulatory approvals for our Sensei system and/or our Magellan Robotic System in several countries outside of the U.S, including Canada. Our Canadian license for the Sensei system, which was issued in December 2011, is conditioned upon our providing yearly safety and effectiveness data for a period of three years for post-market use of the system, including marketing history, a clinical literature review, and up-to-date data on our randomized clinical study. Failure to provide these reports may result in suspension of our license.\nThe future success of our business will depend on our ability to design and obtain regulatory approval for new products, manufacture and assemble our current and future products in sufficient quantities in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements and at lower costs, increase product sales and successfully support and service our products, all of which we may be unable to do. We have a limited history of operations upon which you can evaluate our business and our operating expenses have fluctuated significantly. We have only recently introduced our Magellan Robotic System and do not have experience selling different systems for different applications. Our lack of a significant operating history also limits your ability to make a comparative evaluation of us, our products and our prospects. If we are unable to successfully operate our business, our business and financial condition will be harmed.\nWe have a debt facility with White Oak Global Advisors, LLC that requires us to meet certain restrictive covenants that may limit our operating flexibility.\nIn August 2013, we entered into an amended and restated $33.0 million loan and security agreement with White Oak Global Advisors, LLC, or White Oak, as a lender and as collateral agent for the lenders under the loan agreement. We are obligated to pay only interest on the loan until the loan\u2019s maturity date, which is December 30, 2017. At our option, we may prepay all or a portion of the outstanding principal balance, subject to paying a prepayment fee of 3.5% of the principal amount of the loan prepaid if our prepayment is made on or before the third anniversary of the funding of the loan or 1.0% of the principal amount of the loan prepaid if our prepayment is made after the fourth anniversary of the funding of the loan. We are also required to make mandatory prepayments upon certain events of loss and certain dispositions of our assets as described in the loan agreement.\nThe loan agreement contains customary events of default, including if we fail to make a payment on its due date, fail to perform specified obligations, fail to comply with certain covenants in the loan agreement,\nexperience a material adverse change, or becomes insolvent. We have granted the lenders a first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets, excluding any of our intellectual property, now owned or hereafter acquired, and all proceeds and products thereof. Two of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, AorTx, Inc. and Hansen Medical International, Inc., have guaranteed our obligations under the loan and have granted first priority security interests in their assets, excluding any of their intellectual property, to secure their guarantee obligations. Under the loan agreement, neither we nor Aortx, Inc. and Hansen Medical International, Inc. may grant a lien on any intellectual property to third parties. We have also pledged to the lenders shares of each of our direct and indirect subsidiaries as collateral for the loan. We are also subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants, and also to minimum liquidity requirements which require us to maintain $15.0 million in liquidity, consisting of at least $13.0 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments of which $5.0 million of which shall be restricted funds subject to lenders\u2019 control, and up to $2.0 million in certain accounts receivable. We are subject to limitations on our ability to: undergo certain change of control events; convey, sell, lease, transfer, assign or otherwise dispose of our assets; create, incur, assume, or be liable with respect to certain indebtedness; grant liens; pay dividends and make certain other restricted payments; make loans, acquisitions, or certain investments; create subsidiaries or enter into joint ventures; repurchase certain equity interests; make payments on any subordinated debt; make material changes to our core business or the core business of any of our subsidiaries; enter into transactions with any of our affiliates outside of the ordinary course of business; or permit our subsidiaries to do the same. We are also required to make mandatory prepayments upon certain events of loss and certain dispositions of our assets described in the amended loan agreement.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we were in compliance with all financial covenants. In the event we were to violate any covenants or if White Oak believes that we have violated any covenants, and such violations are not cured pursuant to the terms of the loan and security agreement, we would be in default under the loan and security agreement, which would entitle White Oak to exercise their remedies, including the right to accelerate the debt, upon which we may be required to repay all amounts then outstanding under the loan and security agreement. Complying with these covenants may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy.\nIf Philips is unable to develop or license new products or applications for the FOSSL technology, or such products are not commercially viable, we may not realize the full benefits of our agreements with Philips which would harm our results of operations and could delay and or impair our ability to successfully commercialize that technology.\nThe realization of the full potential benefits of our agreements with Philips, including the receipt of any of the up to $78.0 million in future payments associated with the successful commercialization by Philips or its collaborators of products containing the FOSSL technology, requires the development of new products and applications of technology that are subject to design, engineering and manufacturing challenges, potential safety and regulatory issues that could delay, suspend or terminate clinical studies, regulatory approvals or sales, and our reliance on third parties to develop, obtain regulatory approval for, manufacture, market and sell products containing FOSSL technology. Approximately two-thirds of the up to $78.0 million of potential future payments could arise from Philips\u2019 sublicensing the FOSSL technology, but Philips has no obligations to do so. Under certain circumstances, we have the right to reacquire certain of the rights licensed to Philips for an amount which in the aggregate would be greater than the upfront payment amounts received by us from Philips in connection with the agreements related to the FOSSL technology, however, there can be no assurance that we would have the capital resources to exercise such rights or that we could find another commercial partner or develop commercially such technologies. In addition, Philips\u2019 sales of products containing the FOSSL technology could be sufficient to result in our not having any rights to reacquire any of the rights licensed to Philips, yet too low to result in any royalty payments to us. If any of these events occurs, we would be unable to realize the full financial benefits of our agreements with Philips and may be delayed or unable to monetize the FOSSL technology in other areas, harming our research and development efforts and adversely affecting our business.\nWe may be unable to complete our clinical trial for the treatment of atrial fibrillation or other future trials, or we may experience significant delays in completing our clinical trials, which could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our Sensei system for expanded uses and impair our financial position.\nWe have received approval of an IDE application to investigate the use of our Sensei system and Artisan Control and Artisan Extend catheters in the treatment of atrial fibrillation in a clinical study designed to support the expansion of our current labeling in the U.S. beyond mapping. The study was planned to involve approximately 300 patients and involves the treatment of atrial fibrillation. We enrolled our first patient in May 2010 and approximately 50 patients were enrolled as of January 2013. A proposed modification to the study protocol was submitted to FDA for review in January 2013, to change the study design and reduce the required sample size. The modified study, which plans to enroll a minimum of 125 additional subjects, was approved by the FDA in August 2013 and approximately three-fourths of the target number of additional subjects have been enrolled to date. The study includes a seven-day follow-up for safety and a one-year follow-up for efficacy at intervals of 90, 180, and 365 days.\nEnrollment of additional patients in the trial could be delayed for a variety of reasons, including:\n\u2022\nreaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\nobtaining additional IRB approval to conduct the trial at prospective sites; and\n\u2022\nobtaining sufficient patient enrollment, which is a function of many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the protocol, the willingness of patients to participate in a clinical trial, the proximity of patients to clinical sites and the eligibility criteria for the trial.\nIn addition, the completion of the trial, and any future clinical trials, could be delayed, suspended or terminated for several reasons, including:\n\u2022\nongoing discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the scope or design of our preclinical results or clinical trial or requests for supplemental information with respect to our preclinical results or clinical trial results;\n\u2022\nour failure or inability to conduct the clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nsites participating in the trial may drop out of the trial, which may require us to engage new sites or petition the FDA for an expansion of the number of sites that are permitted to be involved in the trial;\n\u2022\npatients may not enroll in, remain in or complete the clinical trial at the rates we expect;\n\u2022\npatients in either the control or test arm of the trial may experience serious adverse events or side effects during the trial, which, whether or not related to our products, could cause the FDA or other regulatory authorities to place the clinical trial on hold; and\n\u2022\nclinical investigators may not perform our clinical trials on our anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol and good clinical practices.\nIf our clinical trials are delayed it will take us longer to commercialize a product for the treatment of atrial fibrillation and generate revenues from such product. Moreover, our development costs will increase if we have material delays in our clinical trials or if we need to perform more or larger clinical trials than planned.\nEven if we complete our trial for the treatment of atrial fibrillation or other clinical trials, these trials may not produce results that are sufficient to support approval of a PMA or 510(k) application.\nWe will consider our Sensei system to be effective for the treatment of atrial fibrillation if the trial for the treatment of atrial fibrillation meets target performance goals based upon the manual control of the NaviStar Thermocool catheter, but there is a risk that, even if we achieve our trial endpoints, the FDA may not approve our Sensei system for use in the treatment of atrial fibrillation. In addition, there is a risk that the FDA may require us\nto conduct a larger or longer clinical trial, submit additional follow-up data, or engage in other costly and time consuming activities that may delay the FDA\u2019s clearance or approval of the Sensei system for use in atrial fibrillation. Although we plan to file a 510(k) application based on data from our trial for the use of Sensei system in the treatment of atrial fibrillation, the FDA may require us to file a premarket approval, or PMA, which is more time consuming and costly. If our clinical trials fail to produce sufficient data to support a PMA or 510(k) application, it will take us longer to ultimately commercialize a product for the treatment of atrial fibrillation, or any other intended treatment, and generate revenue or the delay could result in our being unable to do so. Moreover, our development costs will increase if we need to perform more or larger clinical trials than planned.\nWe have incurred substantial management and employee turnover and we may lose additional key personnel or fail to attract and retain additional personnel needed for us to operate our business effectively.\nOur management team includes several members hired since January 2014, including our new Chief Executive Officer who joined us in May 2014. In addition, the position of Chief Financial Officer is currently held on an interim basis. If we are unable to recruit and retain qualified individuals, including retaining our new Chief Executive Officer and hiring a full-time Chief Financial Officer, our product development and commercialization efforts could be materially delayed or be unsuccessful. We have periodically reduced our work force and we may undertake additional actions to reduce our work force in the future. These reductions in force may make it more difficult to retain and attract the qualified personnel required, placing a significant strain on our management. Accordingly, retaining such personnel and recruiting necessary new employees in the future will be critical to our success. There is intense competition from other companies and research and academic institutions for qualified personnel in the areas of our activities. If we fail to identify, attract, retain and motivate these highly skilled management and personnel, we may be unable to continue our development and commercialization activities and our business will be harmed.\nWe are highly dependent on the principal members of our management and scientific staff. We do not carry \u201ckey person\u201d insurance covering any members of our senior management. Each of our officers and key employees may terminate his or her employment at any time without notice and without cause or good reason. The loss of any of these persons could prevent the implementation and completion of our objectives, including the development and introduction of our products, and could require the remaining management members to direct immediate and substantial attention to seeking a replacement.\nCredit, financial market and general economic conditions could delay or prevent potential customers from purchasing our products, which would adversely affect our sales, financial condition and results of operation.\nThe sale of our systems often represents a significant capital purchase for our customers and many customers finance their purchase of our systems through a credit facility or other financing. If prospective customers that need to finance their capital purchases are not able to access the credit or capital markets on terms that they consider acceptable, they may decide to postpone or cancel a potential purchase of one of our systems. Potential customers with limited capital budgets may decide to spend those dollars on other technologies rather than on our products. Also, even customers with sufficient financial resources to make such purchases without resorting to the credit and capital markets may be less likely to make capital purchases during periods when they view the overall economic conditions unfavorably or with uncertainty. Many potential customers have delayed making a decision to purchase a Sensei system, which has significantly impacted our sales, financial condition and results of operations. If we are unable to obtain market acceptance for our products\u2019 value proposition, potential customers may not make these significant capital purchases and our sales, financial condition and results of operations would be harmed.\nWe have limited sales, marketing and distribution experience and capabilities, which could impair our ability to achieve sustained profitability.\nIn the United States, we market our systems and catheters through a direct sales force of regional sales employees, supported by clinical sales representatives who provide training, clinical support and other services to our customers. Our direct sales force competes against the experienced and well-funded sales organizations of our competitors. Our revenues will depend largely on the effectiveness of our sales force. We face significant challenges and risks related to our direct sales force and the marketing of our current and future products, including, among others:\n\u2022\nthe ability of sales personnel to obtain access to or persuade adequate numbers of hospitals to purchase our system and catheters or physicians to use our system and catheters;\n\u2022\nour ability to retain, properly motivate, recruit and train adequate numbers of qualified sales and marketing personnel;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully integrate new management, including our Chief Executive Officer;\n\u2022\nthe costs associated with an independent sales and marketing organization, hiring, maintaining and expanding an independent sales and marketing organization; and\n\u2022\nour ability to promote our products effectively while maintaining compliance with government regulations and labeling restrictions with respect to the healthcare industry.\nOutside the United States, primarily in the European Union, we are establishing a combination of a direct sales force and distributors to market, sell and support our current and future products. If we fail to select and maintain appropriate distributors, appropriately disengage from unsuccessful distributors or effectively use our distributors or sales personnel and coordinate our efforts for distribution of our systems and catheters in the European Union or if their and our sales and marketing strategies are not effective in generating sales of our system, our revenues would be adversely affected and we may never become profitable on a sustained basis.\nWe have limited experience in manufacturing and assembling our products and may encounter problems at our manufacturing facilities or otherwise experience manufacturing delays that could result in lost revenue or diminishing margins.\nWe do not have significant experience in manufacturing, assembling or testing our current products on a commercial scale. In addition, for our Sensei system and Magellan Robotic System, we subcontract the manufacturing of major components and complete the final assembly and testing of those components in-house. We face challenges in order to produce our Sensei system and disposable catheters effectively, to appropriately phase in new products such as the Magellan Robotic System and product designs, to efficiently utilize our manufacturing facility and to achieve planned manufacturing cost reductions. These challenges include equipment design and automation, material procurement, low or variable production yields on catheters and quality control and assurance. The costs resulting from these challenges have had and will continue to have a significant impact on our gross margins and may result in significant fluctuations of gross margins from quarter to quarter. We may not successfully complete required manufacturing changes or planned improvements in manufacturing efficiency on a timely basis or at all. If we are unable to satisfy demand for our systems or catheters, our ability to generate revenue could be impaired and hospitals may instead purchase, or physicians may use, our competitors\u2019 products. Since our Sensei system and Magellan Robotic System require the use of disposable Artisan catheters and Magellan Robotic Catheters, respectively, our failure to meet demand for catheters from hospitals that have purchased our systems could adversely affect the market acceptance of our products and damage our commercial reputation.\nIn addition, all of our operations are conducted at our facilities leased in Mountain View, California. We could encounter problems at these facilities, which could delay or prevent us from manufacturing, assembling or testing our products or maintaining our manufacturing capabilities or otherwise conducting operations.\nOur reliance on third-party manufacturers and on suppliers, and in certain cases, a single-source supplier, could harm our ability to meet demand for our products in a timely manner or within budget, and could cause harm to our business and financial condition.\nWe depend on third-party manufacturers to produce most of the components of our systems and other current products, and have not entered into formal agreements with several of these third parties. We also depend on various third-party suppliers for various components we use in our systems and for our catheters and sheaths. For example, Force Dimension S\u00e0rl, a single-source supplier, manufactures customized motion controllers that are a part of our Sensei system and Magellan Robotic System. We also obtain the motors for our Sensei system and Magellan Robotic System from a single supplier, Maxon Motor AG, from whom we purchase on a purchase order basis, and we generally do not maintain large volumes of inventory.\nOur reliance on third parties involves a number of risks, including, among other things, the risk that:\n\u2022\nsuppliers may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or make errors in manufacturing components that could negatively affect the efficacy or safety of our products or cause delays in or prevent shipments of our products;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to respond to unanticipated changes and increases in customer orders;\n\u2022\nwe may be subject to price fluctuations due to a lack of long-term supply arrangements for key components with our suppliers;\n\u2022\nwe may lose access to critical services and components, resulting in an interruption in the manufacture, assembly and shipment of our systems and other products;\n\u2022\nour suppliers manufacture products for a range of customers, and fluctuations in demand for products these suppliers manufacture for others may affect their ability to deliver components to us in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nour suppliers may wish to discontinue supplying goods or services to us;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to find new or alternative components for our use or reconfigure our system and manufacturing processes in a timely manner if the components necessary for our system become unavailable; and\n\u2022\nour suppliers may encounter financial hardships unrelated to our demand for components, which could inhibit their ability to fulfill our orders and meet our requirements.\nIf any of these risks materialize, it could significantly increase our costs and impact our ability to meet demand for our products.\nIn addition, if these manufacturers or suppliers stop providing us with the components or services necessary for the operation of our business, we may not be able to identify alternative sources in a timely fashion. Any transition to alternative manufacturers or suppliers or a decision to discontinue our relationship with a current manufacturer or supplier could result in operational problems, increased expenses or write-down of capitalized assets that would adversely affect operating results and could delay the shipment of, or limit our ability to provide, our products. We cannot assure you that we would be able to enter into agreements with new manufacturers or suppliers on commercially reasonable terms on a timely basis or at all. Additionally, obtaining components from a new supplier may require qualification of a new supplier in the form of a new or supplemental filing with applicable regulatory authorities and clearance or approval of the filing before we could resume purchasing components for inclusion in our products. Any disruptions in product supply may harm our ability to generate revenues, lead to customer dissatisfaction, damage our reputation and result in additional costs or cancellation of orders by our customers. We currently purchase a number of the components for our systems in foreign jurisdictions. Any event causing a disruption of imports, including the imposition of import restrictions, could adversely affect our business and our financial condition.\nIf we fail to maintain necessary FDA clearances/approvals and the CE Certificates of Conformity for our medical device products or are seen to violate any FDA or EEA regulations or guidance, or if future clearances, approvals or the delivery of CE Certificates of Conformity are delayed, we will be unable to commercially distribute and market our products.\nThe process of seeking regulatory clearance, or approval (in the United States) or CE Certificates of Conformity (in the EEA) to market a medical device is expensive and time-consuming and clearance, approval and grant of CE Certificates of Conformity is never guaranteed and, even if granted or obtained, clearance, approval or CE Certificates of Conformity may be suspended, withdrawn or revoked. Staying in compliance with all of the complex FDA and EEA regulations and guidance is a time-consuming and difficult endeavor, and the government may disagree with our compliance efforts or interpretations of FDA regulations and guidance. If the FDA or the competent authorities of the EEA countries determine that our promotional materials or training constitutes promotion of a use which has not been cleared or approved or does not fall within the scope of the current CE mark, they could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of an untitled letter, a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine and criminal penalties.\nIn May 2007, we received FDA clearance in the United States to commercialize our Sensei system and Artisan catheters only to facilitate manipulation, positioning and control, for collecting electrophysiological data within the heart atria with electro-anatomic mapping and recording systems using two specified mapping catheters. Because the FDA has determined that there is a reasonable likelihood that our Sensei system and Artisan catheters could be used by physicians for uses not encompassed by the scope of the present label and that such uses may cause harm, we are required to label these products to state that their safety and effectiveness for use with cardiac ablation catheters in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation have not been established. Accordingly, the scope of the current label may hinder our ability to successfully market and sell our EP products in the United States to a broader group of potential customers.\nWe received FDA clearance to commercialize our Magellan Robotic System including the catheter and accessories in June 2012 and we received FDA clearance for the marketing of our Magellan 6Fr Robotic Catheter in February 2014. Our FDA cleared labeling does not further specify the scope of the targets within the peripheral vasculature that are encompassed in the 510(k) clearance. The FDA could disagree with our interpretation of the scope of this clearance. If the FDA concludes that our promotional materials exceed the scope of this clearance, the agency may retroactively require us to seek 510(k) clearance or PMA approval and such uses could be subject to the same restrictions as the use of the Sensei system in cardiac ablation procedures.\nOur promotional materials and training methods regarding physicians must comply with FDA limitations and other applicable laws and regulations. Both our Magellan and Sensei systems are cleared by the FDA and CE marked in the EEA for defined uses. We believe that the specific procedures for which our products are marketed fall within the scope of the FDA clearances in the United States and CE marks in the EEA. The FDA and other competent authorities and agencies actively enforce regulations prohibiting promotion of off-label uses and the promotion of products for which marketing clearance, approval or CE Certificates of Conformity has not been obtained. Moreover, scrutiny of such practices by the FDA, the U.S. Department of Justice, and other competent authorities and agencies has recently increased. In the United States, promotional activities for FDA regulated products of other companies have been the subject of enforcement action brought under healthcare reimbursement laws and consumer protection statutes. A company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including civil and administrative remedies under the Federal False Claims Act and various other federal and state laws, as well as criminal sanctions. Administrative, civil and criminal sanctions can also be imposed in foreign countries.\nWe will be required to seek a separate 510(k) clearance or PMA approval to market our Sensei system for uses other than those in the current label. We cannot assure you that the FDA would not impose a more burdensome level of premarket review on other intended uses or modifications to approved products. We plan to seek future approval of our Sensei system for other indications, including atrial fibrillation and other cardiac ablation procedures. We have received approval of an IDE application to investigate the use of our Artisan family of\ncatheters in the treatment of atrial fibrillation in a clinical study designed to support the expansion of our current labeling in the U.S. beyond mapping. The study was planned to involve approximately 300 patients and involves the treatment of atrial fibrillation. We enrolled our first patient in May 2010 and approximately 50 patients were enrolled as of January 2013. A proposed modification to the study protocol was submitted to FDA for review in April 2013. The modified study, which plans to enroll a minimum of 125 additional subjects, was approved by the FDA in August 2013 and approximately three-fourths of the targeted number of additional subjects have been enrolled to date. The study will include a seven-day follow-up for safety and a one-year follow-up for efficacy at intervals of 90, 180, and 365 days. We cannot assure the timing or potential for success of those efforts. We cannot assure you that the study will be completed at all or in a timely manner, nor that the study will be executed in a manner consistent with FDA requirements or yield sufficient data to support approval. Clinical studies are subject to FDA audits under the Bioresearch Monitoring program, and if our study execution or that of our participating sites and investigators is found to be deficient, this may result in delays in approval or could prevent approval from being obtained. Any significant violations can also result in further enforcement action, as outlined above.\nWith regard to our Sensei system, our Magellan Robotic System, or other products, the FDA can delay, limit or deny clearance of a 510(k), or PMA approval, for many reasons, including:\n\u2022\nour inability to demonstrate safety or effectiveness to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction;\n\u2022\nthe data from our preclinical studies and clinical trials may be insufficient to support approval;\n\u2022\nthe facilities of our third-party manufacturers or suppliers may not meet applicable requirements;\n\u2022\nour failure to comply with preclinical, clinical or other regulations;\n\u2022\nour inability to meet the FDA\u2019s statistical requirements or changes in statistical tests or significance levels the FDA requires for approval of a medical device, including ours; and\n\u2022\nchanges in the FDA approval policies, expectations with regard to the type or amount of scientific data required or adoption of new regulations that may require additional data or additional clinical studies.\nFurthermore, in order to market our products outside of the United States, we will need to establish and comply with the numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding quality, safety and efficacy. We received a CE Certificate of Conformity in the EEA for our Sensei system in September 2006, for our Artisan catheters in May 2007, for our Magellan Robotic System in July 2011, for our Magellan Robotic Catheter and related accessories designed for use with the Magellan Robotic System in October 2011, for our Artisan Extend catheters in February 2013, and for our Magellan 6Fr Robotic Catheter in November 2014. However, we may be required to go through new conformity assessment procedures with our Notified Body in the EEA in order to market our products for any additional uses. Regulatory approvals or CE Certificates of Conformity may be difficult and costly to obtain, or may not be granted or obtained at all.\nIf we are unable to maintain our regulatory clearances and CE Certificates of Conformity and obtain future clearances and CE Certificates of Conformity for our products and be seen to be in full compliance with the relevant FDA regulations and guidance, our financial condition and cash flow may be adversely affected, and our ability to grow domestically and internationally may be limited.\nIf the FDA or U.S. Department of Justice takes the position that we are not marketing or training physicians in a manner consistent with FDA regulations, the FDA and the competent authorities in the EEA countries could require us to stop promoting our products for certain procedures until we obtain FDA clearance or approval or a specific CE Certificate of Conformity for them and/or could require us to initiate corrective actions that could include issuing corrective advertising. In addition, the FDA and the competent authorities in the EEA countries could require us to generate and submit significant quality, safety and efficacy data to support use in those procedures for which the agency or the competent authorities of the EEA countries require clearance, approval or a specific CE Certificate of Conformity. If we are perceived not to be in compliance with all of the governmental restrictions, we could be subject to various enforcement measures, including investigations, administrative\nproceedings and country, federal and state court litigation, which would likely be costly to defend and harmful to our business. If the FDA, the U.S. Department of Justice, or another competent authority ultimately concludes we are not in compliance with such restrictions, we could be subject to significant liability, including civil and administrative remedies, exclusion, injunctions, significant monetary and punitive penalties and criminal sanctions, any or all of which would be harmful to our business and in certain instances may cause us to have to cease operations.\nIf physicians and hospitals do not believe that our Sensei system and Artisan catheters are a viable alternative to existing mapping technologies used in atrial fibrillation and other cardiac ablation procedures, or if they do not believe that our Magellan Robotic System and Magellan Robotic Catheters are a viable alternative for vascular diseases, they may choose not to use our products.\nWe believe that physicians will not use, and hospitals will not purchase, our systems unless they determine that they provide a safe and effective alternative to existing treatments. Since we have received FDA clearance to market our Sensei system and disposable Artisan catheters only for guiding catheters to map the heart anatomy, we will not be able to label or promote these products, or train physicians, for use in guiding catheters for cardiac ablation until such clearance or approval is obtained. Currently, there is only limited clinical data on our Sensei system with which to assess its safety and efficacy in any procedure, including atrial fibrillation and other cardiac ablation procedures. A number of studies have been published since the commercial launch of our Sensei system in 2007 on the efficacy, safety and efficiency of our products, especially by comparison to manual techniques. While we believe many of those studies have demonstrated the benefits of our products, some of these studies have been cited by our competitors to portray our products in an unfavorable light. A number of additional studies are underway both in the United States and Europe assessing the clinical experience with our products and continuing to compare usability and success of treatment between procedures performed with our Sensei system and manual technique. If these studies, or other clinical studies performed by us or others, or clinical experience indicate that procedures with our Sensei system or the type of procedures that can be performed with the Sensei system are not effective or safe for such uses, physicians may choose not to use our Sensei system. Reluctance by physicians to use our Sensei system or to perform procedures enabled by the Sensei system would harm sales. Furthermore, we commenced the commercialization of our Magellan Robotic System and Magellan Robotic Catheters for the treatment of vascular diseases, but there is very little clinical data for the system\u2019s safety and efficacy. Reluctance by physicians to use our Magellan Robotic System or to perform procedures enabled by the Magellan Robotic System would harm these sales. Further, unsatisfactory patient outcomes or patient injury in either of our major products could cause negative publicity for our products, particularly in the early phases of product introduction. In addition, physicians may be slow to adopt our products if they perceive liability risks arising from the use of these new products. It is also possible that as our products become more widely used, latent or other defects could be identified, creating negative publicity and liability problems for us, thereby adversely affecting demand for our products. If physicians do not adopt the use of our products in their practices, we likely will not become profitable on a sustained basis and our business will be harmed.\nIn addition, our research and development efforts and our marketing strategy depend heavily on obtaining support and collaboration from highly regarded physicians at leading hospitals. If we are unable to gain or maintain such support and collaboration, our ability to market our Sensei system and Magellan Robotic System and, as a result, our business and results of operations, could be harmed.\nWe expect to derive substantially all of our revenues from sales of our Sensei system, our Magellan Robotic System and the associated catheters and accessories. If hospitals do not purchase our systems, we may not generate sufficient revenues to continue our operations.\nOur initial commercial offering consisted primarily of two products, our Sensei system and our corresponding disposable Artisan catheters. The Sensei system has been supplemented by an optional CoHesion Module. In order for us to achieve sales, hospitals must purchase our Sensei system and Artisan catheters. We also received the CE Mark in Europe for our Magellan Robotic System in July 2011 and for the Magellan\nRobotic Catheter and related accessories designed for use with the Magellan Robotic System in October 2011. We received FDA clearance to commercialize our Magellan Robotic System including the catheter and accessories in June 2012 and we received FDA clearance for the marketing of our Magellan 6Fr Robotic Catheter in February 2014. If hospitals do not widely adopt our Sensei system or Magellan Robotic System, or if they decide that our systems are too expensive to purchase or operate, we may never achieve significant revenue or become profitable. Such a failure to adequately sell our Sensei system or Magellan Robotic System would have a materially detrimental impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe training required for physicians to use our Sensei system and Magellan Robotic System could reduce the market acceptance of our system and reduce our revenue.\nIt is critical to the success of our sales efforts to ensure that there are a sufficient number of physicians familiar with, trained on and proficient in the use of our Sensei system and Magellan Robotic System. Convincing physicians to dedicate the time and energy necessary for adequate training in the use of our systems is challenging, and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in these efforts.\nIt is our policy to train U.S. physicians to only insert, navigate, map and remove catheters using our Sensei system. Physicians must obtain training elsewhere to learn how to ablate cardiac tissue to treat atrial fibrillation, which is an off-label procedure with our Sensei system. This training may be provided in the U.S. by third parties, such as hospitals and universities and through independent peer-to-peer training among doctors. We cannot assure you that a sufficient number of U.S. physicians will become aware of training programs or that physicians will dedicate the time, funds and energy necessary for adequate training in the use of our system for these off-label procedures. Additionally, we will have no control over the quality of these training programs. If physicians are not properly trained, they may misuse or ineffectively use our products. This may result in unsatisfactory outcomes, patient injury, negative publicity or lawsuits against us, any of which could negatively affect our reputation and sales of our products. Furthermore, our inability to educate and train U.S. physicians to use our Sensei system for cardiac ablation procedures may lead to inadequate demand for our products and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nWe monitor our training to ensure that off-label use is not promoted or enabled. However, from time to time, we may sponsor third party training. There is a risk that independent peer-to-peer interaction between physicians and other third party training may include discussion or observation of off-label procedures because most procedures performed to date using the Sensei system involve both mapping and cardiac ablation. If any such activities are attributed to us, the FDA or other governmental entities could conclude that we have engaged in off-label promotion of our products, which could subject us to significant liability.\nWe expect to continue to experience extended and variable sales cycles, which could cause significant variability in our results of operations for any given quarter.\nOur systems have a lengthy sales cycle because they involve a relatively expensive capital equipment purchase, which generally requires the approval of senior management at hospitals, inclusion in the hospitals\u2019 budget process for capital expenditures and, in some instances, a certificate of need from the state or other regulatory clearance. We continue to estimate that this sales cycle may take between six and 18 months, though we have seen sales cycles lengthen towards the longer end of this range as many potential customers have postponed purchase decisions. Additionally, the majority of our revenue is often shipped in the last weeks of a given quarter. Any disruption in our supply chain during those critical weeks or an inability to fulfill our deliverables during that compressed time frame could significantly impact the timing of our ability to recognize revenue on those items. These factors have contributed in the past and may contribute in the future to substantial fluctuations in our quarterly operating results, particularly in the near term and during any other periods in which our sales volume is relatively low. As a result, in future quarters our operating results could differ from our announcements of guidance regarding future operating or financial results or may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, in which event our stock price would likely decrease. These fluctuations also\nmean that you will not be able to rely upon our operating results in any particular period as an indication of future performance. In addition, the introduction of new products such as our Magellan Robotic System and Magellan Robotic Catheters could adversely impact our sales cycle, as customers take additional time to assess the benefits of new investments in capital products.\nThe use of our products could result in product liability claims that could be expensive, divert management\u2019s attention and harm our reputation and business.\nOur business exposes us to significant risks of product liability claims that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of medical devices. Moreover, the FDA has expressed concerns regarding the safety and efficacy of our Sensei system for ablation and other therapeutic indications, including for the treatment of atrial fibrillation and has specifically instructed that our products be labeled to inform our customers that the safety and effectiveness of our technology for use with cardiac ablation catheters in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, including for atrial fibrillation, have not been established. We presently believe that to date, all of the procedures in which our Sensei system has been used in the United States have included off-label uses such as cardiac ablation, for which our Sensei system and Artisan catheters have not been cleared by the FDA and which therefore could increase the risk of product liability claims. The medical device industry has historically been subject to extensive litigation over product liability claims. We may be subject to claims by consumers, healthcare providers, third-party payors or others selling our products if the use of our products were to cause, or merely appear to cause, injury or death. Any weakness in training and services associated with our products may also result in product liability lawsuits. Although we maintain clinical trial liability and product liability insurance, the coverage is subject to deductibles and limitations, and may not be adequate to cover future claims. Additionally, we may be unable to maintain our existing product liability insurance in the future at satisfactory rates or adequate amounts. A product liability claim, regardless of its merit or eventual outcome could result in:\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for our products;\n\u2022\ninjury to our reputation;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022\nsignificant costs of related litigation;\n\u2022\npayment of substantial monetary awards to patients;\n\u2022\nproduct recalls or market withdrawals;\n\u2022\nloss of revenue; and\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize our products under development.\nOur products and related technologies can be applied in different applications, and we may fail to focus on the most profitable areas or we may be unable to address successfully financial and technology risks associated with new applications, including applications for the vascular market.\nWe may be unable to develop or commercialize our technology for additional applications. The technology underlying our systems is designed to have the potential for applications beyond EP and vascular disease which require a control catheter to approach diseased tissue. We further believe that the technology underlying our system can provide multiple opportunities to improve the speed and capability of many diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. However, we may be unable, due to limited financial or managerial resources, to develop these applications and seek a separate 510(k) clearance or PMA approval from the FDA for these applications of our technology. Also, due to our limited financial and managerial resources, we may be required to focus on products in selected applications and to forego efforts with regard to other products and industries including expansion of our EP and vascular applications as well as the development of other applications. Failure to\ncapitalize on other applications for our technology may limit the addressable market for our products and our ability to grow our revenues and expand our operations.\nWe are dedicating significant resources to the development and commercialization of our Magellan Robotic System, Magellan Robotic Catheters and associated accessories. These efforts may not produce viable commercial products and may divert our limited resources from more profitable market opportunities. Moreover, we may devote resources to developing products in additional areas but may be unable to justify the value proposition or otherwise develop a commercial market for products we develop in these areas, if any. In that case, the return on investment in these additional areas may be limited, which could negatively affect our results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain collaborative relationships with providers of imaging and visualization technology on terms favorable to us, or at all, our Sensei system may not be able to gain market acceptance and our business may be harmed.\nOur success depends on our ability to continually enhance and broaden our product offerings in response to changing technologies, customer demands and competitive pressures. We believe that integrating our Sensei system with key imaging and visualization technologies using an open architecture approach is a key element in establishing our Sensei system as important for complex interventional procedures. Our Sensei system currently utilizes a variety of imaging means to visualize and assist in navigating our catheters. These imaging systems include fluoroscopy, intravascular ultrasound and electro-anatomic mapping systems, as well as pre-operatively acquired three-dimensional computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. We believe that in the future, as imaging companies develop increasingly sophisticated three-dimensional imaging systems, we will need to integrate advanced imaging into our Sensei system in order to compete effectively. There can be no assurance that we can timely and effectively integrate these systems or components into our Sensei system in order to remain competitive. We expect to face competition from companies that are developing new approaches and products for use in interventional procedures and that have an established presence in the field of interventional cardiology, including the major imaging, capital equipment and disposables companies that are currently selling products in the electrophysiology laboratory. We may not be able to acquire or develop three- dimensional imaging and visualization technology for use with our Sensei system. In addition, developing or acquiring key imaging and visualization technologies could be expensive and time-consuming and may not integrate well with our Sensei system. If we are unable to timely acquire, develop or integrate imaging and visualization technologies, or any other changing technologies, effectively, our revenue may decline and our business will suffer.\nIn April 2007, we entered into agreements with St. Jude Medical, Inc., or St. Jude, to integrate our Sensei system with St. Jude\u2019s Ensite system and to co-market the integrated product. We are not obligated to undertake any other development projects except for the integration of the Sensei system with the EnSite system. We are solely responsible for gaining regulatory approvals for, and all costs associated with, our portion of the integrated products developed under the arrangement. At the end of the second quarter of 2008, the FDA cleared for marketing in the United States our CoHesion Module, which provides an interface between our Sensei system and the EnSite system; however, there can be no assurance that we will successfully maintain necessary regulatory clearances that we and St. Jude will maintain compatibility of our products under the collaboration or that the CoHesion Module will gain market acceptance. In August 2010, we entered into an agreement with St. Jude permitting us to integrate St. Jude\u2019s EnSite Velocity Cardiac Mapping System with our CoHesion Module to provide physicians the ability to visualize, locate and robotically control catheters within the heart to diagnose heart rhythm disorders. This agreement was amended in February 2014 and expired at the end of December 2014. If the agreement is not extended at a future date, we may be unable to maintain our ability to offer integration with the EnSite Velocity System with new system sales, or to maintain compatibility with updated or upgraded versions of EnSite Velocity, which could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nIndemnification obligations to our current and former directors and officers and contractual indemnification obligations to underwriters of our securities offerings could adversely affect our ability to defend claims for which we may be liable, our results of operations, our financial condition and our cash flows.\nUnder Delaware law, our charter documents and certain indemnification agreements, we may have an obligation to indemnify our current and former officers, employees and directors under certain circumstances. In addition, we have contractual indemnification obligations to the underwriters and placement agents in our prior public and private offerings, as applicable, of our equity securities. Some of these advancement and indemnification obligations may not be covered by our directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance policies or may exceed the coverage limits of those policies. If we incur significant uninsured advancement or indemnity obligations, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to defend claims for which we may be liable, our results of operations, our financial condition and our cash flows.\nFuture acquisitions could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and operating results.\nOur success will depend, in part, on our ability to expand our offerings and markets and grow our business in response to changing technologies, customer demands and competitive pressures. In some circumstances, we may determine to do so through the acquisition of complementary businesses, solutions or technologies rather than through internal development. The identification of suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult, time-consuming and costly, and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisitions. Furthermore, even if we successfully complete an acquisition, we may not be able to successfully assimilate and integrate the business, technologies, solutions, personnel or operations of the company that we acquired, particularly if key personnel of an acquired company decide not to work for us. In addition, we may issue equity securities to complete an acquisition, which would dilute our stockholders\u2019 ownership and could adversely affect the price of our common stock. Acquisitions may also involve the entry into geographic or business markets in which we have little or no prior experience. Consequently, we may not achieve anticipated benefits of the acquisitions which could harm our operating results.\nSoftware defects may be discovered in our products which would damage our ability to sell our products, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur systems incorporate sophisticated computer software. Complex software frequently contains errors, especially when first introduced. Because our products are designed to be used to perform complex interventional procedures, we expect that physicians and hospitals will have an increased sensitivity to the potential for software and other defects. We cannot assure you that our software will not experience errors or performance problems in the future. If we experience software errors or performance problems, we would likely also experience:\n\u2022\nloss of revenue;\n\u2022\nan increase in reportable adverse events to applicable authorities such as the FDA;\n\u2022\ndelay in market acceptance of our products;\n\u2022\ndamage to our reputation;\n\u2022\nadditional regulatory filings;\n\u2022\nproduct recalls;\n\u2022\nincreased service or warranty costs; and/or\n\u2022\nproduct liability claims relating to the software defects.\nOur costs could substantially increase if we receive a significant number of service claims which would harm our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe typically provide post-contract customer service for each of our products against defects in materials and workmanship for a period of approximately 12 months from the date of shipment of our product. The associated expenses are charged to cost of revenues as incurred. We have a limited history of commercial placements of our Sensei systems and a very limited history of commercial placements of our Magellan Robotic Systems from which to judge our rate of claims against our service contracts. Our obligation under these service contracts may be impacted by product failure rates, material usage and service costs. Unforeseen exposure under these post-contract customer service contracts could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nHospitals or physicians may be unable to obtain coverage or reimbursement from third-party payors for procedures using our Sensei system and Magellan Robotic System, which could affect the adoption or use of our systems and may cause our revenues to decline.\nWhile we anticipate that third-party payors will continue to reimburse hospitals and physicians under existing billing codes for the vast majority of the procedures involving our products, there is increased pressure for our customers to reduce costs for their services and operations; similarly, the federal healthcare programs are under increasing pressure to reduce its overall costs for items and services. While we expect that healthcare facilities and physicians in the United States will continue to bill various third-party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid, other governmental programs and private insurers, for services performed using our products. We believe that procedures associated for use with our products are generally already reimbursable under government programs and most private plans, we are unable to predict how government healthcare programs or private insurers will cover or reimburse these procedures in the future. While providers in the United States will generally not be required to obtain new billing authorizations or codes in order to be compensated for performing medically necessary procedures using our products on insured patients, we are unable to predict how future statutes or regulatory guidance will impact coverage, reimbursement or the use of any specific codes.\nThus, there can be no assurance that coverage, coding and reimbursement policies of third-party payors will not change in the future with respect to some or all of the procedures that would use our systems. Additionally, in the event that a physician uses our Sensei system or Magellan Robotic System for indications not approved by the FDA, there can be no assurance that the coverage or reimbursement policies of third-party payors will be comparable to FDA-approved uses. Future legislation, regulation or coverage, coding and reimbursement policies of third-party payors may adversely affect the demand for our products currently under development and limit our ability to profitably sell our products. For example, in prior years, certain regulatory changes were made to the methodology for calculating payments for inpatient procedures in certain hospitals, resulting in a decrease to Medicare payment rates for surgical and cardiac procedures, including those procedures for which our products are targeted. The majority of the procedures performed with our Sensei system and Artisan catheter are done on an in-patient basis and thus are paid under the Medicare severity diagnosis related group, or MS-DRG system.\nWe believe that the majority of procedures performed using our Sensei technology fall under MS-DRG 251, percutaneous cardiovascular procedures without coronary artery stent or acute myocardial infarction without major cardiovascular complication. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services updates the MS-DRG payment rates annually effective October 1 through September 30 of the following year. Because hospital inpatient reimbursement is largely dependent on geographical location and other hospital-specific factors, an individual hospital\u2019s revenues from using our technology can vary significantly. At this time, although payments for these cardiac procedures have not undergone further reductions, we cannot predict the full impact any future rate changes, including rate reductions, will have on our revenues or business. We do not currently know which MS-DRGs will apply to procedures performed with our Magellan Robotic System or whether reimbursement amounts will be considered favorable by hospitals.\nOur success in international markets also depends upon the eligibility of our products for coverage and reimbursement by government-sponsored healthcare payment systems and third-party payors. Recent legislative initiatives in the United States to reform healthcare and government insurance programs have included a focus on healthcare costs which could limit the coverage and reimbursement for procedures utilizing our products. In both the United States and foreign markets, healthcare cost-containment efforts are prevalent and are expected to continue and may increase. The failure of our customers to obtain sufficient reimbursement could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and harm our business.\nLegislative reforms to the United States healthcare system may adversely affect our revenues and business.\nFrom time to time, legislative reform measures are proposed or adopted that would impact healthcare expenditures for medical services, including the medical devices used to provide those services. For example, in March 2010, U.S. President Barack Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively referred to as the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act made a number of substantial changes in the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers and the way that Medicare providers are reimbursed. Among other things, the Affordable Care Act requires certain medical device manufacturers and importers to pay an excise tax equal to 2.3% of the price for which such medical devices are sold, beginning January 1, 2013.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the President signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation\u2019s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2.0% per fiscal year. On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, or the ATRA, which delayed for another two months the budget cuts mandated by these sequestration provisions of the Budget Control Act of 2011. On March 1, 2013, the President signed an executive order implementing sequestration, and on April 1, 2013, the 2% Medicare payment reductions went into effect. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, enacted on December 26, 2013, extends these cuts to 2023. The ATRA also, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. In December 2014, Congress passed an omnibus funding bill (the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015) and a tax extenders bill, both of which may negatively impact coverage and reimbursement of healthcare items and services. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure.\nGovernment and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of health care costs, including price regulation, competitive pricing, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness reviews of therapies, technology assessments, and managed-care arrangements, are continuing. Government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health care insurance and managed-care plans have attempted to control costs by limiting the amount of reimbursement they will pay for particular procedures or treatments, tying reimbursement to outcomes, and other mechanisms designed to constrain utilization and contain costs, including delivery reforms such as expanded bundling of services. Hospitals are also seeking to reduce costs through a variety of mechanisms, which may increase price sensitivity among customers for our products, and adversely affect sales, pricing, and utilization of our products. Some third-party payors must also approve coverage for new or innovative devices or therapies before they will reimburse health care providers who use the medical devices or therapies. We cannot predict the potential impact of cost-containment trends on future operating results.\nNew regulations related to conflict minerals could adversely impact our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries. As a result, in August 2012, the SEC adopted annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use conflict minerals mined from the DRC and adjoining countries in their products. These new requirements required due diligence efforts in 2013 and 2014, with initial disclosure requirements beginning in May 2014. In May 2014, we filed a Specialized Disclosure Report on Form SD with the SEC disclosing our on-going diligence efforts and our determination that our products were conflict undeterminable at that time. We expect to file our next specialized Disclosure Report on Form SD with SEC in May 2015.\nThere have been and will be costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including for diligence to determine the sources of conflict minerals used in our products and other potential changes to products, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. The implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products. As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering \u201cconflict free\u201d conflict minerals, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary conflict minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we may implement.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations such as the recent RoHS directives, could cause a disruption in our business and operations.\nWe are subject to various state, federal and international laws and regulations governing the environment, including those restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products and making manufacturers of those products financially responsible for the collection, treatment and recycling and disposal of certain products. Such laws and regulations have been passed in several jurisdictions in which we operate, including various EU member countries. For example, the EU has enacted the WEEE directives. The WEEE directive obligates parties that place electrical and electronic equipment on the market in the EU to put a clearly identifiable mark on the equipment, register with and report to EU member countries regarding distribution of the equipment and provide a mechanism to take back and properly dispose of the equipment. Another example is the RoHS2 directives. On July 1, 2011, the Official Journal of the EU published the revised Directive 2011/65/EU (RoHS 2) on the restriction on the use of certain hazardous substances (six materials specifically identified) in electrical and electronic equipment. This revised Directive (RoHS2) became effective July 21, 2011. The EU used a time-phased approach and identified 10 categories of products that needed to meet these new standards at various start dates.\nCategory 8 includes medical devices and applies to our products. Compliance with this revised directive for category 8 was required by July 22, 2014. All new products held for commerce in the EU must be in compliance with RoHS 2 as of that date. Any remaining inventory that is not in compliance with RoHS2 will be used in products sold in non-EU countries. RoHS2 compliant products may be sold in both EU and non-EU countries. However, only RoHS2 compliant products may be sold in EU countries. In order to minimize duplicate inventory, we plan to produce all future products in compliance with RoHS2 in order to sell them in both EU and non-EU countries. We recently undertook the lengthy process of changing the materials and processes used, where necessary, to bring our products into compliance with RoHS2. As of the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form10-K, all of our products sold in the EU are RoHS2 compliant. There can be no assurance that similar programs will not be implemented in other jurisdictions resulting in additional costs, possible delays in delivering products, and even the discontinuance of existing and planned future product replacements if the cost were to become prohibitive.\nWe sell our systems internationally and are subject to various risks relating to such international activities which could adversely affect our international sales and operating performance.\nA portion of our current and future revenues will come from international sales. To expand internationally, we will need to hire, train and retain additional qualified personnel. Engaging in international business inherently involves a number of difficulties and risks, including:\n\u2022\nrequired compliance with existing and changing foreign regulatory requirements and laws;\n\u2022\nexport or import restrictions and controls relating to technology;\n\u2022\npricing pressure;\n\u2022\nlaws and business practices favoring local companies;\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles;\n\u2022\nshipping delays;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences, tariffs and other trade barriers;\n\u2022\ninternational terrorism and anti-American sentiment;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in penetrating markets in which our competitors\u2019 products are more established;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing intellectual property rights.\nIf one or more of these risks are realized, it could require us to dedicate significant resources to remedy the situation, and if we are unsuccessful at finding a solution, our revenue may decline.\nOur financial results are subject to currency fluctuations as a result of our international operations which could decrease our revenues.\nIn the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, approximately 48% of our total revenues were generated outside the United States. While some of these revenues were denominated in U.S. dollars, approximately 7% of our total revenues for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 were generated in other currencies. We translate results of transactions denominated in local currencies into U.S. dollars using market conversion rates applicable to the period in which the transaction is reported. As a result, changes in exchange rates during a period can unpredictably and adversely affect our consolidated operating results and our asset and liability balances, even if the underlying value of the item in its original currency has not changed. A hypothetical 5% increase in the United States dollar exchange rate used would have resulted in an immaterial decrease in revenues in the year ended December 31, 2014.\nWe may be liable for contamination or other harm caused by materials that we handle, and changes in environmental regulations could cause us to incur additional expense.\nOur research and development, manufacturing and clinical processes involve the handling of potentially harmful biological materials as well as other hazardous materials. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous and biological materials and we incur expenses relating to compliance with these laws and regulations. If violations of environmental, health and safety laws occur, we could be held liable for damages, penalties and costs of remedial actions. These expenses or this liability could have a significant negative impact on our financial condition. We may violate environmental, health and safety laws in the future as a result of human error, equipment failure or other causes.\nEnvironmental laws could become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations. We are subject to potentially conflicting and changing regulatory agendas of political, business and environmental groups. Changes to or restrictions on permitting requirements or processes, hazardous or biological material storage or handling might require an unplanned capital investment or relocation. Failure to comply with new or existing laws or regulations could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to protect the intellectual property contained in our products from use by third parties, our ability to compete in the market will be harmed.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on obtaining patent and other intellectual property protection for the technologies contained in our products, and on successfully defending our patents and other intellectual property against third party challenges. We expect to incur substantial costs in obtaining patents and, if necessary, defending our proprietary rights. The patent positions of medical device companies, including ours, can be highly uncertain and involve complex and evolving legal and factual questions. We do not know whether we will be able to obtain the patent protection we seek, or whether the protection we do obtain will be found valid and enforceable if challenged or that such patent protection will confer any significant commercial advantage. We also do not know whether we will be able to develop additional patentable proprietary technologies. If we fail to obtain adequate protection of our intellectual property, or if any protection we obtain is reduced or eliminated, others could use our intellectual property without compensating us, resulting in harm to our business. We may also determine that it is in our best interests to voluntarily challenge a third party\u2019s products or patents in litigation or administrative proceedings, including patent interferences or reexaminations. In the event that we seek to enforce any of our owned or exclusively licensed patents against an infringing party, it is likely that the party defending the claim will seek to invalidate the patents we assert, which, if successful could result in the loss of the entire patent or the relevant portion of our patent, which would not be limited to any particular party. Any litigation to enforce or defend our patent rights, even if we were to prevail, could be costly and time-consuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. Our competitors may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or products without infringing any of our patent or other intellectual property rights, or may design around our proprietary technologies.\nUnited States patents and patent applications may also be subject to interference proceedings and United States patents may be subject to reexamination proceedings and, starting in 2012, post grant and inter partes review in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, and foreign patents may be subject to opposition or comparable proceedings in the corresponding foreign patent offices, which proceedings could result in either loss of the patent or denial of the patent application, or loss or reduction in the scope of one or more of the claims of, the patent or patent application. In addition, such interference, reexamination, post grant review, inter partes review, and opposition proceedings may be costly. Some of our technology was, and continues to be, developed in conjunction with third parties, and thus there is a risk that such third parties may claim rights in our intellectual property. Thus, any patents that we own or license from others may provide limited or no protection against competitors. Our pending patent applications, those we may file in the future, or those we may license from third parties, may not result in patents being issued. If issued, they may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology.\nNon-payment or delay in payment of patent fees or annuities, whether intentional or unintentional, may result in loss of patents or patent rights important to our business. Many countries, including certain countries in Europe, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially diminish the value of the patent. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect\nintellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States, particularly in the field of medical products and procedures.\nOur trade secrets, nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions to protect unpatented technology provide only limited and possibly inadequate protection of our rights. As a result, third parties may be able to use our unpatented technology, and our ability to compete in the market would be reduced. In addition, employees, consultants and others who participate in developing our products or in commercial relationships with us may breach their agreements with us regarding our intellectual property, and we may not have adequate remedies for the breach.\nThird parties may assert that we are infringing their intellectual property rights which may result in litigation.\nSuccessfully commercializing our Sensei system, our Magellan Robotic System and any other products we may develop, will depend in part on our not infringing patents held by third parties. It is possible that one or more of our products, including those that we have developed in conjunction with third parties, infringes existing patents. From time to time, we have received, and likely will continue to receive, communications from third parties inviting us to license their patents or accusing us of infringement. There can be no assurance that a third party will not take further action, such as filing a patent infringement lawsuit, including a request for injunctive relief, to bar the manufacture and sale of our Sensei system in the United States or elsewhere or the sale of our Magellan Robotic System in Europe. We may also choose to defend ourselves by initiating litigation or administrative proceedings to clarify or seek a declaration of our rights. As competition in our market grows, the possibility of a patent infringement claim against us or litigation we will initiate increases.\nThere may be existing patents which may be broad enough to cover aspects of our future technology. In addition, because patent applications in many countries such as the United States are maintained under conditions of confidentiality and can take many years to issue, there may be applications now pending of which we are unaware and which may later result in issued patents that our products infringe. We do not know whether any of these patents, if challenged, would be upheld as valid, enforceable and infringed by our products or technology. We may be sued by, or become involved in an administrative proceeding with, one or more of these or other third parties. We cannot assure you that a court or administrative body would agree with any arguments or defenses we may present concerning the invalidity, unenforceability or non-infringement of any third-party patent. In addition to the issued patents of which we are aware, other parties may have filed, and in the future are likely to file, patent applications covering products that are similar or identical to ours. We cannot assure you that any patents issuing from applications will not cover our products or will not have priority over our own products and patent applications.\nWe may not be able to maintain or obtain all the licenses from third parties necessary or advisable for promoting, manufacturing and selling our Sensei system and our Magellan Robotic System, which may cause harm to our business, operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on technology that we license from others, including technology that is integral to our Sensei system and our Magellan Robotic System, such as patents and other intellectual property that we have co-exclusively licensed from Intuitive Surgical, or Intuitive. Under our agreement with Intuitive, we received the right to apply Intuitive\u2019s patent portfolio in the field of intravascular approaches for the diagnosis or treatment of cardiovascular, neurovascular and peripheral vascular diseases. To the extent that we develop or commercialize robotic capability outside the field of use covered by our license with Intuitive, which we may choose to do at some time in the future, we may not have the patent protection and the freedom to operate outside the field which is afforded by the license inside the field. Although we believe that there are opportunities for us to operate outside the licensed field of use without using Intuitive\u2019s intellectual property, Intuitive from time to time has told us that it believes certain of our past activities that have fallen outside the licensed field have infringed its intellectual property rights. Although we disagree with Intuitive\u2019s position, we presently remain focused within our licensed field and so have agreed to inform Intuitive before commencing any further outside clinical\ninvestigations for endoluminal applications or engaging in external technology exhibitions at non-intravascular conferences. There can be no assurance that Intuitive will not challenge any activities we engage in outside the intravascular space, and we cannot assure you that in the event of such a challenge we would be able to reach agreement with Intuitive on whether activities outside our licensed field may be conducted without the use of the Intuitive\u2019s intellectual property. If Intuitive asserts that any of our activities outside the licensed field are infringing their patent or other intellectual property rights or commences litigation against us, we will incur significant costs defending against such claims or seeking an additional license from Intuitive, and we may be required to limit use of our systems or future products and technologies within our licensed intravascular field if any of our activities outside the licensed field are judged to infringe Intuitive\u2019s intellectual property, any of which could cause substantial harm our business, operations and financial condition. Although Intuitive is restricted in how it can terminate our license, if Intuitive were ever to successfully do so, and if we are unable to obtain another license from Intuitive, we could be required to abandon use of our existing product technology completely and could have to undergo a substantial redesign and design-around effort, which we cannot assure you would be successful. In October 2012, we signed an updated license agreement with Intuitive. Under the terms of the agreement, Intuitive\u2019s existing co-exclusive rights to our patent portfolio to certain non-vascular procedures have been extended to include patents filed or conceived by us subsequent to the original 2005 agreement up to and including the period three years subsequent to the amendment. We retain the right to use our intellectual property for all clinical applications, both vascular and non-vascular.\nThe medical device industry is characterized by patent litigation and we could become subject to litigation that could be costly, result in the diversion of management\u2019s attention, require us to pay damages and discontinue selling our products.\nThe medical device industry is characterized by frequent and extensive litigation and administrative proceedings over patent and other intellectual property rights. Whether a product infringes a patent involves complex legal and factual issues, the determination of which is often difficult to predict, and the outcome may be uncertain until the relevant court has entered final non-appealable. Our competitors may assert, and have asserted in the past, that our products or the use of our products are covered by United States or foreign patents held by them. This risk is heightened due to the numerous issued and pending patents relating to the use of robotic and catheter-based procedures in the medical technology field. For example, we have received correspondence from a third party indicating it believes it holds a patent that our Sensei system may infringe. While we do not believe that the Sensei system infringes this patent, there can be no assurance that the third party will not take further action, such as filing a patent infringement lawsuit, including a request for injunctive relief, to bar the manufacture and sale of our Sensei system in the United States.\nIf relevant patents are upheld as valid and enforceable and we are found to infringe, we could be prevented from selling our system unless we can obtain a license to use technology or ideas covered by such patent or are able to redesign our products to avoid infringement. A license may not be available at all or on commercially reasonable terms, and we may not be able to redesign our products to avoid infringement. Modification of our products or development of new products could require us to conduct additional clinical trials and to revise our filings with the FDA and other regulatory bodies, which would be time-consuming and expensive. If we are not successful in obtaining a license or redesigning our products, we may be unable to sell our products and our business could suffer. In addition, our patents may be subject to various invalidity attacks, such as those based upon earlier filed patent applications, patents, publications, products or processes, which might invalidate or limit the scope of the protection that our patents afford.\nInfringement actions, validity challenges and other intellectual property claims and proceedings, whether with or without merit, may cause us to incur substantial costs and could place a significant strain on our financial resources, divert the attention of management from our business and harm our reputation. We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, substantial costs in obtaining patents and expect to incur substantial costs defending our proprietary rights. Incurring such costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nWe cannot be certain that we will successfully defend our patents from infringement or claims of invalidity or unenforceability, or that we will successfully defend against allegations of infringement of third-party patents. In addition, any public announcements related to litigation or administrative proceedings initiated or threatened by us, or initiated or threatened against us, could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe may be subject to damages resulting from claims that our employees or we have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nMany of our employees were previously employed at universities or other medical device companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. We could in the future be subject to claims that these employees, or we, have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending against such claims, a court could order us to pay substantial damages and prohibit us from using technologies or features that are essential to our products, if such technologies or features are found to incorporate or be derived from the trade secrets or other proprietary information of the former employers. An inability to incorporate technologies or features that are important or essential to our products would have a material adverse effect on our business, and may prevent us from selling our products. In addition, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. A loss of key research personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to commercialize certain potential products, which could severely harm our business. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, such litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management. Incurring such costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nAdditional Risks Related to Regulatory Matters\nIf we fail to obtain regulatory clearances in other countries for existing products or products under development, we will not be able to commercialize these products in those countries.\nIn order to market our products outside of the United States, we must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding quality, safety and efficacy of our products. Approval and CE marking procedures vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval or CE Certificate of Conformity in other countries might differ from that required to obtain FDA clearance. The regulatory approval or CE marking process in other countries may include all of the risks detailed above regarding FDA clearance in the United States. Regulatory approval or the CE marking of a product in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval or a CE Certificate of Conformity in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. Failure to obtain regulatory approval or a CE Certificate of Conformity in other countries or any delay or setback in obtaining such approval could have the same adverse effects described above regarding FDA clearance in the United States.\nFor example, in the EEA, our devices are required to comply with the Essential Requirements laid down in Annex I to the Medical Devices Directive (applicable in the non-EU EEA Member States via the Agreement on the European Economic Area). We are also required to ensure compliance with the relevant quality system requirements laid down in the Annexes to the Medical Devices Directive. Companies compliant with ISO requirements such as \u201cEN ISO 13485: 2003 Medical devices - Quality management systems - Requirements for regulatory purposes\u201d benefit from a presumption of conformity with the relevant Essential Requirements or the quality system requirements laid down in the Annexes to the Medical Devices Directive. Following successful completion of a conformity assessment procedure conducted in relation to the medical device and its manufacturer and their conformity with the Essential Requirements and quality system requirements, the Notified Body issues a CE Certificate of Conformity. This Certificate entitles the manufacturer to affix the CE mark to its medical devices after having prepared and signed a related EC Declaration of Conformity. We received a CE Certificate of Conformity for our Artisan catheters in May 2007, our Magellan Robotic System in July 2011, our Magellan Robotic Catheter and related accessories designed for use with the Magellan Robotic System in October 2011, our Artisan Extend catheters\nin February 2013, and our Magellan Robotic 6Fr catheters in November 2014. We cannot be certain that we will be successful in meeting and continuing to meet the requirements of the Medical Devices Directive in the EEA.\nWe may fail to comply with continuing postmarket regulatory requirements of the FDA and other authorities and become subject to substantial penalties, or marketing experience may show that our device is unsafe, forcing us to recall or withdraw it permanently from the market.\nWe must comply with continuing regulation by the FDA and other authorities, including the FDA\u2019s QSR, requirements, labeling and promotional requirements and medical device adverse event and other reporting requirements. If the adverse event reports we file with the FDA regarding death, serious injuries or malfunctions indicate or suggest that the device presents an unacceptable risk to patients, including when used off-label by physicians, we may be forced to recall the device and/or modify the device or its labeling, or withdraw it permanently from the market. The FDA has expressed concerns regarding the safety of the Sensei system when used with catheters and in procedures not specified in the current label, such as ablation catheters and ablation procedures, and we have already filed Medical Device Reports reporting adverse events during procedures utilizing our technology. Physicians may be using our device off-label with ablation catheters in ablation procedures, as well as in other EP procedures for which we have not collected safety data, and we therefore cannot assure you that clinical experience will demonstrate that the device is safe for these uses.\nAny failure to comply, or any perception that we are not complying, with continuing regulation by the FDA or other authorities, including restrictions regarding off-label promotion, could result in enforcement action that may include suspension or withdrawal of regulatory clearances approvals, or CE Certificates of Conformity, recalling products, ceasing product marketing, seizure and detention of products, paying significant fines and penalties, criminal prosecution and similar actions that could limit product sales, delay product shipment and harm our profitability and reputation.\nIn many foreign countries in which we market our products, we are subject to regulations affecting, among other things, product standards, packaging requirements, labeling requirements, import restrictions, tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements. Many of these regulations are similar to those of the FDA. In addition, in many countries the national health or social security organizations require our products to be qualified before procedures performed using our products become eligible for coverage and reimbursement. Failure to receive, or delays in the receipt of, relevant foreign qualifications could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory clearances and CE Certificates of Conformity, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.\nIf we or our contract manufacturers fail to comply with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulations, California Department of Health Services requirements or EEA quality system requirements, our manufacturing operations could be interrupted and our product sales and operating results could suffer.\nOur manufacturing processes, and those of some of our contract manufacturers, are required to comply with the FDA\u2019s QSR, which cover the procedures and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage and shipping of our devices. The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic inspections of manufacturing facilities. We and our contract manufacturers are subject to such inspections. Similar quality system requirements also apply in the EEA. If our manufacturing facilities or those of any of our contract manufacturers fail to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse quality system inspection, the FDA, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Notified Body, the competent authorities in the EEA could take enforcement action, including any of the following administration or judicial sanctions, which could have a material impact on our operations:\n\u2022\nuntitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;\n\u2022\nunanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions;\n\u2022\ncustomer notifications or mandatory plans product for repair, product replacement, or refunds;\n\u2022\nrecall, detention or seizure of our products;\n\u2022\noperating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n\u2022\nrefusing or delaying our requests for submissions seeking 510(k) clearance, investigational device exemptions (IDE) to perform clinical studies or premarket approval of new products or modified products;\n\u2022\noperating restrictions;\n\u2022\nwithdrawing 510(k) clearances or IDE/PMA approvals that have already been granted;\n\u2022\nsuspension or withdrawal of our CE Certificates of Conformity;\n\u2022\nrefusal to grant export approval or issue export documentation for our products;\n\u2022\nimport holds; or\n\u2022\ncriminal prosecution.\nWe underwent an FDA inspection, which employed the Quality System Inspection Technique, or QSIT, in 2014 and received one inspectional observation. We received the establishment inspection report (EIR) from the FDA on January 26, 2015 after the agency closed the inspection per CFT 20.64.We are subject to the licensing requirements of the California Department of Health Services, or CDHS. We have been inspected and licensed by the CDHS and remain subject to re-inspection at any time. Failure to maintain a license from the CDHS or to meet the inspection criteria of the CDHS would disrupt our manufacturing processes. If an inspection by the CDHS indicates that there are deficiencies in our manufacturing process, we could be required to take remedial actions at potentially significant expense, and our facility may be temporarily or permanently closed.\nIf our products cause or contribute to a death or a serious injury, or malfunction in certain ways, we will be subject to medical device reporting regulations, which can result in voluntary corrective actions or agency enforcement actions. An increased frequency of filing Medical Device Reports, or MDRs, or Manufacturers\u2019 Incident Reports in the EEA concerning adverse events occurring during procedures performed with our technology could result in increased regulatory scrutiny of our products and could delay or prevent the adoption of our products.\nUnder the FDA\u2019s medical device reporting regulations, medical device manufacturers are required to report to the FDA when the manufacturer becomes aware of information from any source that alleges that a device marketed by the manufacturer has or may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or one of our similar devices were to recur. A manufacturer may determine that an event may not meet the FDA\u2019s reporting criteria so that an MDR is not necessary. However, the FDA can review a manufacturer\u2019s decision and may disagree. We have made decisions that certain types of events are not MDR reportable. In the EEA, similar reporting requirements are imposed on medical device manufacturers. When a medical device, its labeling or instructions for use are is suspected to be a contributory cause of an event that led or might have led to death of or the serious deterioration of the health of a patient, or user or of other person, its manufacturer or authorized representative must report the event to the competent authority of the EEA country where the incident occurred. There can be no assurance that the FDA or the competent authorities in the EEA country will agree with our decisions. If we fail to report MDRs to the FDA within the required timeframes, or at all, or if the FDA or the competent authorities of the EEA countries disagree with any of our determinations that events are not reportable, the FDA or the competent authorities of the EEA countries could take enforcement action against us. Any such adverse event involving our products also could result in future voluntary corrective actions, such as products withdrawals and recalls or customer notifications, or agency action, such as inspection or enforcement action. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, as well as defending ourselves in a lawsuit, will require the dedication of our time and capital, distract management from operating our business, and may harm our reputation and financial results.\nWe have filed MDRs, and Manufacturer\u2019s Incident Reports reporting adverse events during procedures utilizing our technology and have developed internal systems and processes that are designed to evaluate future events that may require adverse event reporting to the FDA or the competent authorities if the EEA countries. As the frequency of use of our technology in EP and vascular procedures increases, we are experiencing, and anticipate continuing to experience, it being necessary to file an increased number of MDRs and Manufacturer\u2019s Incident Reports. An increased frequency of filing MDRs and Manufacturer\u2019s Incident Reports or a failure to timely file MDRs may result in requests for further information from the FDA or the competent authorities of the EEA countries, which could delay other matters that we may have pending before the FDA, the competent authorities of the EEA or our Notified Body or result in additional regulatory action. An increased frequency of MDRs and Manufacturer\u2019s Incident Reports could also reduce confidence in the safety of our products and delay or prevent the acceptance of our products by physicians and hospitals, which would harm our business and cause our stock price to decline.\nOur products may in the future be subject to product recalls that could harm our reputation, business and financial results. As a manufacturer we are sometimes required to make decisions about whether to take corrective action in the field and whether to report that activity to the FDA or the competent authorities of the EEA countries. If the FDA or the competent authorities of the EEA countries disagrees with those decisions, we may be subject to enforcement action and our product sales and operating results could suffer.\nThe FDA and similar foreign competent authorities have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. In the case of the FDA, the authority to require a recall must be based on an FDA finding that there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious injury or death. In addition, foreign competent authorities have the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design, manufacture or performance of the products and inadequacy in the labeling or Instruction for Use. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us or one of our distributors could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues. We have conducted voluntary recalls in the past. Recalls of any of our products would likely divert managerial and financial resources and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe FDA requires that certain classifications of recalls be reported to the FDA within 10 working days after the recall is initiated. Companies are required to maintain certain records of recalls, even if they are not reportable to the FDA or other competent authorities. We have in the past initiated voluntary actions involving our products that we determined did not require notification of the FDA, and we may in the future initiate additional voluntary actions that we determine do not require notification of the FDA. If the FDA or the competent authorities of the EEA countries disagree with our determinations, they could require us to report those actions as recalls. Additionally, we have, and may again in the future, take actions in the field that we do not consider to be recalls. If the FDA or other competent authorities disagree with our determinations, they could require us to treat these actions as recalls, issue communications, or report those actions to FDA. The agency may also initiate other enforcement action if they disagree with our recall decisions, including but not limited to issuing warning letters, or more serious actions such as civil or criminal penalties. A future recall announcement or enforcement action could harm our reputation with customers and negatively affect our sales. In addition, the FDA or other competent authorities could take enforcement action for failing to treat certain actions as recalls and report the recalls when they were conducted.\nModifications to our products may, and in some instances, will, require new regulatory clearances, approvals or CE Certificates of Conformity and may require us to recall or cease marketing our products until clearances, approvals or CE Certificates of Conformity are obtained.\nModifications to our products may require new regulatory approvals or clearances, including 510(k) clearances or PMAs, and may require us to recall or cease marketing the modified devices until these clearances\nor approvals are obtained. The FDA requires device manufacturers to initially make and document a determination of whether or not modifications require a new approval, supplement or clearance. A manufacturer of a 510(k) cleared product is required to obtain 510(k) clearance for device modifications that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, or constitute a major change in the intended use of the subject device. Accordingly, a manufacturer may determine that a modification could not significantly affect safety or efficacy and does not represent a major change in its intended use so that no new 510(k) clearance is necessary. However, the FDA can review a manufacturer\u2019s decision and may disagree. The FDA may also on its own initiative determine that a new clearance or approval is required.\nFor those products sold in the EEA, we must notify and await completion of the review of our Notified Body, before introducing substantial changes to the products or to our quality system. Following its review, our Notified Body will decide whether our existing CE Certificates of Conformity can be maintained or varied, or whether new certificate are required.\nWe have made modifications to our products in the past and may make additional modifications in the future that we believe do not or will not require additional review, clearances or approvals. There can be no assurance that the FDA, our Notified Body or the competent authorities of the EEA countries will agree with our approach in such matters or that, if required, subsequent requests for 510(k) clearance, PMA approval or CE Certificates of Conformity will be received in a timely fashion, if at all. The FDA, our Notified Body or the competent authorities of the EEA countries may require us to cease supply, recall and to stop marketing our products as modified or to disable features pending clearance or approval or the granting of a CE Certificate of Conformity which would significantly harm our ability to sell our products and cause harm to our existing customer relationships and business. Even if we are not required to take such action, delays in obtaining clearances, approvals or CE Certificate of Conformity for features would adversely affect our ability to introduce enhanced products in a timely manner and would harm our revenue and operating results. The FDA our Notified Body or the competent authorities of the EEA countries could also take other enforcement action, including but not limited to, issuing a warning letter relating to our decision to implement features and other product modifications without submission of a new 510(k) notice or PMA and suspension or withdrawal of our existing CE Certificates of Conformity.\nClinical trials and clinical investigations necessary to support any future 510(k), PMA application or CE marking of our products will be expensive and may require the enrollment of large numbers of clinical sites and patients, and suitable patients may be difficult to identify and recruit. Delays or failures in our clinical trials may prevent us from commercializing any modified or new products and will adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects.\nInitiating and completing clinical trials and clinical investigations necessary to support a 510(k), PMA application or CE marking for expanded indications for use of our existing products, will be time consuming and expensive and the outcome uncertain. Moreover, the results of early clinical trials and clinical investigations are not necessarily predictive of future results, and any product we advance into clinical trials may not have favorable results in later clinical trials.\nConducting successful clinical studies and clinical investigations may require the enrollment of large numbers of clinical sites and patients, and suitable patients may be difficult to identify and recruit. Patient enrollment in clinical trials/investigations and completion of patient participation and follow-up depends on many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the clinical trial/investigation protocol, the attractiveness of, or the discomforts and risks associated with, the treatments received by enrolled subjects, the availability of appropriate clinical trial/study investigators, support staff, and proximity of patients to clinical sites and ability to comply with the eligibility and exclusion criteria for participation in the clinical trial/investigation and patient compliance. For example, patients may be discouraged from enrolling in our clinical trials/investigations if the protocol requires them to undergo extensive post-treatment procedures or follow-up to assess the safety and effectiveness of our products or if they determine that the treatments received under the\nprotocols are not attractive or involve unacceptable risks or discomforts. Patients may also not participate in our clinical trials/investigations if they choose to participate in contemporaneous clinical trials/investigations of competitive products or they can obtain the treatment without participating in our trial/investigation through physicians who use the product off-label. We received approval of an IDE application for an approximately 300 patient study for the treatment of atrial fibrillation and enrolled our first patient in May 2010 and approximately 50 patients were enrolled as of January 2013. A proposed modification to the study protocol was submitted to FDA for review in April 2013. The modified study, which plans to enroll as few as 125 subjects, was approved by the FDA in August 2013 and approximately three-fourths of the targeted number of additional subjects have been enrolled to date. The study includes a seven-day follow-up for safety and a one-year follow-up for efficacy at intervals of 90, 180, and 365 days. Development of sufficient and appropriate clinical protocols to demonstrate quality, safety and efficacy may be required and we may not adequately develop such protocols to support clearance or approval. Delays in patient enrollment or failure of patients to consent or continue to participate in a clinical trial/investigation may cause an increase in costs and delays in the approval and attempted commercialization of our products or result in the failure of the clinical trial/investigation. In addition, despite considerable time and expense invested in our clinical trials, FDA, our Notified Body or the competent authorities of the EEA countries may not consider our data adequate to demonstrate quality, safety and efficacy. Such increased costs and delays or failures could adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects.\nIf we fail to comply with healthcare laws and regulations, we could face substantial penalties and our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur activities, and the activities of our agents, including some contracted third parties, are subject to extensive government regulation and oversight both in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions. Our interactions in the U.S. or abroad with physicians and other potential referral sources who prescribe or purchase our products are subject to government regulation designed to prevent health care fraud and abuse. Relevant U.S. laws include:\n\u2022\nthe federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any item or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, by federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u2022\nfederal civil False Claims Act which prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment of government funds that are false or fraudulent;\n\u2022\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which prohibits, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters and which also imposes certain obligations relating to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u2022\nthe federal Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1997, which makes it illegal to offer or provide money or anything of value to officials of foreign governments, foreign political parties, or international organizations with the intent to obtain or retain business or seek a business advantage; and\n\u2022\nstate law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, state breach notification laws, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians. Some states, such as California, Massachusetts and Nevada, mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs and/or impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians.\nThe FDA, the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services or OIG, the U.S. Department of Justice, states\u2019 Attorneys General and other governmental authorities actively enforce the laws and regulations discussed above. In the U.S., pharmaceutical and device manufacturers have been the target of numerous government prosecutions and investigations alleging violations of law, including claims asserting impermissible off-label promotion of pharmaceutical and medical device products, payments intended to influence the referral of federal or state health care business, and submission of false or fraudulent claims for government payments. The Affordable Care Act also clarified that a person or entity need not have actual knowledge of the Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent in order to violate it. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act or federal civil money penalties statute. As part of our compliance program, we have reviewed our sales contracts and marketing materials and practices to assure compliance with these federal and state laws, and inform employees and marketing representatives of the Anti-Kickback Statute and their obligations thereunder. Although compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. We cannot rule out the possibility that the government or other third parties could interpret these laws differently and challenge our practices under one or more of these laws.\nThe Affordable Care Act also imposes new tracking and disclosure requirements on device manufacturers for any \u201ctransfer of value\u201d made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals. Device manufacturers with products for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program were required to begin tracking such payments on August 1, 2013 and submit reports to Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS by March 31, 2014, and by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year. We began tracking applicable payments and transfers of value on August 1, 2013 and began reporting payment data to the CMS in March 2014 and will continue to do so annually thereafter.\nIf our past or present operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion of our products from reimbursement under federal healthcare programs like Medicare and Medicaid and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. The risk of our being found in violation of these laws or regulations is increased by the fact that many of these laws or regulations have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Any action against us for violation of these laws or regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. Moreover, to achieve compliance with applicable federal and state privacy, security, and electronic transaction laws, we may be required to modify our operations with respect to the handling of patient information. Implementing these modifications may prove costly. At this time, we are not able to determine the full consequences to us, including the total cost of compliance, of these various federal and state laws.\nOur international operations expose us to liability under global anticorruption laws.\nWe are also subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials and/or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Because of the predominance of government-sponsored healthcare systems around the world, many of our customer relationships outside of the United States involve governmental entities and are therefore subject to such anti-bribery laws. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. Despite our training and compliance programs, our internal control policies and procedures may not protect us from negligent, reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. Moreover, even a perceived or alleged violation could result in costly investigations or proceedings that could harm our financial position and reputation.\nThe application of state certificate of need regulations and compliance by providers with federal and state licensing requirements, as well as accreditation requirements, could substantially limit our ability to sell our products and grow our business.\nSome states require healthcare providers to obtain a certificate of need or similar regulatory approval prior to the acquisition of high-cost capital items such as our Sensei and Magellan systems. In many cases, a limited number of these certificates are available and, as a result, hospitals and other healthcare providers may be unable to obtain a certificate of need for the purchase of our Sensei and Magellan systems. Further, our sales cycle for our system is typically longer in certificate of need states due to the time it takes our customers to obtain the required approvals. In addition, our customers must meet various federal and state regulatory and/or accreditation requirements in order to receive reimbursement from government-sponsored healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and other third-party payors. Any lapse by our customers in maintaining appropriate licensure, certification or accreditation, or the failure of our customers to satisfy the other necessary requirements under government-sponsored healthcare programs, could cause our sales to decline.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe trading price of our common stock has been volatile and is likely to be volatile in the future.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile. Further, our common stock has a limited trading history. Since our initial public offering in November 2006 through February 27, 2015, our closing stock price has fluctuated from a low of $0.55 to a high of $38.87. The market price for our common stock may be affected by a number of factors, including those set forth in this Item 1A as well as:\n\u2022\nthe announcement of our operating results, including the number of systems sold during a period and our revenue for the period, and the comparison of these results to the expectations of analysts and investors;\n\u2022\nthe receipt, denial or timing of regulatory clearances, approvals or actions of our products or competing products;\n\u2022\nsales of common stock or other debt or equity securities by us or our stockholders in the future;\n\u2022\nthe success of any collaborations we may undertake with other companies;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop, introduce and market new or enhanced versions of our products on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key scientific or management personnel;\n\u2022\nthe pace of enrollment or results of our currently planned clinical trial of at least 125 patients or any other clinical trials;\n\u2022\nchanges in policies affecting third-party coverage and reimbursement in the United States and other countries;\n\u2022\nability of our products to achieve market success;\n\u2022\nthe performance of third-party contract manufacturers and component suppliers;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop sales and marketing capabilities;\n\u2022\nour ability to manufacture our products to meet commercial and regulatory standards;\n\u2022\nour ability to manage costs and improve margins;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated volatility in our results of operations or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements of new products, technological innovations or product advancements by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements of acquisitions or dispositions by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\ndevelopments with respect to patents and other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\ndisputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u2022\ntrading volume of our common stock;\n\u2022\nour announcements of guidance regarding future operating or financial results which fails to meet investor or analyst expectations or which differs from our previously-announced guidance;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts, failure to obtain analyst coverage of our common stock or our failure to achieve analyst earnings estimates;\n\u2022\npublic statements by analysts or clinicians regarding their perceptions of the effectiveness of our products;\n\u2022\ndevelopments in our industry;\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions and other factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors; and\n\u2022\nthe impact of shareholder lawsuits and governmental investigations both on us and on our public perception.\nThe stock prices of many companies in the medical device industry have experienced wide fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. Following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, stockholders have often instituted class action securities litigation against those companies. Additional class action securities litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management resources, which could significantly harm our business.\nSecurities analysts may not continue, or additional securities analysts may not initiate, coverage for our common stock or may issue negative reports, and this may have a negative impact on the market price of our common stock.\nCurrently, several securities analysts provide research coverage of our common stock. Several analysts have already published statements that do not portray our technology, products or procedures using our products in a positive light and others may do so in the future. If we are unable to educate those who publicize such reports about the benefits we believe our technology provides, or if one or more of the analysts who elects to cover us downgrades our stock, our stock price would likely decline rapidly. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline. The trading market for our common stock may be affected in part by the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. If sufficient securities analysts do not cover our common stock, the lack of research coverage may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. It may be difficult for companies such as ours, with smaller market capitalizations, to attract and maintain sufficient independent financial analysts that will cover our common stock. This could have a negative effect on the market price of our stock.\nOur principal stockholders, directors and management own a large percentage of our voting stock, which allows them to exercise significant influence over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nBased on our review of publicly available filings as of February 27, 2015, all those known by the Company to be beneficial owners of more than five percent of our common stock, together with our executive officers and directors beneficially own or control approximately 36.7 percent of our outstanding common stock. Additionally, on March 11, 2015,we issued to investors 53,846 shares of preferred stock which are convertible into shares of common stock and warrants which are exercisable for 53,846,000 shares of common stock (see Note 15). Upon receipt of shareholder approval the preferred stock will convert into the number of shares of common stock obtained by dividing (i) $650 plus the amount of any accrued and unpaid dividends by (ii) the lesser of $0.65 or the per share trailing weighted average share price of the common stock on NASDAQ for the ten trading days\nending on the day prior to the conversion. Assuming the conversion ratio of 1,300 shares of common stock for each share of preferred stock (which equates to a trailing weighted average share price of $0.50 per share), the exercise in full of the warrants issued in connection with the financing, as well as the exercise in full of all outstanding warrants held by these stockholders, the ownership and control by these stockholders may increase to up to 67.45% of our outstanding common stock. Accordingly, our principal stockholders and our executive officers and directors have substantial influence over the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets or any other significant corporate transaction. These stockholders may also delay or prevent a change of control or otherwise discourage a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us, even if such a change of control would benefit our other stockholders. This significant concentration of stock ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock due to investors\u2019 perception that conflicts of interest may exist or arise.\nWe have not paid dividends in the past and do not expect to pay dividends in the future, and any return on investment may be limited to the value of our common stock.\nWe have never paid dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends on our common stock will depend on our earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting us at such time as our Board of Directors may consider relevant. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because a return on your investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates. In addition, pursuant to our loan agreement, we must obtain the lenders\u2019 prior written consent in order to pay any dividends on our common stock.\nSome provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders. These provisions:\n\u2022\npermit our Board of Directors to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, with any rights, preferences and privileges as they may designate, including the right to approve an acquisition or other change in our control;\n\u2022\nprovide that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the Board of Directors;\n\u2022\nprovide that all vacancies, including newly created directorships, may, except as otherwise required by law, be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum;\n\u2022\ndivide our Board of Directors into three classes;\n\u2022\nrequire that any action to be taken by our stockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and not be taken by written consent;\n\u2022\nprovide that stockholders seeking to present proposals before a meeting of stockholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at a meeting of stockholders must provide notice in writing in a timely manner, and also specify requirements as to the form and content of a stockholder\u2019s notice;\n\u2022\ndo not provide for cumulative voting rights, therefore allowing the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock entitled to vote in any election of directors to elect all of the directors standing for election, if they should so choose;\n\u2022\nprovide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the Board, our chief executive officer or by the Board of Directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of authorized directors; and\n\u2022\nprovide that stockholders will be permitted to amend our amended and restated bylaws only upon receiving at least 66 2/3 percent of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of all outstanding shares then entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.\nIn addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any broad range of business combinations with any stockholder who owns, or at any time in the last three years owned, 15 percent or more of our outstanding voting stock for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an interested stockholder. This provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders.\nFuture sales or issuances of shares of our common stock, the announcement to undertake such sales or issuances, or the perception that such sales or issuances may occur, may dilute our existing stockholders and depress the market price of our common stock.\nSales of our common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for our common stock by us or by our stockholders, announcements of the proposed sales of our common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for our common stock or the perception that sales may be made, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. We may issue additional shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for our common stock in follow-on offerings to raise additional capital or in connection with acquisitions, corporate alliances or settlements with third parties and we plan to issue additional shares to our employees, directors or consultants in connection with their services to us. For example, in August 2013 we sold 28,455,284 shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 34,146,339 shares of our common stock in a private placement and in August 2014, we issued additional warrants to purchase an aggregate of 6,286,023 shares of our common stock in a subsequent private placement. The issuance of the shares of common stock resulted in immediate dilution to our stockholders and the on-going exercises of outstanding warrants has caused, and may continue to cause, further dilution to our stockholders in the future.\nOur financial results may vary significantly from period to period, which may reduce our stock price.\nOur financial results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control, which may cause the market price of our common stock to fall. For these reasons, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. Our financial results may be negatively affected by any of the risk factors listed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nWe incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and the Nasdaq Global Market, have imposed various new requirements on public companies, including requiring establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these requirements. Moreover, these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly.", "PERMNO": 91613, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "HNSN"}
