{"cik": "1305323", "company": "Bridgepoint Education Inc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-08", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nInvesting in our common stock involves risk. Before making an investment in our common stock, you should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below, as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our annual consolidated financial statements and the information set forth in Item 1, \u201cBusiness\u201d and Item 7, \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d The risks described below are those which we believe are the material risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may impact our business operations. Any of the risks described below could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. In these circumstances, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Material Weaknesses In Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If our remedial measures are insufficient to address these material weaknesses, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to further restate our financial results, which could adversely affect our stock price and result in our inability to maintain compliance with applicable stock exchange listing requirements.\nWe concluded that there were material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, as we did not maintain effective controls over the accounting for revenue recognition. Specifically, we did not maintain effective controls surrounding the selection and application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d) related to revenue recognition. We also did not maintain effective controls to assess the reliability of system generated data used in the operation of certain revenue recognition controls. These control deficiencies did not result in a material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 or any of the quarters in fiscal year 2015. However, these control deficiencies could result in misstatements of revenue, bad debt expense, accounts receivable, deferred revenue and the related financial disclosures that would result in a material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis. Accordingly, our management has determined that these control deficiencies constitute material weaknesses.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis. Management evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 and concluded that each was ineffective as of December 31, 2015. This Annual Report on Form 10-K reflects management's conclusion regarding the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015. See Item 9A, \u201cControls and Procedures.\u201d The existence of this issue could adversely affect us, our reputation and investors' perception of us.\nWe plan to implement measures to remediate the underlying causes of the control deficiencies that gave rise to the material weaknesses. These measures include the hiring of new accounting personnel, as well as providing additional training for existing personnel. These measures also include the implementation of financial reporting risk assessments and review processes to ensure the related significant accounting policies are implemented and applied properly under GAAP on a consistent basis through the Company. We plan to perform a review of all key reports utilized in the revenue and receivable cycle to ensure appropriate controls are in place over the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in these key reports. We have also established enhanced procedures to ensure appropriate review of accounting policies by the members of our management team with the requisite level of accounting knowledge, experience and training.\nHowever, we have not completed all of the corrective processes and procedures and the related evaluation or remediation that we believe are necessary. As we continue to evaluate and work to remediate the material weaknesses, we may determine to implement additional measures to address the underlying control deficiencies. The actions we are taking to remediate the material weaknesses are subject to ongoing senior management review, as well as oversight by the audit committee of our board of directors.\nIf our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weaknesses, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to further restate our financial results, which could adversely affect our stock price and result in our inability to maintain compliance with applicable stock exchange listing requirements.\nRisks Related to the Extensive Regulation of Our Business\nIf our institutions fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, they could face monetary liabilities or penalties, operational restrictions, or loss of access to Title IV programs from which we derive most of our revenue.\nIn the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, Ashford University derived 80.9%, 83.4% and 85.6%, respectively, and University of the Rockies derived 86.6%, 88.3% and 87.6%, respectively, of their revenues (in each case calculated in accordance with applicable regulations of the Department) from Title IV programs. If our institutions were to lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or were to have such participation substantially curtailed, enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nTo participate in Title IV programs, an institution must be (i) legally authorized to operate in the state in which it is physically located, (ii) accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the Department as a reliable indicator of educational quality and (iii) certified as an eligible institution by the Department. As a result, we are subject to extensive regulation by state education agencies, our institutions' accrediting agencies and the Department. These regulatory requirements cover many aspects of our operations. They also restrict our ability to acquire or open new schools, add new or expand existing educational programs, change our corporate structure or ownership, and make other substantive changes. If one of our institutions fails to comply with these regulatory requirements, the Department could impose sanctions on that institution, depending on the nature of the noncompliance. For additional information, see \u201cRegulation - Department Regulation of Title IV Programs - Potential effect of noncompliance with Title IV regulations\u201d in Item 1, \"Business.\"\nGiven that state education agencies, the Department and our institutions' accrediting agencies, WSCUC and HLC, periodically revise their requirements and modify their interpretations of existing requirements, we cannot reliably predict how these regulatory requirements will be applied or whether we will be able to comply with all of the requirements.\nThe Department's Office of Inspector General conducted a compliance audit of Ashford University and issued a final audit report that contains findings of noncompliance and recommendations for certain administrative remedies.\nOn January 21, 2011, Ashford University received a final audit report from the OIG, regarding the compliance audit commenced in May 2008 and covering the period July 1, 2006 through June 30, 2007. The audit covered Ashford University's administration of Title IV program funds, including compliance with regulations governing institutional and student eligibility, awards and disbursements of Title IV program funds, verification of awards and returns of unearned funds during that period, and its compensation of financial aid and recruiting personnel during the period May 10, 2005 through June 30, 2009.\nThe final audit report contained audit findings for the 2006-2007 award year and related recommendations to the FSA. For additional information regarding the OIG's final audit report and the findings and recommendations contained therein, see \u201cRegulation - Department Regulation of Title IV Programs - Compliance reviews, audits and reports\u201d in Item 1, \"Business.\" If the FSA were to determine to assess a monetary liability or commence an action to limit, suspend or terminate the university's participation in Title IV programs, Ashford University would have an opportunity to contest the assessment or proposed action through a series of administrative proceedings, with the right to seek review of any final administrative action in the federal courts. Although we believe Ashford University operates in substantial compliance with Department regulations that are applicable to the areas under review, we cannot predict the ultimate extent of the potential liability or remedial actions, if any, that might result from the OIG recommendations in the final audit report. Such findings and the related potential liability or remedial action could have a material adverse effect on our reputation in the industry, our ability to recruit students and our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur institutions' failure to maintain accreditation would denigrate the value of our institutions\u2019 educational programs and result in a loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.\nAn institution must be accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the Department to participate in Title IV programs. Ashford University is accredited by WSCUC and University of the Rockies is accredited by HLC. Each of WSCUC and HLC is recognized by the Department as a reliable authority regarding the quality of education and training provided by the institutions it accredits. To remain accredited, our institutions must continuously meet accreditation standards relating to, among other things, performance, governance, institutional integrity, educational quality, faculty, administrative capability, resources and financial stability. If either of our institutions fails to satisfy any of the standards of its accrediting agency, it could lose its accreditation.\nIn February 2015, University of the Rockies received a letter from HLC stating that the Institutional Actions Council of HLC continued the accreditation of the university, with the next Reaffirmation of Accreditation in 2024-2025.\nAs part of a continuing monitoring process relating to WSCUC's grant of initial accreditation, Ashford University hosted a visiting team from WSCUC in a special visit in April 2015. In July 2015, Ashford University received an Action Letter from WSCUC outlining the findings arising out of its team's special visit. The Action Letter stated that the WSCUC visiting team found substantial evidence that Ashford University continues to make sustained progress in all six areas recommended by WSCUC in 2013. WSCUC also performs Mid-Cycle Reviews of its accredited institutions near the midpoint of their periods of accreditation, as required by the Department. The purpose of the Mid-Cycle Review is to identify problems with an institution\u2019s or program\u2019s continued compliance with agency standards while taking into account institutional or program strengths and stability. The Mid-Cycle Review report will focus particularly on student achievement, including indicators of educational effectiveness, retention and graduation data.\nLoss of accreditation by either of our institutions would denigrate the value of its educational programs and would result in its loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, which would have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nIn connection with its transition to WSCUC accreditation, Ashford University received approval from the BPPE to operate in California. As a result, the university will be subject to a greater reporting burden and could be subjected to increased regulatory or political scrutiny.\nTo be eligible to participate in Title IV programs, an institution must be legally authorized to offer its educational programs by the states in which it is physically located. Effective July 1, 2011, the Department established new requirements to determine if an institution is considered to be legally authorized by a state. For additional information, see \u201cRegulation - Department Regulation of Title IV Programs - State authorization\u201d in Item 1, \"Business.\" In connection with its transition to WSCUC accreditation, Ashford University designated its San Diego, California facilities as its main campus for Title IV purposes and submitted an Application for Approval to Operate an Accredited Institution to the BPPE on September 10, 2013.\nIn April 2014, Ashford University\u2019s application was granted and the university was approved by BPPE to operate in California until July 15, 2018. As a result, the university is no longer exempt from certain laws and regulations applicable to private, post-secondary educational institutions. These laws and regulations entail certain California reporting requirements, including but not limited to graduation, employment and licensing data, certain changes of ownership and control, faculty and programs, and student refund policies, as well as the triggering of other state and federal student employment data reporting and disclosure requirements. Compliance with the additional reporting and disclosure obligations arising under these laws and regulations could result in material additional costs and increased regulatory or political scrutiny of the university.\nAs a result of changes that have been made, or that may be required by the accreditors of our institutions, to our operational relationships with our institutions and to their operations and business models, our historical financial and business results may not necessarily be representative of future results.\nIn connection with the transition of Ashford University to WSCUC accreditation and our efforts to structure our operations to meet evolving regulatory expectations, our institutions have made operational changes and launched various new business initiatives, and additional changes may be required. These changes and initiatives included hiring new leadership, implementing smaller class sizes, requiring minimum age-levels for students, implementing the Ashford Promise (an initiative that allows students a full refund for all tuition and fees through the third week of a student's first class), hiring additional full-time faculty and implementing new program review models. Many of these changes and initiatives result in higher expense to the organization, primarily in the areas of instructional costs and services. In addition, we have made changes in our organizational structure and operational relationships with our academic institutions to ensure their academic independence and satisfaction of accreditation-related requirements. Some of these changes and initiatives have contributed to declines in new student enrollments. Accordingly, our historical results and trends, including enrollments, admissions advisory and marketing expenses, and instructional costs and services, may not be indicative of our future results, and there can be no assurance that changes to our operational relationship with our institutions or other changes we have made, or may make in the future, will not have an adverse impact on regulatory compliance, satisfaction of accreditation-related standards, or our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nThe Department is conducting a program review of Ashford University, which may result in the repayment of Title IV funds and may lead to fines, penalties, or other sanctions, and damage to the institution\u2019s reputation in the industry.\nThe Department periodically reviews institutions participating in Title IV programs for compliance with applicable laws and regulations. On July 31, 2014, the Department notified Ashford University that it intended to conduct a program review of Ashford University\u2019s administration of Title IV programs in which the university participates. The review commenced on August 25, 2014, and covers federal financial aid years 2012-2013 and 2013-2014, as well as compliance with the Clery Act, the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act and related regulations. The review may be expanded if deemed appropriate by the Department. Ashford University was provided with the Department's program review report and has responded to such\ninitial report. Following consideration of the university's response, the Department will issue a Final Program Review Determination letter. If the Final Program Review Determination letter were to include significant findings of non-compliance, Ashford University could be required, subject to administrative review procedures, to pay a fine or return Title IV funds previously received, or could be subjected to other administrative sanctions. While we cannot currently predict the final outcome of the Department reviews, any such adverse finding in the Final Program Review Determination letter could damage the institution\u2019s reputation in the industry and negatively impact enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nAdditional regulations or regulatory scrutiny resulting from action by the Department or other executive action could result in increased compliance costs, fines, sanctions or lawsuits, which could have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nThree negotiated rulemaking sessions held between January and March of 2014 resulted in draft regulations to enact changes to the Clery Act required by the enactment of the VAWA. The Department published final regulations in the Federal Register on October 20, 2014, which became effective on July 1, 2015. Among other things, VAWA requires institutions to compile statistics for additional incidents to those currently required by the Clery Act and include certain policies, procedures and programs pertaining to these incidents in annual security reports.\nThe Department held Program Integrity and Improvement negotiated rulemaking sessions between February and May of 2014 that focused on topics including, but not limited to, cash management of Title IV program funds, state authorization for programs offering distance or correspondence education, credit and clock hour conversions, the retaking of coursework, and the definition of \u201cadverse credit\u201d for PLUS loan borrowers. No consensus resulted from the rulemaking sessions. As a result, the Department had discretion to propose Program Integrity regulations in these areas. In August 2014, the Department published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing new regulations regarding the federal Direct PLUS loan program. The final regulations became effective on July 1, 2015 and update the standards for determining if a potential parent or student borrower has an adverse credit history for purposes of eligibility for a PLUS loan. Specifically, the regulations revise the definition of \u201cadverse credit history\u201d and require that parents and students who have an adverse credit history, but who are approved for a PLUS loan on the basis of extenuating circumstances or who obtain an endorser for the PLUS loan, must receive loan counseling before receiving the loan.\nOn September 3, 2014, the Department published a notice in the Federal Register to announce its intention to establish a negotiated rulemaking committee to prepare proposed regulations for the William D. Ford \u201cFederal Direct Loan Program\u201d authorized by the Higher Education Act. Two public hearings were held in October and November 2014. On December 19, 2014, the Department published a notice to announce its intention to establish the committee to (i) prepare proposed regulations to establish a new Pay as Your Earn repayment plan for those not covered by the existing Federal Direct Loan Program and (ii) establish procedures for FFEL Program loan holders to use to identify U.S. military service members who may be eligible for a lower interest rate on their FFEL Program loans. The committee met in February, March and April of 2015. On July 9, 2015, the Department published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing to amend the regulations governing the Federal Direct Loan Program, and on October 30, 2015, the regulations were amended to create a new income-contingent repayment plan in accordance with President Obama's initiative to allow more Federal Direct Loan Program borrowers to cap their loan payments at 10% of their monthly income. Changes were also made to the FFEL Program and Federal Direct Loan Program regulations to streamline and enhance existing processes and provide additional support to struggling borrowers. The amended regulations also expand the circumstances in which an institution may challenge or appeal a draft or final cohort default rate based on the institution's participation rate index.\nOn October 30, 2014, the Obama administration announced that the Department would lead an effort to formalize an interagency task force to conduct oversight of for-profit institutions of higher education, especially regarding alleged unfair, deceptive, and abusive policies and practices. The task force has been formed and includes the Departments of Justice, Treasury and Veterans Affairs, as well as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Federal Trade Commission, Securities and Exchange Commission, and state Attorneys General. The stated purpose of the task force is to \u201ccoordinate...activities and promote information sharing to protect students from unfair, deceptive and abusive policies and practices.\u201d\nOn March 24, 2015, the OIG issued a final audit report titled \u201cFederal Student Aid's Oversight of Schools' Compliance with the Incentive Compensation Ban.\u201d In its report, the OIG concluded that the FSA failed to (i) revise its enforcement procedures and guidance after the Department eliminated the incentive compensation safe harbors in 2010, (ii) develop procedures and guidance on appropriate enforcement action and (iii) properly resolve incentive compensation ban findings. In response to the report, the OIG and the FSA agreed on corrective action that may increase scrutiny and enforcement action related to payment of incentive compensation.\nOn May 18, 2015, the Department published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to amend cash management regulations related to Title IV program funds. The proposed regulations address student access to Title IV program funds, financial account fees and the opening of financial accounts. The proposed regulations also clarify how the Department treats previously passed coursework for Title IV eligibility purposes, and streamline the requirements for converting clock hours to credit hours.\nOn June 8, 2015, the Department held a press conference and released a document entitled \u201cFact Sheet: Protecting Students from Abusive Career Colleges\u201d in which the Department announced processes that will be established to assist students who may have been the victims of fraud in gaining relief under the \u201cdefense to repayment\u201d provisions of the Federal Direct Loan Program regulations. Rarely used in the past, the defense to repayment provisions allow a student to assert as a defense against repayment of federal Direct Loans any commission of fraud or other violation of applicable state law by the school related to such loans or the educational services paid for. The processes outlined by the Department on June 8 include (i) extending debt relief eligibility to groups of students where possible, (ii) providing loan forbearance and pausing payments while claims are being resolved, (iii) appointing a Special Master dedicated to borrower defense issues for students who believe they have a defense to repayment, (iv) establishing a streamlined process and (v) building a better system for debt relief for the future. The Department noted that building a better system for debt relief would involve developing new regulations to clarify and streamline loan forgiveness under the defense to repayment provisions, while maintaining or enhancing current consumer protection standards and strengthening provisions that hold schools accountable for actions that result in loan discharges.\nOn August 20, 2015, the Department announced its intention to establish a negotiated rulemaking committee to prepare proposed regulations for the Federal Student Aid programs authorized under Title IV of the Higher Education Act. The Department held two public hearings in September 2015 at which interested parties commented on the topics suggested by the Department and suggested additional topics that should be considered for action by the negotiating committee. The Department also accepted written comments and suggestions. The Department intends to convene a committee to develop proposed regulations for determining which acts or omissions of an institution of higher education a borrower may assert as a defense to repayment, and the consequences of the assertion of such borrower defenses for borrowers, institutions and the Department. Specifically, the Department intends to address (i) the procedures to be used for a borrower to establish a defense to repayment, (ii) the criteria the Department will use to identify acts or omissions of an institution that constitute defenses to repayment, (iii) the standards and procedures the Department will use to determine the liability of the institution for amounts based on borrower defenses and (iv) the effect of borrower defenses on institutional capability assessments. The committee met in January and February of 2016, and is scheduled to meet again in March 2016.\nWe cannot predict the scope and content of the regulations that may emerge from these or other rulemaking activities that the Department initiates or the consequences of increased executive regulatory scrutiny. The Company\u2019s compliance with these regulations or any additional regulations, or with modifications to existing regulations, could result in direct and indirect costs related to compliance, increased scrutiny, fines, liabilities, sanctions or lawsuits, which could have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nAny action by the U.S. Congress to revise the laws governing Title IV programs or to reduce funding for these programs could negatively impact our business.\nThe U.S. Congress must periodically reauthorize the Higher Education Act and annually determine the funding level for each Title IV program through the budget and appropriations process. In 2008, the Higher Education Act was reauthorized through September 2014, and the House Education and the Workforce Committee is currently working to reauthorize the Higher Education Act. The Higher Education Act's programs will continue year-to-year without explicit reauthorization as long as the U.S. Congress appropriates funds for the programs. The U.S. Congress may propose and pass revisions to the Higher Education Act between reauthorizations by using other legislative vehicles such as budget bills and appropriations bills, which could impact funding for student financial aid programs.\nThere has been increased focus by some in the U.S. Congress on the role that for-profit educational institutions play in higher education. In particular, the HELP Committee held a series of hearings regarding the for-profit education sector and Title IV programs, including a March 2011 hearing specifically entitled \u201cBridgepoint Education, Inc.: A Case Study in For-Profit Education and Oversight.\u201d The hearings of the HELP Committee, and those of other Congressional committees, have focused on various aspects of the for-profit education sector including student debt, recruitment practices, educational quality, student outcomes, the effectiveness of accrediting bodies, and the amount of Title IV funding received by the for-profit education sector. In connection with these hearings, members of Congress have requested a broad range of detailed information from various for-profit institutions, including Ashford University and University of the Rockies. On July 29, 2012, the majority staff of the HELP Committee issued a report entitled \u201cFor Profit Higher Education: The Failure to Safeguard the Federal Investment and Ensure Student Success,\u201d which contains the majority staff's findings from the committee's two-year investigation of the for-profit education sector. The report is critical of the sector generally and of us and our institutions specifically, expressing\nconcerns surrounding the amount of Title IV and other federal funds received, the amount of money spent on marketing and recruiting, student retention and default rates, staffing levels, learning outcomes and accreditation, among other items.\nCertain members of Congress have proposed legislation that could have an adverse impact on our institutions. Even if this proposed legislation does not pass during the session in which it is introduced, it may be reintroduced or similar legislation may be proposed, or it may serve as a basis of discussion during the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act.\nWe cannot predict what legislation, if any, will arise out of the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, the HELP Committee hearings or other Congressional deliberations, or what impact any such legislation might have on the for-profit education sector and our business in particular. However, any action by the U.S. Congress that significantly reduces Title IV program funding or the eligibility of our institutions or students to participate in Title IV programs, or that requires us to modify our practices in ways that could increase our administrative costs and reduce our profit margin, would have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nIf WSCUC or HLC loses recognition by the Department, our institutions could lose their ability to participate in Title IV programs.\nIn order to participate in Title IV programs, an institution must be accredited by an accrediting body recognized by the Department. Both WSCUC and HLC are recognized by the Department. If the Department ceased to recognize WSCUC or HLC for any reason, Ashford University or University of the Rockies, as applicable, would not be eligible to participate in Title IV programs unless the Department continued to certify the eligibility of the institutions to participate in Title IV programs. The Department may continue to certify an institution for a period of no longer than 18 months after the date on which recognition of the accrediting body ceased. The ineligibility of our institutions to participate in Title IV programs would have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur institutions could lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or face other sanctions if they derive more than 90% of their respective revenues from these programs.\nUnder the Higher Education Act, a proprietary institution loses eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if the institution derives more than 90% of its revenues (calculated in accordance with applicable Department regulations) from Title IV program funds for two consecutive fiscal years. This rule is commonly referred to as the \u201c90/10 rule.\u201d Any institution that violates the 90/10 rule for two consecutive fiscal years becomes ineligible to participate in Title IV programs for at least two fiscal years. In addition, an institution whose rate exceeds 90% for any single year will be placed on provisional certification and may be subject to other enforcement measures. In the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, Ashford University derived 80.9%, 83.4% and 85.6%, respectively, and University of the Rockies derived 86.6%, 88.3% and 87.6%, respectively, of their respective revenues (calculated in accordance with applicable Department regulations) from Title IV program funds. Both Ashford University and University of the Rockies continue to monitor these calculations.\nRevenue derived from government tuition assistance for military personnel, including veterans, is not considered federal student aid for purposes of the 90/10 calculation, and accordingly helps our institutions satisfy the 90/10 rule. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 28.0% of our institutions' students were affiliated with the military, some of whom are eligible to receive government tuition assistance that may be used to pursue postsecondary degrees. If there were a reduction in funding of government tuition assistance for military personnel, including veterans, or if our revenue derived from such funding were otherwise to decrease, it could be significantly more difficult for our institutions to satisfy the 90/10 rule. In addition, recent changes in federal law that increased Title IV grant and loan limits, and any such additional increases in the future, may result in an increase in the revenues we receive from Title IV programs and make it more difficult for our institutions to satisfy the 90/10 rule. Failure to satisfy the 90/10 rule could result in our institutions losing eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, which would have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nThe U.S. Congress could propose and adopt legislation that amends the 90/10 rule in ways that make it more difficult for our institutions to satisfy the 90/10 rule. For example, in late 2011, the Ensuring Quality Education for Veterans Act was introduced, which proposed to treat government tuition assistance for military personnel, including veterans, as federal student aid for purposes of calculations under the 90/10 rule. Similarly, in January 2012, Senator Richard Durbin introduced the Protecting Our Students and Taxpayers Act, which proposed to have a proprietary institution lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if the institution derives more than 85% its revenues (calculated in accordance with applicable Department regulations) from federal funds (including Title IV programs, government tuition assistance for military personnel, including veterans, and other sources of federal funds) for one fiscal year. The bill would also make it harder for institutions to use institutional loans (i.e., loans the institutions make to students) to help satisfy the 90/10 rule. On November 6, 2013, Senators Richard Durbin and Tom Harkin re-introduced the Protecting Students and Taxpayers Act of 2013, which proposed to have a for-profit institution lose eligibility to participate in Title IV funds if the institution derives more than 85% of its revenues from\nfederal funds, including Title IV programs, revenue from the GI Bill and Department of Defense Tuition Assistance funds. If one or more of these or similar bills were to be enacted and signed into law, it could be significantly more difficult for our institutions to satisfy the 90/10 rule (or, potentially, the new 85/15 rule) and they could lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, which would have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur institutions could lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or face other sanctions if they pay incentive compensation to persons or entities involved in certain recruiting, admissions or financial aid awarding activities.\nThe Higher Education Act prohibits an institution from making any commission, bonus or other incentive payment based directly or indirectly on securing enrollments or financial aid to any persons or entities involved in student recruiting or admissions activities, or in making decisions about the award of student financial assistance. For additional information, see \u201cRegulation - Department Regulation of Title IV Programs - Incentive compensation\u201d in Item 1, \"Business.\" The criteria for compliance with the Department's rules prohibiting incentive compensation are not clear in all circumstances, and the Department will not review or approve compensation plans prior to their implementation.\nIn Finding 1 of the OIG's final audit report related to its compliance audit of Ashford University, the OIG asserted that Ashford University, during the 2006-2007 award year, designed a compensation plan for admissions counselors that provided incentive payments based on success in securing enrollments and did not establish that its plan and practices qualified for certain regulatory safe harbors. To the extent Ashford University cannot establish that its salary adjustments for admissions counselors in the 2006-2007 award year qualified for the regulatory safe harbors, the OIG recommended that the FSA take appropriate action to impose a fine on the university or to limit, suspend or terminate the institution's eligibility for Title IV programs. For additional information regarding the OIG's final audit report, see \u201cRegulation - Department Regulation of Title IV Programs - Compliance reviews, audits and reports\u201d in Item 1, \"Business.\"\nOn October 10, 2012, we received a letter from the Justice Department informing us that the Justice Department was investigating the compensation of our admissions personnel. In January 2013, we were notified that the Justice Department had declined to intervene in a qui tam complaint unsealed on January 2, 2013. The qui tam complaint alleges, among other things, that Ashford University violated the federal False Claims Act by falsely certifying to the Department that the university was in compliance with various regulations regarding the payment of incentive compensation to enrollment personnel in connection with the institution's participation in student financial aid programs. In March 2015, we filed a motion to dismiss the case, which was granted without leave to amend on August 17, 2015. The case is currently under appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. During the pendency of the appeal, the parties agreed to settle the case for an immaterial amount and are in the process of finalizing a settlement agreement.\nIf it were determined that one of our institutions violated the incentive compensation rule, it could be subject to monetary liabilities or to administrative action to impose a fine or to limit, suspend or terminate its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, which could have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nChanges in compensation practices for admissions counselors and other covered employees may negatively impact our business and growth prospects.\nEffective July 1, 2011, the Department eliminated 12 safe harbors describing compensation arrangements that did not violate the incentive compensation rule, including the payment and adjustment of salaries and bonuses under certain conditions. For additional information regarding the elimination of the safe harbors, see \u201cRegulation - Department Regulation of Title IV Programs - Incentive compensation\u201d in Item 1, \"Business.\" Our institutions modified some of their compensation practices as a result of the elimination of the safe harbors. These changes have affected, and may continue to affect, the ability of our institutions to compensate admissions counselors and other covered employees in a manner that appropriately reflects their relative merit, which in turn (i) has reduced, and may continue to reduce, employee effectiveness and our ability to attract and retain staff with the desired talent and motivation to succeed and (ii) has impaired, and may continue to impair, our ability to sustain and grow our business, either of which could have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur institutions may lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if too many students default on their loans.\nFor each federal fiscal year, the Department calculates a rate of student defaults over a three-year measuring period for each educational institution, which is known as a \u201ccohort default rate.\u201d An institution may lose its eligibility to participate in the federal Direct Loan and Pell programs if, for each of the three most recent federal fiscal years, 30% or more of its students who became subject to a repayment obligation in that federal fiscal year defaulted on such obligation by the end of the following federal fiscal year. The three-year cohort default rates for Ashford University for the 2012, 2011 and 2010 federal fiscal years,\nwere 15.3%, 15.3% and 16.3%, respectively. The three-year cohort default rates for University of the Rockies for the 2012, 2011 and 2010 federal fiscal years, were 4.3%, 6.6% and 8.0%, respectively. Loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs would have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur institutions may lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or face other sanctions if the Department or other federal agencies determine they have misrepresented the nature of educational programs, financial charges or graduate employability.\nThe Higher Education Act prohibits an institution participating in Title IV programs from engaging in substantial misrepresentation of the nature of its educational programs, financial charges or graduate employability. Under the Department's rules, a \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d is any false, erroneous or misleading statement an institution, one of its representatives, or any ineligible institution, organization, or person with whom the institution has an agreement to provide educational programs, or marketing, advertising, recruiting, or admissions services makes directly to a student or prospective student or any member of the public, or to an accrediting agency, a state agency or the Department. The Department's rules define a \u201csubstantial misrepresentation\u201d as any misrepresentation on which the person to whom it was made could reasonably be expected to rely, or has reasonably relied, to that person's detriment. Considering the broad definition of \u201csubstantial misrepresentation,\u201d it is possible that, despite our training efforts and compliance programs, our institutions' employees or service providers may make statements that could be construed as substantial misrepresentations. For-profit educational institutions are also subject to the general deceptive practices jurisdiction of the FTC and the CFPB. The FTC and the CFPB are intensifying their regulatory scrutiny of our industry and related vendors, sometimes in coordination with the Department and state Attorneys General.\nOn August 10, 2015, we received from the CFPB Civil Investigative Demands related to the CFPB's investigation to determine whether for-profit post-secondary education companies or other unnamed persons have engaged in or are engaging in unlawful acts or practices related to the advertising, marketing or origination of private student loans. We, together with Ashford University, expect to provide documents, testimony and other information to the CFPB, and cannot predict the eventual scope, duration or outcome of the investigation at this time.\nOn December 10, 2015, Ashford University received a request for information from the Multi-Regional and Foreign School Participation Division of the FSA for (i) advertising and marketing materials provided to prospective students regarding the transferability of certain credit, (ii) documents produced in response to the CFPB's August 10, 2015 Civil Investigative Demand related to the CFPB's investigation to determine whether for-profit post-secondary education companies or other unnamed persons have engaged in or are engaging in unlawful acts or practices related to the advertising, marketing or origination of private student loans, (iii) certain documents produced in response to subpoenas and interrogatories issued by the California Attorney General and (iv) records created between 2009 and 2012 related to the disbursement of certain Title IV funds. The FSA is investigating representations made by Ashford University to potential and enrolled students, and has asked us and Ashford University to assist in its assessment of Ashford University's compliance with the prohibition on substantial misrepresentations. We, together with Ashford University, intent to provide the FSA with our full cooperation with a view toward demonstrating the compliant nature of our practices.\nIf the Department determines that one of our institutions has engaged in substantial misrepresentation, the Department may (i) attempt to revoke the institution's program participation agreement if the institution is provisionally certified, (ii) impose limitations on the institution's participation in Title IV programs if the institution is provisionally certified, (iii) deny applications from the institution for approval of new programs or locations or other matters or (iv) initiate proceedings to fine the institution or limit, suspend or terminate its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. Because Ashford University is provisionally certified, it could be subject to the actions set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above in addition to any other actions taken by the Department if it were determined that Ashford University has engaged in substantial misrepresentation. The imposition of these sanctions, including the loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, would have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur institutions may lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or face other sanctions if they fail to correctly calculate and timely return Title IV program funds for students who withdraw before completing their educational program.\nAn institution participating in Title IV programs must correctly calculate the amount of unearned Title IV program funds that have been disbursed to students who withdraw from their educational programs before completion and must return those unearned funds in a timely manner, generally within 45 days of the date the school determines that the student has withdrawn. For additional information, see \u201cRegulation - Department Regulation of Title IV Programs - Return of Title IV funds for students who withdraw\u201d in Item 1, \"Business.\" Failure to make timely returns of Title IV program funds for 5% or more of students sampled in the institution's annual compliance audit in either of its two most recently completed fiscal years can result\nin an institution having to post a letter of credit in an amount equal to 25% of its prior year returns of Title IV program funds. If unearned funds are not properly calculated and returned in a timely manner, an institution is also subject to monetary liabilities or an action to impose a fine or to limit, suspend or terminate its participation in Title IV programs.\nIn Finding 3 of the OIG's final audit report pertaining to its compliance audit of Ashford University, the OIG asserted that Ashford University, during the 2006-2007 award year, did not in all instances timely return Title IV funds for students who withdrew or went on a leave of absence from school. Accordingly, the OIG recommended that the FSA (i) require Ashford University to develop and implement certain remedial policies and procedures and (ii) take appropriate action to impose a fine on the university or to limit, suspend or terminate the institution's eligibility for Title IV programs, which could have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. For additional information about the OIG's final audit report, see \u201cRegulation - Department Regulation of Title IV Programs -Compliance reviews, audits and reports\u201d in Item 1, \"Business.\" In addition, the Multi-Regional and Foreign School Participation Division of the FSA has requested from us and Ashford University records created between 2009 and 2012 related to the disbursement of certain Title IV funds. For additional information regarding the request for information, see \u201cRegulation - Department Regulation of Title IV Programs - Substantial misrepresentation\u201d in Item 1, \"Business.\"\nOur institutions may lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or face other sanctions if they are not legally authorized to operate in the states in which they are physically located.\nTo be eligible to participate in Title IV programs, an institution must be legally authorized to offer its educational programs by the states in which it is physically located. For additional information, see \u201cRegulation - State authorization\u201d in Item 1, \"Business.\" Although our institutions have a process for evaluating the compliance of their online educational programs with state requirements regarding distance and correspondence learning, and have experienced no material restrictions on their educational activities to date as a result of these requirements, state regulatory requirements for online education vary among the states, are not well developed in many states, are imprecise or unclear in some states and are subject to change. For additional information, see \u201cRegulation - State Education Licensure and Regulation\u201d in Item 1, \"Business.\" Moreover, it is also unclear whether and to what extent state agencies may augment or change their regulations in this area as a result of new Department regulations and increased scrutiny. Any failure to comply with state requirements, or any new or modified regulations, could result in our inability to enroll students or receive Title IV funds for students in those states and could result in restrictions on growth and enrollments.\nAshford University has a campus that is physically located in Iowa. During the time period in which Ashford University was accredited by HLC, ICSAC advised Ashford University that the institution was exempt from a requirement to register with the State of Iowa to offer postsecondary degree programs in Iowa by virtue of its accreditation by HLC. In anticipation of its transition to WSCUC accreditation, Ashford University applied for registration with ICSAC. In November 2011, ICSAC determined Ashford University met all requirements to offer postsecondary education in Iowa and approved the institution's registration in Iowa for a four-year period ending November 2015. Ashford University has submitted a renewal application with ICSAC and is authorized to continue operating in Iowa pending ICSAC's review of the renewal application. However, in light of the findings and recommendations contained in the final audit report of the OIG, ICSAC stated that it would immediately reconsider the institution's registration for possible revocation if the Department ruled to limit, suspend or terminate the institution's participation in Title IV programs. For additional information about the OIG's final audit report, see \u201cRegulation - Department Regulation of Title IV Programs - Compliance reviews, audits and reports\u201d in Item 1, \"Business.\"\nUniversity of the Rockies is located in Colorado and has Full Authorization by the Colorado Commission on Higher Education. Such authorization may be lost or withdrawn if University of the Rockies fails to comply with requirements under Colorado statutes and rules for continued authorization. Any loss of authorization to operate by our institutions and the resulting imposition of sanctions, including loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, could have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur institutions may be required to modify or eliminate certain programs, or certain programs may lose Title IV eligibility, if they do not lead to gainful employment in a recognized occupation, as determined by the Department.\nIn 2014, the Department published Gainful Employment regulations impacting programs required to prepare graduates for gainful employment in a recognized occupation. Almost all academic programs offered by Title IV-participating private sector institutions of higher education must prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation. The Gainful Employment regulations, which became effective July 1, 2015, contain a three-part framework that requires (i) certification by an institution that its gainful employment programs meet certain requirements, (ii) minimum standards to be met regarding the debt burden versus earnings of the graduates of gainful employment programs and (iii) disclosures by an institution regarding the performance and outcomes of their gainful employment programs. The regulations contemplate a transition period in the first several years to afford institutions the opportunity to make changes to their programs and retain Title IV eligibility. For\nadditional information about the Gainful Employment regulations, see \u201cRegulation - Department Regulation of Title IV Programs - Gainful employment\u201d in Item 1, \u201cBusiness.\u201d\nUnder the final Gainful Employment regulations, the continuing eligibility of certain of our educational programs for Title IV program funding is at risk due to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control including, without limitation, changes in the actual or deemed income level of our graduates, changes in student borrowing levels, increases in interest rates, changes in the federal poverty income level relevant for calculating discretionary income, and changes in the percentage of our former students who are current in repayment of their student loans. The factors noted above could reduce our ability to confidently offer or continue certain types of programs for which there is a market demand. Because definitive information necessary to determine how our programs will fare under the accountability measures is not available at this time, we are unable to reliably predict the impact of the Gainful Employment regulations on our enrollments and revenue. However, we are currently using available data to evaluate which programs are at risk of being impacted by the regulations.\nBased on our evaluations using currently available data, we believe that certain of our programs may be impacted by the Gainful Employment regulations. Management is considering whether certain programs will be able to avoid falling into the Fail or Zone categories through adjustments to program price or the duration of programs, if appropriate and consistent with programmatic standards and as permitted by applicable regulations. There can be no assurance that these adjustments will result in compliance with the Gainful Employment regulations. For programs where such adjustments are not feasible or do not result in compliance with the Gainful Employment regulations, we may discontinue such programs. The adjustment or discontinuation of any of our programs, or the loss of Title IV eligibility for certain of our programs if not adjusted or discontinued, could have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Gainful Employment regulations also provide that if a program fails to satisfy at least one of the two tests set forth in the regulations relating to minimum student debt service-to-earnings ratios, the institution will be required to provide a warning notice to prospective and enrolled students advising them that the program may lose Title IV eligibility based on final student debt service-to-earnings ratios for the next award year. If we are required to provide a warning notice with respect to any of our programs, it could have a material adverse effect on enrollment in those programs even before any determination has been made regarding eligibility of the program to participate in Title IV programs, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAshford University and University of the Rockies were notified by the Department that it did not believe the institutions fully responded to the disclosures of data required by the Gainful Employment regulations, that this was an indication of a serious lack of administrative capability, and that as a result the Department would not make any decisions regarding the addition of any new programs or additional locations until the reporting requirements were met. The Department informed us that failure to fully comply in all Gainful Employment data reporting requirements could result in the referral of the errant institution to the Department's Administrative Actions and Appeals Service Group for consideration of an administrative action against that institution, including a fine, the limitation, suspension or termination of institutional eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, or revocation of the institution's program participation agreement (if provisional). We worked with the Department to address their concerns with respect to the reporting of our institutions under the Gainful Employment regulations. The Department has since approved two new programs for Ashford University, and we do not anticipate any actions against our institutions related to this notification.\nThe failure of our institutions to demonstrate financial responsibility may result in a loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or require the posting of a letter of credit in order to maintain eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.\nTo participate in Title IV programs, an eligible institution must, among other things, satisfy specific measures of financial responsibility prescribed by the Department or post a letter of credit in favor of the Department and possibly accept other conditions to the institution's participation in Title IV programs. For additional information regarding the Department's financial responsibility requirements, see \u201cRegulation - Department Regulation of Title IV Programs - Financial responsibility\u201d in Item 1, \"Business.\" If our institutions are found not to have satisfied the Department's financial responsibility requirements, they could be limited in their access to, or lose, Title IV program funding, which would have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nThe failure of our institutions to demonstrate administrative capability may result in a loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.\nDepartment regulations specify extensive criteria by which an institution must establish that it has the requisite administrative capability to participate in Title IV programs. For additional information regarding the Department's administrative capability standards, see \u201cRegulation - Department Regulation of Title IV Programs - Administrative capability\u201d in Item 1, \"Business.\" If we are found not to have satisfied the Department's administrative capability requirements,\nwe could be limited in our access to, or lose, Title IV program funding, which would have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nAshford University and University of the Rockies were notified by the Department that it did not believe the institutions fully responded to the disclosures of data required by the Gainful Employment regulations, that this was an indication of a serious lack of administrative capability, and that as a result the Department would not make any decisions regarding the addition of any new programs or additional locations until the reporting requirements were met. The Department informed us that failure to fully comply in all Gainful Employment data reporting requirements could result in the referral of the errant institution to the Department's Administrative Actions and Appeals Service Group for consideration of an administrative action against that institution, including a fine, the limitation, suspension or termination of institutional eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, or revocation of the institution's program participation agreement (if provisional). We worked with the Department to address their concerns with respect to the reporting of our institutions under the Gainful Employment regulations. The Department has since approved two new programs for Ashford University, and we do not anticipate any actions against our institutions related to this notification.\nOur institutions must periodically seek recertification to participate in Title IV programs and may, in certain circumstances, be subject to review by the Department prior to seeking recertification.\nAn institution must periodically seek recertification from the Department to continue to participate in Title IV programs and may, in certain circumstances, be subject to review by the Department prior to seeking recertification. The current certification for University of the Rockies is scheduled to expire on June 30, 2016. Ashford University is provisionally certified until September 30, 2016. The Department typically places an institution on provisional certification following a change in ownership resulting in a change of control, and may provisionally certify an institution for other reasons including, but not limited to, failure to comply with certain standards of administrative capability or financial responsibility. During the time when an institution is provisionally certified, it may be subject to adverse action with fewer due process rights than those afforded to other institutions, and it must apply for and receive approval from the Department for any substantial change including, but not limited to, the establishment of an additional location, an increase in the level of academic offerings, or the addition of certain programs. The FSA is investigating representations made by Ashford University to potential and enrolled students, and has asked us and Ashford University to assist in its assessment of Ashford University's compliance with the prohibition on substantial misrepresentations. Because Ashford University is provisionally certified, one of the actions the Department may take if it determines Ashford University has engaged in substantial misrepresentation is to attempt to revoke Ashford University's program participation agreement.\nThe Department may also review our institutions' continued certification to participate in Title IV programs if we undergo a change of control. In addition, the Department may take emergency action to suspend an institution's certification without advance notice if it determines the institution is violating Title IV requirements and that immediate action is necessary to prevent misuse of Title IV funds. If the Department revokes, or does not renew, our institutions' certifications to participate in Title IV programs, our institutions' students would no longer be able to receive Title IV funds, which would have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nGovernmental proceedings or other claims and lawsuits asserting regulatory noncompliance could result in monetary liabilities or penalties, injunctions or loss of Title IV programs for students at our institutions.\nBecause we operate in a highly regulated industry, we and our institutions are subject to compliance reviews, claims of noncompliance and lawsuits by government agencies, regulatory agencies and third parties, including claims brought by third parties on behalf of the federal government under the federal False Claims Act. If the results of these reviews or proceedings are unfavorable to us or if we are unable to defend successfully against such lawsuits or claims, we may be required to pay money damages or be subject to fines, limitations, loss of Title IV funding, injunctions or other penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Even if we adequately address issues raised by an agency review or successfully defend a lawsuit or claim, we may have to divert significant financial and management resources from our ongoing business operations to address issues raised by those reviews or to defend against those lawsuits or claims. Claims and lawsuits brought against us may damage our reputation or adversely affect our stock price, even if such claims and lawsuits are eventually determined to be without merit.\nFor additional information regarding the incentive compensation rule, see \u201cRegulation - Department Regulation of Title IV Programs - Incentive compensation\u201d in Item 1, \"Business.\" For more information regarding claims and lawsuits, see Note 21, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d to our annual consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nThe failure of our institutions to demonstrate compliance with state laws may result in liability to, or remedial action against, our institutions, including recoupment by the Department of discharged student loan funds under the \u201cdefense to repayment\u201d provisions of the Federal Direct Loan Program regulations.\nOn June 8, 2015, the Department held a press conference and released a document entitled \u201cFact Sheet: Protecting Students from Abusive Career Colleges\u201d in which the Department announced processes that will be established to assist students who may have been the victims of fraud in gaining relief under the \u201cdefense to repayment\u201d provisions of the Federal Direct Loan Program regulations. Rarely used in the past, the defense to repayment provisions allow a student to assert as a defense against repayment of federal Direct Loans any commission of fraud or other violation of applicable state law by the school related to such loans or the educational services paid for. The processes outlined by the Department on June 8 include (i) extending debt relief eligibility to groups of students where possible, (ii) providing loan forbearance and pausing payments while claims are being resolved, (iii) appointing a Special Master dedicated to borrower defense issues for students who believe they have a defense to repayment, (iv) establishing a streamlined process and (v) building a better system for debt relief for the future. The Department noted that building a better system for debt relief would involve developing new regulations to clarify and streamline loan forgiveness under the defense to repayment provisions, while maintaining or enhancing current consumer protection standards and strengthening provisions that hold schools accountable for actions that result in loan discharges. As part of its efforts to hold schools accountable, the Department could seek recoupment of any discharged federal Direct Loan funds form the school. The Department stated that they will continue to take aggressive action to ensure defrauded borrowers get the debt relief they are entitled to, step up oversight and enforcement to identify schools that present the greatest risk to students and taxpayers, and hold schools accountable for their actions.\nOn August 20, 2015, the Department announced its intention to establish a negotiated rulemaking committee to prepare proposed regulations for the Federal Student Aid programs authorized under Title IV of the Higher Education Act. The Department held two public hearings in September 2015 at which interested parties commented on the topics suggested by the Department and suggested additional topics that should be considered for action by the negotiating committee. The Department also accepted written comments and suggestions. The Department intends to convene a committee to develop proposed regulations for determining which acts or omissions of an institution of higher education a borrower may assert as a defense to repayment, and the consequences of the assertion of such borrower defenses for borrowers, institutions and the Department. Specifically, the Department intends to address (i) the procedures to be used for a borrower to establish a defense to repayment, (ii) the criteria the Department will use to identify acts or omissions of an institution that constitute defenses to repayment, (iii) the standards and procedures the Department will use to determine the liability of the institution for amounts based on borrower defenses and (iv) the effect of borrower defenses on institutional capability assessments. The committee met in January and February of 2016, and is scheduled to meet again in March 2016.\nIn addition to relief under the defense to repayment provisions, students may qualify for a closed school discharge pursuant to which they receive forgiveness of the federal Direct Loans, FFEL Program loans or federal Perkins Loans they took out to attend a school if the school closes either while they are attending or within 120 days after they withdraw from the school.\nThe failure of our institutions to comply with state laws may result in liability to, or remedial action against, our institutions, including recoupment by the Department of discharged student loan funds under the \u201cdefense to repayment\u201d provisions. The assertion of any claims by our institutions' students under the defense to repayment provisions and any resulting remedial action, or any recoupment by the Department of discharged student loan funds pursuant to either the defense to repayment provisions or a closed school discharge, could damage our reputation in the industry and have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain adequate systems and processes to detect and prevent fraudulent activity in student enrollment and financial aid, our business could be adversely impacted.\nWe are susceptible to an increased risk of fraudulent activity by outside parties with respect to student enrollment and student financial aid programs. Our systems and processes may not always be adequate in the face of increasingly sophisticated and ever-changing fraud schemes. The potential for outside parties to perpetrate fraud in connection with the award and disbursement of Title IV program funds, including as a result of identity theft, may be heightened because we are an online education provider. We must maintain systems and processes to successfully identify and prevent fraudulent applications for enrollment and financial aid.\nThe Department's regulations require institutions that participate in Title IV programs to refer to the OIG credible information indicating that any applicant, employee, third-party servicer or agent of the institution that acts in a capacity that involves administration of the Title IV programs has been engaged in any fraud or other illegal conduct involving Title IV programs. If the systems and processes that we have established to detect and prevent fraud are inadequate, the Department may find that we do not satisfy its \u201cadministrative capability\u201d requirements. This could result in limits on or loss of our institutions' eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, which would adversely affect enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. In addition, our institutions' ability to participate in Title IV programs is conditioned on their maintaining accreditation by an accrediting agency that is recognized by the Secretary of Education. Any\nsignificant failure to adequately detect fraudulent activity related to student enrollment and financial aid could cause our institutions to fail to meet their accrediting agencies' standards. Furthermore, under the Higher Education Act, accrediting agencies that evaluate institutions that offer distance learning programs, as our institutions do, must require such institutions to have processes through which the institution establishes that a student who registers for a distance education program is the same student who participates in and receives credit for the program. Failure to meet applicable accrediting agencies' standards could result in the loss of accreditation at the discretion of such accrediting agencies, which could result in a loss of our institutions' eligibility to participate in Title IV programs and adversely affect enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur institutions cannot offer new programs, expand their physical operations into certain states or acquire additional schools if such actions are not approved in a timely fashion by the applicable regulatory agencies, and Title IV funds disbursed to students enrolled in any such programs, states or acquired schools may have to be repaid if prior approval is not obtained.\nOur operating plans may include the offering of new educational programs by our institutions, some of which may require regulatory approval. In addition, we or our institutions may increase physical operations in additional states or seek to acquire additional schools. Because Ashford University is provisionally certified, it must apply for and receive approval from the Department for any substantial change, including but not limited to the establishment of an additional location, an increase in the level of academic offerings or the addition of certain programs. If we or our institutions are unable to obtain the necessary approvals for such new programs, operations or acquisitions or, in the case of Ashford University, a substantial change, from the Department, WSCUC, HLC or any applicable state education agency or other accrediting agency, or if we or our institutions are unable to obtain such approvals in a timely manner, the ability to consummate such actions and provide Title IV funds to any affected students would be impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. If we or our institutions were to determine erroneously that any such action did not require approval or that all required approvals have been obtained, our institutions could be liable for repayment of the Title IV program funds provided to students in the affected program or at the affected location.\nIf regulators do not approve, or if they delay their approval of, transactions involving a change of control of our company, our ability to participate in Title IV programs may be impaired.\nIf we or either of our institutions undergoes a change of control under the standards of applicable state education agencies, WSCUC, HLC or the Department, we must seek the approval of each such regulatory agency. For additional information, see \u201cRegulation - Department Regulation of Title IV Programs - Change in ownership resulting in a change of control\u201d in Item 1, \"Business.\" A failure by us or one of our institutions to reestablish its state authorization, accreditation or Department certification, as applicable, following a change of control could result in a suspension or loss of operating authority or the ability to participate in Title IV programs, which would have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur failure to comply with regulations of various states could preclude us from recruiting or enrolling students in those states or result in such students being ineligible for Title IV financial aid.\nVarious states impose regulatory requirements on educational institutions operating within their boundaries. Several states have sought to assert jurisdiction over online educational institutions that have no physical location or other presence in the state but that offer educational services to students who reside in the state or that advertise to or recruit prospective students in the state. State regulatory requirements for online education are inconsistent between states and are not well developed in many jurisdictions. As such, these requirements are subject to change and in some instances are unclear or are left to the discretion of state employees or agents. Our changing business and the constantly changing regulatory environment require us to regularly evaluate our state regulatory compliance activities. For additional information, see \u201cRegulation - Department Regulation of Title IV Programs - State Education Licensure and Regulation\u201d in Item 1, \"Business.\" If a state finds we are not in compliance and seeks to restrict one or more of our business activities within that state, we may have to cease recruiting or enrolling students in that state or we may be unable to provide Title IV funds to students in those states, which could have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur regulatory environment and our reputation may be negatively influenced by the actions of other postsecondary institutions.\nIn recent years, Congressional, federal, state and accrediting agency investigations and civil litigation have been commenced against several postsecondary educational institutions. These investigations and lawsuits have alleged, among other things, deceptive trade practices and noncompliance with Department regulations. These allegations have attracted adverse media coverage and have been the subject of federal and state legislative hearings. Although the media, regulatory and legislative focus has been primarily on the allegations made against these specific companies, broader allegations against the overall postsecondary sector may negatively impact public perceptions of postsecondary educational institutions, including Ashford University and University of the Rockies. Such allegations could result in increased scrutiny and regulation of all postsecondary institutions, including ours, by the Department, Congress, accrediting bodies, state legislatures or other governmental authorities.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur financial performance depends on our ability to continue to develop awareness among, and to recruit and retain, students; adverse publicity may negatively impact demand for our institutions' programs.\nBuilding awareness among potential students of Ashford University and University of the Rockies and the programs they offer is critical to their ability to attract prospective students. It is also critical to our success that these prospective students are converted to enrolled students in a cost-effective manner and that these enrolled students remain active in our institutions' programs. Some of the factors that could prevent the successful recruiting and retention of students in our institutions' programs include:\n\u2022\nthe emergence of more and better competitors;\n\u2022\nfactors related to our marketing efforts, including the costs of online advertising and broad-based branding campaigns;\n\u2022\nperformance problems with our online systems;\n\u2022\nour institutions' failure to maintain accreditation, state licensure and eligibility for Title IV programs;\n\u2022\nstudent dissatisfaction with our institutions' services and programs;\n\u2022\na decrease in the perceived or actual economic benefits that students derive from our institutions' programs or programs provided by private sector postsecondary education companies generally;\n\u2022\nadverse publicity regarding us, or online or private sector postsecondary education generally;\n\u2022\nprice reductions by competitors that we are unwilling or unable to match; and\n\u2022\na decline in the acceptance of online education or education provided by private sector postsecondary education companies.\nWe face litigation and legal proceedings that could have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nWe and our institutions are subject to lawsuits, investigations and claims covering a wide range of matters. We are the subject of complaints alleging violations of various laws including, but not limited to, federal securities laws (including a securities class action), the federal False Claims Act and state employment laws, as well as investigations by state Attorneys General in California, Iowa, Massachusetts, New York and North Carolina, the CFPB and the SEC. Derivative shareholder complaints have also been asserted on our behalf against certain of our current and former officers and directors alleging breaches of fiduciary duties, waste of corporate assets and unjust enrichment. These and other legal proceedings could cause us to incur significant defense costs, are disruptive to our normal business operations and could damage our reputation or adversely affect our stock price. An adverse outcome of any legal proceeding could result in monetary losses or restrictions on our business, which could have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nFor additional information regarding current material legal proceedings involving us and our institutions, including investigations by state Attorneys General in California, Iowa, Massachusetts, New York and North Carolina, the CFPB and the SEC, see Note 21, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d to our annual consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nOur bad debt expense as a percentage of revenues is high relative to our competitors. If we are unable to remedy the underlying causes, our bad debt expense could increase, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur bad debt expense is high relative to our competitors and has increased from 4.4% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 to 5.3% for the year ended December 31, 2015. We believe our bad debt expense is primarily driven by operational policies, timing of financial aid processing and collection management. If we are unable to make appropriate changes, or if our changes are not as effective as anticipated, our bad debt expense could increase, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nFuture growth may place a strain on our resources.\nWe experienced significant growth from the time of our initial public offering up through 2012, which increased demands on our management information and reporting systems, data analytics, and financial management controls. Such historical growth, as well as any further growth that we may experience, may place a significant strain on our resources. If we are unable to maintain appropriate internal controls, we may experience operating inefficiencies that could increase our costs. Additionally, if we and our institutions fail to hire and retain appropriate levels of personnel in critical areas, we could experience increased student complaints, delays in completing critical business projects, system down-time for both internal and student-facing applications, and potential regulatory noncompliance, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and prospects.\nA failure of our information systems to properly store, process and report relevant data may reduce our management\u2019s effectiveness, interfere with our regulatory compliance and increase our operating expenses.\nWe are heavily dependent on the integrity of our data management systems. If these systems do not effectively collect, store, process and report relevant data for the operation of our business, whether due to equipment malfunction or constraints, software deficiencies or human error, our ability to effectively plan, forecast and execute our business plan and comply with applicable laws and regulations will be impaired. Any such impairment could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur institutions rely on a third-party vendor for financial aid processing services, but remain responsible for any errors, delays or instances of regulatory noncompliance that may be made by the vendor. If this third-party vendor ceases to provide these services for any reason, our institutions may have difficulty performing these services internally or transitioning to another vendor.\nOur institutions have engaged XBS to provide call center and transactional processing services for their online financial aid student populations, including services related to disbursement eligibility review and Title IV fund returns. Although our institutions monitor the work done by XBS for quality assurance and compliance with Department regulations, errors, delays or instances of regulatory compliance may still occur. Our institutions are ultimately responsible for any such errors, delays or instances of regulatory noncompliance that may be made by XBS, some of which could potentially affect the eligibility of our institutions to participate in Title IV programs. Additionally, if XBS ceases to operate or is unwilling or unable to work with our institutions, or if the engagement with XBS is otherwise terminated, our institutions would be required to either handle financial aid processing services using their own resources or engage another third-party vendor, which transition could be economically disadvantageous, present a distraction to management and applicable business units, and increase the risk of errors and regulatory noncompliance during the transition period, any of which could negatively impact our business.\nOur institutions rely on a third-party vendor to provide the online learning platform for students and related support and hosting.\nWe have a license agreement with eCollege pursuant to which we agreed to license from eCollege an online learning platform for students at our institutions. The eCollege platform is an online learning management system that provides for the storage, management and delivery of course content. This platform also includes collaborative spaces for student communication and participation with other students and faculty as well as grade and attendance management for faculty and assessment capabilities to assist us in maintaining quality. Our institutions rely on eCollege for administrative support and hosting of the applicable systems. If eCollege ceases to operate or is unwilling or unable to work with our institutions, or if the license agreement with eCollege and related agreements are otherwise terminated, the online learning platform for students at our institutions and related administrative support and hosting could be interrupted or become unavailable, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations as a result of our collection and use of personal information, and any violations of such laws or regulations, or any breach, theft or loss of such information, could adversely affect our business.\nPossession and use of personal information in our operations subjects us to risks and costs that could harm our business. We collect, use and retain large amounts of personal information regarding our applicants, students, faculty, staff and their families. We also collect and maintain personal information about our employees in the ordinary course of our business. Our services can be accessed globally through the Internet. Therefore, we may be subject to the application of national privacy laws in countries outside the United States from which applicants and students access our services. Such privacy laws could impose conditions that limit the way we market and provide our services.\nOur computer networks and the networks of certain of our vendors that hold and manage confidential information on our behalf may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, employee theft or misuse, computer hackers, computer viruses and other security threats. Confidential information may also inadvertently become available to third parties when we integrate systems or migrate data to our servers following an acquisition of a school or in connection with periodic hardware or software upgrades. Due to the sensitive nature of the personal information stored on our servers, our networks may be targeted by hackers seeking to access this data. A user who circumvents security measures could misappropriate sensitive information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations. Although we use security and business controls to limit access to and use of personal information, a third party may be able to circumvent those security and business controls, which could result in a breach of student or employee privacy. In addition, errors in the storage, use or transmission of personal information could result in a breach of privacy for current or prospective students or employees.\nPossession and use of personal information in our operations also subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens that could require notification of data breaches and could restrict our use of personal information, and a violation of any laws or regulations relating to the collection or use of personal information could result in the imposition of fines against us or lawsuits brought against us. As a result, we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of these security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these breaches. A major breach, theft or loss of personal information held by us or our vendors regarding our institutions' students and their families or our employees, or a violation of laws or regulations relating to the same, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, result in lawsuits and result in further regulation and oversight by federal and state authorities and increased costs of compliance.\nSystem disruptions and vulnerability from security risks to our technology infrastructure could damage the reputation of our institutions and negatively impact our business.\nThe performance and reliability of our technology infrastructure (including the software and related hosting and maintenance services for our online learning platform, student information system, and lead management system) is critical to our reputation and our ability to attract and retain students. Any system error or failure, or a sudden and significant increase in bandwidth usage, could result in the unavailability of systems to us or our institutions' students and negatively impact our business and reputation. Our computer networks may also be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer hackers, computer viruses, denial of service attacks and other security problems. Although we continually monitor the security of our technology infrastructure and take proactive measures to prevent potential threats, these efforts may not protect our computer networks against all threats of security breaches, which could damage the reputation of our institutions and negatively impact our business and prospects.\nOur expenses may cause us to incur additional operating losses if we do not realize our expected revenues.\nOur spending is based, in significant part, on our estimates of future revenue and is largely fixed in the short term. As a result, we may be unable to adjust our spending in a timely manner if our revenue falls short of our expectations. Accordingly, any significant shortfall in revenues in relation to our expectations would have an immediate and material adverse effect on our profitability. In addition, we anticipate increasing operating expenses to expand program offerings and marketing initiatives. Any such increase could cause material losses to the extent we do not generate additional revenues sufficient to cover those expenses.\nStrong competition in the postsecondary education market, especially in the online education market, could decrease our market share, increase our cost of recruiting students and put downward pressure on our tuition rates.\nPostsecondary education is highly competitive. We compete with traditional public and private two- and four-year colleges as well as with other postsecondary schools. Traditional colleges and universities may offer programs similar to those offered by our institutions at lower tuition levels as a result of government subsidies, government and foundation grants, tax-deductible contributions and other financial sources not available to for-profit postsecondary institutions. In addition, our institutions face continued scrutiny from their accreditors, and some of our competitors, including traditional colleges and universities, have substantially greater brand recognition and financial and other resources than we have, which may enable\nthem to compete more effectively for potential students. We also expect to face increased competition as a result of new entrants to the online education market, including traditional colleges and universities that had not previously offered online education programs.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors and may face competitive pressures that could adversely affect our business. We may be required to reduce our tuition or increase marketing spending in order to attract or retain students or to pursue new market opportunities. We may also face increased competition in maintaining and developing new marketing relationships with corporations, particularly as corporations become more selective as to which online universities they will encourage or offer scholarships to their employees to attend and from which online universities they will hire prospective employees.\nWe may not be able to retain our key personnel or hire and retain the personnel we need to sustain and grow our business.\nOur success depends largely on the skills, efforts and motivations of our executive officers, who generally have significant experience with our company and within the education industry. Due to the nature of our business, we face significant competition in attracting and retaining personnel who possess the skill sets we seek. In addition, key personnel may leave us and may subsequently compete against us. We do not carry life insurance on our key personnel for our benefit. The loss of the services of any of our key personnel or our failure to attract and retain other qualified and experienced personnel on acceptable terms could impair our ability to sustain and grow our business. In addition, because we operate in a highly competitive industry, our hiring of qualified executives or other personnel may cause us or such persons to be subject to lawsuits alleging misappropriation of trade secrets, improper solicitation of employees or other claims.\nIf we are unable to hire new employees or to continue to develop existing employees responsible for student recruitment, the effectiveness of our student admissions efforts would be adversely affected.\nWe intend to (i) hire, develop and train additional employees responsible for student admissions and (ii) retain and continue to develop and train our current student admissions personnel. Our ability to develop and maintain a strong student admissions function may be affected by a number of factors, including our ability to integrate and motivate our admissions counselors, our ability to effectively train our admissions counselors, the length of time it takes those new counselors to become productive, regulatory restrictions on the method of compensating admissions counselors and the competition involved in hiring and retaining them.\nEnrollment and revenues could decrease if government tuition assistance offered to military personnel is suspended, or if such assistance is reduced or eliminated, if scholarships which we offer to military personnel are reduced or eliminated, or if our relationships with military bases deteriorate.\nAs of December 31, 2015, approximately 28.0% of our institutions' students were affiliated with the military, some of whom are eligible to receive tuition assistance from the government that they may use to pursue postsecondary degrees. From October 1, 2013 until October 16, 2013, the U.S. federal government entered into shutdown resulting in the suspension of military tuition assistance. In response, Ashford University implemented a Military Tuition Assistance Grant that covered the equivalent of tuition assistance payments for impacted students starting courses during that period. Although governmental tuition assistance programs were resumed following the shutdown, if such programs are again suspended or otherwise reduced or eliminated, enrollment by military personnel, including veterans, may suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Additionally, if in response to future reductions or suspensions in military tuition assistance, we determine to reinstitute our Military Tuition Assistance Grant or a similar program, our per student revenue from military affiliated personnel would decline.\nWe also maintain relationships with military bases and provide scholarships to students who are affiliated with the military. If our relationship with any military base deteriorates or we reduce or eliminate these scholarships, enrollment by military personnel, including veterans, may suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. However, if we increase our scholarships to students who are affiliated with the military, our per student revenue from military affiliated personnel will decline.\nA decline in the overall growth of enrollment in postsecondary institutions, or in the number of students seeking degrees online or in our core disciplines, could cause us to experience a further decline in enrollment at our institutions.\nWe have experienced overall growth in institutional enrollments and revenues since we acquired Ashford University in 2005. However, enrollment at our institutions declined to 49,159 at December 31, 2015 as compared to 55,823 at December 31, 2014. Additionally, our revenues have declined in recent periods and may continue to decline in the future. In order to return to growth in our revenues and increase enrollment at our institutions, our institutions will need to attract and retain a larger percentage of students in existing markets and expand their markets by creating new academic programs. In addition, if job\ngrowth in the fields related to our institutions' core disciplines is weaker than expected, fewer students may seek the types of degrees that our institutions offer.\nOur success depends in part on our institutions' ability to update and expand the content of existing programs and to develop new programs and specializations on a timely basis and in a cost-effective manner.\nThe updates and expansions of existing programs and the development of new programs and specializations may not be accepted by existing or prospective students or prospective employers of our institutions' graduates. If we do not adequately respond to changes in market requirements by updating and expanding our existing programs or developing new programs, our business will be adversely affected. Even if our institutions are able to develop acceptable new programs, they may not be able to introduce these new programs as quickly as students require or as quickly as our competitors introduce competing programs. To offer a new academic program, our institutions may be required to obtain appropriate federal, state and accrediting agency approvals, which may be conditioned or delayed in a manner that could significantly affect our operations. In addition, to be eligible for federal student financial aid programs, a new academic program may need to be approved by the Department.\nEstablishing new academic programs or modifying existing programs requires investments in management and capital expenditures, additional marketing expenses and reallocation of other resources. We and our institutions may have limited experience with programs in new disciplines and may need to modify existing systems and strategies or enter into arrangements with other educational institutions to provide new programs effectively and profitably. If our institutions are unable to increase enrollment in new programs, offer new programs in a cost-effective manner or otherwise manage effectively the operations of newly established academic programs, our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur failure to keep pace with changing market needs could harm our institutions' ability to attract students.\nOur success depends to a large extent on the willingness of employers to hire, promote or increase the pay of our institutions' graduates. Increasingly, employers demand that their new employees possess appropriate technical and analytical skills and also appropriate interpersonal skills, such as communication and teamwork. These skills can evolve rapidly in a changing economic and technological environment. Accordingly, it is important that our institutions' educational programs continually evolve in response to those economic and technological changes.\nThe expansion of existing academic programs and the development of new programs may not be accepted by current or prospective students or by prospective employers of our institutions' graduates. Even if our institutions develop acceptable new programs, they may not be able to begin offering those new programs in a timely fashion or as quickly as our competitors offer similar programs. If we are unable to adequately respond to changes in market requirements due to regulatory or financial constraints, unusually rapid technological changes or other factors, the rates at which our institutions' graduates obtain jobs in their fields of study could suffer, our ability to attract and retain students could be impaired and our business could be adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to sufficiently protect our proprietary rights and we may encounter disputes from time to time relating to our use of the intellectual property of third parties.\nWe rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, service marks, patents, trade secrets, domain names and agreements with employees and third parties to protect our proprietary rights. We have trademark and service mark registrations and pending applications for additional registrations in the United States and select foreign jurisdictions. We also own the domain name rights for our institutions, as well as other words and phrases important to our business. In addition, we have applied for domestic and international patents for certain technology developed by us. We also have registered copyrights for exemplary business course materials. Nonetheless, as new challenges arise in protecting these proprietary rights online, we cannot assure you that these measures will be adequate to protect our proprietary rights, that we have secured, or will be able to secure, appropriate protections for all of our proprietary rights in the United States or select foreign jurisdictions, or that third parties will not infringe upon or violate our proprietary rights. Despite our efforts to protect these rights, unauthorized third parties may attempt to duplicate or copy the proprietary aspects of our technology, curricula and online resource material, among others. Our management's attention may be diverted by these attempts, and we may need to expend funds in litigation to protect our proprietary rights against any infringement or violation.\nWe may also encounter disputes from time to time over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property, and we may not prevail in these disputes. In certain instances, we may not have obtained sufficient rights to the content of a course. Third parties may raise claims against us alleging an infringement or violation of their intellectual property. Some third-party intellectual property rights may be extremely broad, and it may not be possible for us to conduct our operations in such a way as to avoid all alleged violations of such intellectual property rights. Any such intellectual property claim could subject us to costly litigation and impose a significant strain on our financial resources and management personnel regardless of whether\nsuch claim has merit. Our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type adequately or at all, and we may be required to pay monetary damages, which may be significant, or our institutions may be required to alter the content of their classes to be non-infringing.\nWe may incur liability for the unauthorized duplication or distribution of class materials posted online for class discussions.\nIn some instances, our institutions' faculty members or students may post various articles or other third-party content on class discussion boards. We may incur liability for the unauthorized duplication or distribution of this material posted online for class discussions. Third parties may raise claims against us for the unauthorized duplication of this material. Any such claims could subject us to costly litigation and could impose a significant strain on our financial resources and management personnel, regardless of whether the claims have merit. Our general liability insurance may not cover potential claims of this type adequately or at all, and we may be required to alter the content of our courses or pay monetary damages.\nGovernment regulations relating to the Internet could increase our cost of doing business, affect our ability to grow or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe increasing popularity and use of the Internet and other online services has led and may lead to the adoption of new laws and regulatory practices in the United States or in foreign countries and to new interpretations of existing laws and regulations. These new laws and interpretations may relate to issues such as online privacy, copyrights, trademarks and service marks, sales taxes, fair business practices and the requirement that online education institutions qualify to do business as foreign corporations or be licensed in one or more jurisdictions where they have no physical location or other presence. New laws, regulations or interpretations related to doing business over the Internet could increase our costs and materially and adversely affect enrollments.\nWe may require additional financing in the future and if such financing is not available on terms acceptable to us, it could adversely affect our ability to grow.\nWe believe that cash flow from operations will be adequate to fund our current operating plans for the foreseeable future. However, we may need additional financing in order to finance our plans, particularly if we pursue any acquisitions. The amount, timing and terms of such additional financing will vary principally depending on the timing and size of new program offerings, the timing and size of acquisitions we may seek to consummate and the amount of cash flows from our operations. To the extent that we require additional financing in the future, such financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all and, consequently, we may not be able to fully implement our plans.\nA protracted economic slowdown and rising unemployment could lead to lower enrollment and impact our students' ability to repay their loans.\nWe believe that many students pursue postsecondary education to be more competitive in the job market. However, a protracted economic slowdown could increase unemployment and diminish job prospects generally. Diminished job prospects and heightened financial worries could affect the willingness of students to incur loans to pay for postsecondary education and to pursue postsecondary education in general. As a result, enrollments could suffer.\nIn addition, many of our institutions' students borrow Title IV loans to pay for tuition, fees and other expenses. A protracted economic slowdown could negatively impact their ability to repay those loans which would negatively impact our institutions' cohort default rates. Our institutions' students also are frequently able to borrow Title IV loans in excess of their tuition. The excess is received by such students as a stipend. However, if a student withdraws, we must return any unearned Title IV funds, including stipends. A protracted economic slowdown could negatively impact such students' ability to repay those stipends. As a result, the amount of Title IV funds we would have to return without reimbursement from students could increase, and our results of operations could suffer.\nIf we fail to effectively identify, pursue and consummate acquisitions, either in the U.S. or outside of the U.S., our ability to grow could be impacted and our profitability may be adversely affected.\nAcquisitions are one component of our overall long-term growth strategy. From time to time, we engage in evaluations of, and discussions with, possible domestic and international acquisition candidates. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities, complete acquisitions on favorable terms, or successfully integrate or profitably operate acquired institutions or businesses. There may be particular difficulties and complexities (regulatory or otherwise) associated with our expansion into international markets, and our strategies may not succeed beyond our current markets. If we are unable to effectively address these challenges, our ability to execute this component of our long-term strategy will be impaired, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to grow and our profitability.\nThe acquisition, integration and growth of acquired businesses may present challenges that could harm our business.\nThe successful integration and profitable operation of an acquired institution or business, including the realization of anticipated cost savings and additional revenue opportunities, can present challenges, and the failure to overcome these challenges can have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Some of these challenges include:\n\u2022\nthe inability to maintain uniform standards, controls, policies and procedures;\n\u2022\ndistraction of management's attention from normal business operations during the integration process;\n\u2022\nthe inability to attract and/or retain key management personnel to operate the acquired entity;\n\u2022\nthe inability to obtain, or delay in obtaining, regulatory or other approvals necessary to operate the business;\n\u2022\nthe inability to correctly estimate the size of a target market or accurately assess market dynamics;\n\u2022\nexpenses associated with the integration efforts; and\n\u2022\nunidentified issues not discovered in the due diligence process, including legal contingencies.\nAn acquisition related to an institution or other educational business often requires one or multiple regulatory approvals. If we are unable to obtain such approvals, or we obtain them on unfavorable terms, our ability to consummate a transaction may be impaired or we may be unable to operate the acquired entity in a manner that is favorable to us. If we fail to properly evaluate an acquisition, we may be required to incur costs in excess of what we anticipated, and we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of such acquisition.\nWe may finance a future acquisition with existing funds or funds raised through debt or equity financing. If we use existing funds, we will lower the amount of funds we currently have. If we arrange for alternative financing, we may not be able to obtain such financing on favorable terms. In addition, equity financing could dilute the holdings of our stockholders, which may affect our stock price.\nAn increase in interest rates could adversely affect our institutions' ability to attract and retain students.\nInterest rates have reached relatively low levels in recent years, creating a favorable borrowing environment for students. However, if Congress increases interest rates on Title IV loans, or if private loan interest rates rise, our institutions' students would have to pay higher interest rates on their loans. Any future increase in interest rates will result in a corresponding increase in educational costs to existing and prospective students. Higher interest rates could also contribute to higher default rates with respect to students' repayment of their education loans. Higher default rates may in turn adversely impact our institutions' eligibility to participate in some or all Title IV programs, which could have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nWe face risk in connection with institutional loan programs implemented at our institutions. If students participating in such programs fail to timely repay their loans, our business will be negatively impacted.\nBoth Ashford University and University of the Rockies have institutional loan programs for their online student population. Under these programs, our institutions loan money directly to eligible and qualifying students. If students participating in these programs fail to repay their loans on a timely basis, or at all, it would have a negative impact on our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nWe may not earn enough revenue from Constellation and our other technologies to offset the costs of innovating, developing, deploying and marketing these technologies.\nIn recent periods, we have devoted increasing amounts of resources to innovating, developing, deploying and marketing new technologies such as Constellation and the mobile application technology for our institutions. If we are unable to earn revenue sufficient to offset the costs of innovating, developing, deploying and marketing such technologies, our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nOur failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations governing our activities could result in financial penalties and other costs.\nWe use hazardous materials at our ground campuses and generate small quantities of waste, such as used oil, antifreeze, paint, car batteries and laboratory materials. Additionally, we have identified minor environmental issues at the property near\nthe Clinton Campus. We are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, the use, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous substances and waste, and the clean-up of contamination at our facilities or off-site locations to which we send or have sent waste for disposal. If we do not maintain compliance with any of these environmental laws and regulations, or we are responsible for a spill or release of hazardous materials, we could incur significant costs for clean-up, damages and fines or penalties.\nOur corporate headquarters are located in a high brush fire danger area and near major earthquake fault lines.\nOur corporate headquarters are located in San Diego, California in a high brush fire danger area and near major earthquake fault lines. We could be materially and adversely affected in the event of a brush fire or major earthquake, either of which could significantly disrupt our business.\nWe have a limited operating history. Accordingly, our historical and recent financial and business results may not necessarily be representative of future results.\nWe have a limited operating history on which you can evaluate our business strategy, our financial results and trends in our business. As a result, our historical results and trends, including bad debt expense and our institutions' enrollments and cohort default rates, may not be indicative of future results.\nRisk Related to Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to do so in the future. As a result, you could lose all or part of your investment.\nVolatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent you from being able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid for your shares. The market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past, and may continue to fluctuate significantly for a variety of different reasons, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\na failure to remediate the control deficiencies that constitute the material weaknesses in our internal controls discussed in Item 9A, \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d;\n\u2022\ndevelopments regarding the accreditation or state licensing of our academic institutions, particularly Ashford University;\n\u2022\nour quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\npublic reaction to our press releases, corporate communications and SEC filings;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by research analysts who track our common stock or the stocks of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nseasonal variations in our student enrollment;\n\u2022\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of laws or regulations applicable to our industry or business;\n\u2022\nnegative publicity, including government hearings and other public lawmaker or regulator criticism, regarding our industry or business;\n\u2022\nchanges in enrollment;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022\nlitigation involving our company or investigations or audits by regulators into the operations of our company or our competitors;\n\u2022\nsales of common stock by our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders; and\n\u2022\nchanges in general conditions in the United States and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to such events.\nIn addition, in recent years, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies, including companies in our industry. Changes may occur without regard to the operating performance of these companies. The price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company.\nSales of outstanding shares of our common stock into the market in the future could cause the market price of our stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nIf our stockholders sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline. At December 31, 2015, 45.8 million shares of our common stock were outstanding.\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2015, there were 4.7 million shares of our common stock underlying outstanding stock options and 2.8 million shares of our common stock underlying outstanding stock awards, including restricted stock units and performance stock units. All shares subject to outstanding stock options are eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by the provisions of the applicable stock option agreement and Rule 144 under the Securities Act. If these additional shares of common stock are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline. Under Rule 144, shares held by non-affiliates for more than six months may generally be sold without restriction, other than a current public information requirement, and may be sold freely without any restrictions after one year. Shares held by affiliates may also be sold under Rule 144 after one year, subject to applicable restrictions, including volume and manner of sale limitations.\nIf securities or industry analysts change their recommendations regarding our common stock adversely or cease to cover our company, or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business or industry. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover our company downgrades our common stock, whether as a result of any material weaknesses in our internal controls or other factors, or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nOur principal stockholder has significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval and access to our management.\nAs of December 31, 2015, Warburg Pincus beneficially owned 60.4% of our outstanding common stock. Accordingly, Warburg Pincus may exercise significant influence over the election of our directors, amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and other actions requiring the vote or consent of our stockholders, including mergers, going private transactions and other extraordinary transactions. The ownership position of Warburg Pincus may have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change of control or a change in the composition of our board of directors.\nIn February 2009, we entered into a nominating agreement with Warburg Pincus. Under the nominating agreement, as long as Warburg Pincus beneficially owns at least 15% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, we will, subject to our fiduciary obligations, nominate and recommend to our stockholders that two individuals designated by Warburg Pincus be elected to our board of directors. Additionally, if Warburg Pincus beneficially owns less than 15% but more than 5% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, we will, subject to our fiduciary obligations, nominate and recommend to our stockholders that one individual designated by Warburg Pincus be elected to our board of directors. Two directors affiliated with Warburg Pincus, Patrick T. Hackett and Adarsh Sarma, currently serve on our board of directors.\nWe currently do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment in our common stock is if the price of our common stock appreciates.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future and we intend to use our cash position to grow our business. Consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a positive return on your investment in our common stock will be if the market price of our common stock appreciates.\nYour percentage ownership in the Company may be diluted by future issuances of capital stock, which could reduce your influence over matters on which stockholders vote.\nSubject to the rules of the New York Stock Exchange (the \u201cNYSE\u201d), our board of directors has the authority, without any action or vote of our stockholders, to issue all or any part of our authorized but unissued shares of capital stock.

Issuances of common stock or voting preferred stock would reduce your influence over matters on which our stockholders vote and, in the\ncase of issuances of preferred stock, would likely result in your rights as a stockholder being subject to the prior rights of holders of that preferred stock.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, may depress the trading price of our stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our board of directors that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions:\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares to discourage a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nprovide for a classified board of directors (three classes);\n\u2022\nprovide that stockholders may only remove directors for cause;\n\u2022\nprovide that any vacancy on our board of directors, including a vacancy resulting from an increase in the size of the board, may only be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of our directors then in office, even if less than a quorum;\n\u2022\nprovide that a special meeting of stockholders may only be called by our board of directors or by our chief executive officer;\n\u2022\nprovide that action by written consent of the stockholders may be taken only if the board of directors first approves such action, except that if Warburg Pincus holds at least 50% of our outstanding capital stock on a fully diluted basis, whenever the vote of stockholders is required at a meeting for any corporate action, the meeting and vote of stockholders may be dispensed with, and the action may be taken without such meeting and vote, if a written consent is signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at the meeting of stockholders; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, we will hold an annual meeting of stockholders in accordance with NYSE rules for so long as our shares are listed on the NYSE, and as otherwise required by the bylaws;\n\u2022\nprovide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nAdditionally, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder.", "PERMNO": 92902, "SIC": 8200, "TIC": "ZVO"}
