These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. You should also refer to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and Item 8 \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nECONOMIC/POLITICAL RISKS\nOur business is dependent on the construction industry and is subject to economic cycles - Our products are principally sold to the U.S. construction industry. Since our business is dependent on spending in both the public and private sector construction markets, our profits are sensitive to the underlying national, regional, and local economic conditions. Construction spending, which is cyclical, is affected by general economic conditions, changes in interest rates, demographic shifts, industry cycles, employment levels, inflation and other business, economic and financial factors that are beyond our control. A downturn in construction activities or spending in Vulcan-served markets, particularly in our top revenue-generating markets, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges in legal requirements and governmental policies concerning zoning, land use, environmental and other areas of the law may result in additional liabilities, a reduction in operating hours and additional capital expenditures - Our operations are affected by numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations related to zoning, land use and environmental matters. Despite our compliance efforts, we have an inherent risk of liability in the operation of our business. These potential liabilities could have an adverse impact on our operations and profitability. In addition, our operations require numerous governmental approvals and permits, which often require us to make significant capital and operating expenditures to comply with the applicable requirements. Stricter laws and regulations, or more stringent interpretations of existing laws or regulations, may impose new liabilities, taxes or tariffs on us, reduce operating hours, require additional investment by us in pollution control equipment, create restrictions on our products or impede our access to reserves or opening new or expanding existing plants or facilities.\nOur business is dependent on the timing and amount of federal, state and local funding for infrastructure - Our products are used in a variety of public infrastructure projects that are funded and financed by federal, state and local governments. In 2019, voters in local jurisdictions in California, Georgia, New Mexico, North Carolina, Texas and Virginia, among others, approved bond and revenue-raising measures to provide additional resources for transportation projects. In 2019, two state legislatures in Vulcan-served areas - Alabama and Illinois - passed new long-term highway funding legislation. The federal FAST Act, a five year, fully-funded road, bridge and public transportation authorization law, is providing assistance to state DOTs and metro areas. However, given varying state and local budgetary situations and the associated pressure on infrastructure spending, we cannot be entirely assured of the existence, amount and timing of appropriations for future public infrastructure projects.\nClimate change and climate change legislation or regulations may adversely impact our business - A number of governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating legislative and regulatory change in response to the potential impacts of climate change. Such legislation or regulation, if enacted, potentially could include provisions for a \u201ccap and trade\u201d system of allowances and credits or a carbon tax, among other provisions.\nPart I\nOther potential impacts of climate change include physical impacts, such as disruption in production and product distribution due to impacts from major storm events, shifts in regional weather patterns and intensities, availability of water and potential impacts from sea level changes. There is also a potential for climate change legislation and regulation to adversely impact the cost of purchased energy and electricity. A number of our facilities are located in desert climates and while we have not experienced any significant shortages of energy or water in the past, we cannot guarantee that we will not in the future. Furthermore, public expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased energy, transportation and raw material costs, and may require us to make additional investments in facilities and equipment.\nThe impacts of climate change on our operations and the company overall are highly uncertain and difficult to estimate. However, climate change legislation and regulation concerning greenhouse gases could have a material adverse effect on our future financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe are subject to various risks arising from our international business operations and relationships, which could adversely affect our business - We have international operations and are subject to both the risks of conducting international business and the requirements of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the FCPA). We face political and other risks associated with our international operations, including our largest production facility located in Playa del Carmen, Mexico. These risks may include changes in international trade policies, such as the United States - Mexico - Canada Agreement (USMCA), imposition of duties, taxes or government royalties, arbitrary changes to permits, zoning classifications or operating agreements, or overt acts by foreign governments, including expropriations and other forms of takings of property. In addition, failure to comply with the FCPA may result in legal claims against us.\nGROWTH AND COMPETITIVE RISKS\nWithin our local markets, we operate in a highly competitive industry which may negatively impact prices, volumes and costs - The construction aggregates industry is highly fragmented with a large number of independent local producers in a number of our markets. Additionally, in most markets, we also compete against large private and public companies, some of which are significantly vertically integrated. Therefore, there is intense competition in a number of markets in which we operate. This significant competition could lead to lower prices and lower sales volumes in some markets, negatively affecting our earnings and cash flows.\nThe expanded use of aggregates substitutes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations - Recycled concrete and asphalt are increasingly being used in a number of our markets, particularly urban markets, as a substitute for aggregates. The expanded use of recycled concrete and asphalt could cause a significant reduction in the demand for aggregates.\nOur long-term success depends upon securing and permitting aggregates reserves in strategically located areas. If we are unable to secure and permit such reserves it could negatively affect our future earnings - Construction aggregates are bulky and heavy and, therefore, difficult to transport efficiently. Because of the nature of the products, the freight costs can quickly surpass the production costs. Therefore, except for geographic regions that do not possess commercially viable deposits of aggregates and are served by rail, barge or ship, the markets for our products tend to be localized around our quarry sites and are served by truck. New quarry sites often take years to develop; therefore, our strategic planning and new site development must stay ahead of actual growth. Additionally, in a number of urban and suburban areas in which we operate, it is increasingly difficult to permit new sites or expand existing sites due to community resistance. Therefore, our future success is dependent, in part, on our ability to accurately forecast future areas of high growth in order to locate optimal facility sites and on our ability to secure operating and environmental permits to operate at those sites.\nOur future growth depends in part on acquiring other businesses in our industry and successfully integrating them with our existing operations. If we are unable to integrate acquisitions successfully, it could lead to higher costs and could negatively affect our earnings - The expansion of our business is dependent in part on the acquisition of existing businesses that own or control aggregates reserves. Disruptions in the availability of financing could make it more difficult to capitalize on potential acquisitions. Additionally, with regard to the acquisitions we are able to complete, our future results will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate these businesses with our existing operations.\nFINANCIAL/ACCOUNTING RISKS\nOur industry is capital intensive, resulting in significant fixed and semi-fixed costs. Therefore, our earnings are highly sensitive to changes in product shipments - Due to the high levels of fixed capital required for extracting and producing construction aggregates, our profits are negatively affected by significant decreases in shipments.\nPart I\nSignificant downturn in the construction industry may result in an impairment of our goodwill - We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances change in a manner that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. While we have not identified any events or changes in circumstances since our annual impairment test on November 1, 2019 that indicate the fair value of any of our reporting units is below its carrying value, a significant downturn in the construction industry may have a material effect on the fair value of our reporting units. A significant decrease in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units could result in the recognition of a material, noncash write-down of goodwill.\nA deterioration in our credit ratings and/or the state of the capital markets could negatively impact the cost and/or availability of financing - We currently have $2.85 billion of debt with maturities between 2020 and 2048. Given our current credit metrics and ratings, together with other factors, we expect to refinance our nearer term debt maturities rather than repay them when due. Furthermore, we expect to finance acquisitions with a combination of cash flows from existing operations, additional debt and/or additional equity. The mix of financing sources for acquisitions will be situationally dependent.\nA deterioration in our credit ratings, regardless of the cause, could limit our debt financing options and increase the cost of such debt financing (whether for refinancing existing debt or financing acquisitions). While we do not anticipate a credit ratings downgrade, and plan to manage our capital structure consistent with investment-grade credit metrics, we cannot assure our current credit ratings.\nA deterioration in the state of the capital markets, regardless of our credit ratings, could impact our access to, and cost of, new debt or equity capital.\nWe use estimates in accounting for a number of significant items. Changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results - As discussed more fully in \u201cCritical Accounting Policies\u201d under Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d we use significant judgment in accounting for:\n\uf0a7goodwill impairment\n\uf0a7impairment of long-lived assets excluding goodwill\n\uf0a7business combinations and purchase price allocation\n\uf0a7pension and other postretirement benefits\n\uf0a7environmental compliance costs\n\uf0a7claims and litigation including self-insurance\n\uf0a7income taxes\nThese assumptions and estimates could change significantly in the future and could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nThe phase-out of LIBOR, or the replacement of LIBOR with a different reference rate or modification of the method used to calculate LIBOR, may adversely affect interest rates - LIBOR is an interest rate benchmark used as a reference rate for a wide range of financial transactions, including derivatives and loans. In July 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. It is unclear whether or not LIBOR will cease to exist at that time (and if so, what reference rate will replace it) or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) has proposed that the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) is the rate that represents best practice as the alternative to LIBOR for use in financial and other derivatives contracts that are currently indexed to United States dollar LIBOR. ARRC has proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR from LIBOR, and organizations are currently working on industry wide and company specific transition plans as it relates to financial and other derivative contracts exposed to LIBOR. Uncertainty exists as to the transition process and broad acceptance of SOFR as the primary alternative to LIBOR. We have three material debt instruments with LIBOR as a reference rate, each of which matures before the end of 2021: 1) $250.0 million floating-rate notes due 2020, 2) $500.0 million floating-rate notes due 2021, and 3) $750.0 million line of credit (none outstanding at December 31, 2019) due 2021. At this time, we cannot predict the future impact of a departure from LIBOR as a reference rate; however, if future rates based upon the successor reference rate (or a new method of calculating LIBOR) are higher than LIBOR rates as currently determined, it may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nPart I\nPERSONNEL RISKS\nOur future success greatly depends upon attracting and retaining qualified personnel, particularly in sales and operations - A significant factor in our future profitability is our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified personnel. Our success in attracting qualified personnel, particularly in the areas of sales and operations, is affected by changing demographics of the available pool of workers with the training and skills necessary to fill the available positions, the impact on the labor supply due to general economic conditions, and our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefit packages.\nDisputes with organized labor could disrupt our business operations - Labor unions represent approximately 11% of our workforce. Disputes with our trade unions, or the inability to renew our labor agreements, may lead to strikes or other actions that could disrupt our business operations leading to higher costs and/or reduced revenues.\nOTHER RISKS\nA significant interruption of our information technology systems or the loss of confidential or other sensitive data, including cybersecurity risks, could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results - As part of our regular review of potential risks, we maintain an information and operational technology risk management program that is primarily supervised by information technology management and reviewed by internal cross-functional stakeholders. As part of this program, analyses of emerging cybersecurity threats as well as our plans and strategies to address them are regularly prepared and presented to senior management, the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors. The Audit Committee, which has oversight responsibility for our information security program, is briefed on such program at least twice annually, and our Chief Financial Officer is briefed on such program at least quarterly. Given our reliance on information technology (our own and our third-party providers\u2019), a significant interruption in the availability of information technology, regardless of the cause, or the loss of confidential, personal, or proprietary information (whether our own, our employees\u2019, our suppliers\u2019, or our customers\u2019), regardless of the cause, could negatively impact our operations. While we have invested in the protection of our data and information technology to reduce these risks and routinely test the security of our information systems network, we cannot be assured that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business. Management is not aware of a cybersecurity incident that has had a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations; however, we could suffer material financial or other losses in the future and we are not able to predict the severity of these attacks. The occurrence of a cyber-attack, breach, unauthorized access, misuse, computer virus or other malicious code or other cybersecurity event could jeopardize or result in the unauthorized disclosure, gathering, monitoring, misuse, corruption, loss or destruction of confidential and other information that belongs to us, our customers, our counterparties, or third-party providers that is processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks. The occurrence of such an event could also result in damage to our software, computers or systems, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our, our customers\u2019, our counterparties\u2019 or third parties\u2019 operations. This could result in loss of customers and business opportunities, reputational damage, litigation, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWeather can materially affect our operating results - Almost all of our products are consumed outdoors in the public or private construction industry, and our production and distribution facilities are located outdoors. Inclement weather affects both our ability to produce and distribute our products and affects our customers\u2019 short-term demand because their work also can be hampered by weather.\nOur products are transported by truck, rail, barge or ship, often by third-party providers. Significant delays or increased costs affecting these transportation methods could materially affect our operations and earnings - Our products are distributed either by truck to local markets or by rail, barge or oceangoing vessel to remote markets. The costs of transporting our products could be negatively affected by factors outside of our control, including rail service interruptions or rate increases, tariffs, rising fuel costs, truck/railcar/barge shortages, truck driver and rail crew shortages, capacity constraints and minimum tonnage requirements. Additionally, inclement weather, including hurricanes, tornadoes and other weather events, can negatively impact our distribution network.\nPart I\nWe use large amounts of electricity, diesel fuel, liquid asphalt and other petroleum-based resources that are subject to potential supply constraints and significant price fluctuation, which could affect our operating results and profitability - In our production and distribution processes, we consume significant amounts of electricity, diesel fuel, liquid asphalt and other petroleum-based resources. The availability and pricing of these resources are subject to market forces that are beyond our control. Our suppliers contract separately for the purchase of such resources, and our sources of supply could be interrupted should our suppliers not be able to obtain these materials due to higher demand or other factors that interrupt their availability. Variability in the supply and prices of these resources could materially affect our operating results from period to period and rising costs could erode our profitability.\nWe are involved in a number of legal proceedings. We cannot predict the outcome of litigation and other contingencies with certainty - We are involved in several complex litigation proceedings, some arising from our previous ownership and operation of a Chemicals business. Although we divested the Chemicals business in June 2005, we retained certain liabilities related to the business. As required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we establish reserves when a loss is determined to be probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Our assessment of probability and loss estimates are based on the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time. Subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of a loss contingency, and could result in an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. For a description of our current significant legal proceedings see Note 12 \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d in Item 8 \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nOur construction paving business may subject us to contractually imposed penalties or lost profits - We operate construction paving businesses in Alabama, Tennessee and Texas. In some instances, including many of our fixed price paving contracts, we agree to complete a project by a certain date. If we fail to complete the project as scheduled, we may be held responsible for costs resulting from the delay. Consequently, the total project cost could exceed our original estimate, and we could experience reduced profits or even a loss on the project.\nWe are involved in certain environmental matters. We cannot predict the outcome of these contingencies with certainty - We are involved in environmental investigations and cleanups at sites where we operate or have operated in the past or sent materials for recycling or disposal. As required by GAAP, we establish reserves when a loss is determined to be probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Our assessment of probability and loss estimates are based on the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time. Subsequent developments related to these matters may affect our assessment and estimates of loss contingency, and could result in an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. For a description of our current significant environmental matters see Note 12 \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d in Item 8 \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d", "PERMNO": 15202, "SIC": 1400, "TIC": "VMC"}
