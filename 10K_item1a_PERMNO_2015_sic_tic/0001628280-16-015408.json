{"cik": "1348334", "company": "BARRACUDA NETWORKS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-05-04", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that affect us. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the price of our common stock could decline.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\nIf we are unable to increase sales of our solutions to new customers and sell additional distinct solutions from our portfolio of solutions to our existing customers, our future revenue and operating results will be harmed.\nOur future success depends on our ability to increase sales of our solutions to new customers as well as to increase sales of additional solutions to our existing customers. The rate at which new and existing customers purchase solutions depends on a number of factors, including certain factors outside of our control, such as customers\u2019 perceived need for security and data protection solutions and general economic conditions. If our efforts to sell our solutions to new customers and additional solutions to our existing customers are not successful, our business and operating results may suffer.\nA substantial majority of our billings in any particular period are derived from sales to customers with whom we began to engage during that same period and therefore our sales and the size and time to close the deals may vary from period to period and be difficult to predict. Given this unpredictability, we may be unable to accurately forecast our sales in any given period. A failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our solutions may adversely impact our future revenue and operating results, and we are unlikely to forecast such effects with any certainty in advance.\nWe rely significantly on revenue from subscriptions, which may decline, and, because we recognize revenue from subscriptions over the term of the relevant subscription period, downturns or upturns in sales are not immediately reflected in full in our operating results.\nOur subscription revenue accounted for 72% and 70% of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015, respectively. Customers that purchase our subscriptions have no contractual obligation to renew their contracts after the initial contract period, which include monthly and annual terms ranging from one to five years, and we may not maintain our historical subscription renewal rates. The substantial majority of our subscriptions are for one-year periods and in fiscal 2016 we continued to see more customers opt for ratable subscription form factors and shorter contract lengths. New or renewal subscriptions, or the average length of such subscriptions, may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including our customers\u2019 level of satisfaction with our solutions and our customer support, the frequency and severity of subscription outages, our solution functionality and performance, changes in customer deployment models, the timeliness and success of solution and enhancement introductions by us and those of our competitors, the prices of our solutions, the prices of solutions offered by our competitors or reductions in our customers\u2019 spending levels. If new or renewal subscriptions decline, our revenue or revenue growth may decline, and our business may suffer. In addition, we recognize subscription revenue ratably over the term of the relevant subscription period. As a result, much of the revenue we report each quarter is the recognition of billings from subscriptions entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewal subscriptions in any one quarter will not be fully reflected in revenue in that quarter, but will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales of our solutions would not be reflected in full in our results of operations until future periods.\nWe have experienced net losses on a GAAP basis in recent periods and may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future. If we cannot achieve or maintain profitability, our financial performance will be harmed.\nWe have not been profitable on a quarterly or annual basis in recent periods and while we generated net income on a U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") basis for the three months ended February 29, 2016, August 31, 2014, May 31, 2014 and February 28, 2014, we experienced net losses on a GAAP basis for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014. While we have experienced revenue growth over these same periods, we may not be able to sustain or increase our growth or achieve profitability in the future or on a consistent basis. Over the past year, we have spent substantial amounts of time and money to develop new security and data protection solutions and enhanced versions of our existing security and data protection solutions to position us for future growth. Additionally, we have incurred substantial expenses and expended significant resources upfront to market, promote and sell our solutions as well as to prepare for and develop solutions which can address the complex infrastructure environments of our customers including hybrid, public cloud and managed service provider solutions. These changes in IT infrastructure are accelerating and are driving significant changes in storage and compute architectures and\nsolution requirements as well as presenting challenges in the security market, which may materially and adversely affect our business and prospects in ways we do not currently anticipate.\nWe also expect to continue to invest for future growth and for the growing prevalence of cloud-based and other alternative IT infrastructures. As a result of our increased expenditures, we will have to generate and sustain increased revenue to achieve future profitability. Achieving profitability will require us to increase revenues, manage our cost structure and avoid significant liabilities. Revenue growth may slow, revenue may decline, or we may incur significant losses in the future for a number of possible reasons, including general macroeconomic conditions, increasing competition, a decrease in the growth of the markets in which we operate, or if we fail for any reason to continue to capitalize on growth opportunities. Additionally, we may encounter unforeseen operating expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may result in losses in future periods. If these losses exceed our expectations or our revenue growth expectations are not met in future periods, our financial performance will be harmed and our stock price could be volatile or decline.\nIf we cannot successfully execute on our strategy and continue to develop, manufacture and market solutions that respond promptly to the security and data protection needs of our customers, our business and operating results may suffer.\nThe security and data protection markets are characterized by constant change and innovation, and we expect them to continue to evolve rapidly. Moreover, many of our customers operate in markets characterized by rapidly changing technologies and business models, which require them to develop and manage increasingly complex enterprise networks, incorporating a variety of hardware, software applications, operating systems and networking protocols. Our historical success has been based on our ability to identify common customer needs and design solutions to address complex IT problems in an organization\u2019s threat vectors including email, web browsing, mobile devices and remote access. Furthermore, our sales and marketing initiatives are primarily focused on higher-growth segments within the security and data protection markets. To the extent we are unable to continue to identify common IT challenges and execute our business model to timely and effectively design and market solutions to address these challenges, as well as to continue to expand our sales to higher-growth segments within the security and data protection markets, our business, operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected. Additionally, our results could be negatively impacted if we are unable to capitalize on growing cloud-based and hybrid deployment, as well as managed service provider solution, opportunities and continue to develop and market virtual appliances and subscription-only solutions for cloud and SaaS applications.\nThe process of developing new technology is complex and uncertain, and if we fail to accurately predict customers\u2019 changing needs, particularly in the higher-growth segments within the security and data protection markets, and emerging technological trends or if we fail to achieve the benefits expected from our investments, our business could be harmed. We believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position and we must commit significant resources to developing new solutions before knowing whether our investments will result in solutions the market will accept. Our new solutions or enhancements could fail to attain sufficient market acceptance for many reasons, including:\n\u2022delays in releasing our new solutions or enhancements to the market;\n\u2022failure to accurately predict market demand or customer demands;\n\u2022\nchanges in customer environments including migration to hybrid, public cloud, private cloud, SaaS applications, and managed service provider solutions;\n\u2022inability to protect against new types of attacks or techniques used by hackers;\n\u2022defects, errors or failures in their design or performance;\n\u2022negative publicity about their performance or effectiveness;\n\u2022introduction or anticipated introduction of competing solutions by our competitors;\n\u2022poor business conditions for our customers, causing them to delay IT purchases;\n\u2022the perceived value of our solutions or enhancements relative to their cost;\n\u2022easing of regulatory requirements around security or storage; and\n\u2022reluctance of customers to purchase solutions incorporating open source software.\nThere can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new opportunities, develop and bring new solutions to market on a timely basis or achieve market acceptance of our solutions, or that solutions and technologies developed by others\nwill not render our solutions or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive, all of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. If our new solutions or enhancements do not achieve adequate acceptance in the market, or if our new solutions or enhancements do not result in increased subscriptions, our competitive position will be impaired, our revenue will be diminished and the negative impact on our operating results may be particularly acute because of the upfront research, development, marketing, sales and other expenses we incurred in connection with the new solutions or enhancements.\nSignificant developments in IT infrastructure deployments, particularly cloud computing and other alternative IT infrastructure technologies, may materially adversely affect the demand for our products.\nDevelopments or changes in IT infrastructure, such as the emergence of hosted cloud storage, SaaS and mobile data access, are driving significant changes in storage and compute architectures and solution requirements as well as presenting significant challenges in the security market, which may materially and adversely affect our business and prospects in ways we do not currently anticipate and have seen these developments and changes accelerate in recent periods. For example in fiscal 2016, we observed a shift in customer deployments as customers moved from on-premises to hybrid, public cloud, SaaS and managed service provider solutions, which led to longer sales cycles and delays in buying decisions, as well as more customers electing one-year renewal terms rather than multi-year arrangements as they evaluate their long-term strategies. The impact of these trends on overall long-term growth patterns is uncertain, especially in resource-constrained environments. The emergence of cloud computing and other alternative IT infrastructure technologies, in which technology services are provided on a remote-access basis, have begun to have, and may continue to have, a significant impact on the market for security and data protection solutions and may result in rapid changes in customer demands. This could be the case even if such advances do not deliver all of the benefits of our solutions. If alternative models gain traction, any failure by us to develop new or enhanced technologies or processes, or to react to changes or advances in existing technologies, could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe have recently introduced, and will continue to introduce, new security and data protection solutions and we may not gain broad market acceptance for these new solutions.\nOver the past year, we have released several new security and data protection solutions and enhanced versions of our existing security and data protection solutions, which address the higher-growth segments of the security and data protection markets including hybrid, public cloud, SaaS and managed service provider deployment options, to incorporate additional features, improve functionality or deliver other enhancements in order to meet our customers\u2019 rapidly evolving demands. The return on our investments in these development efforts may be lower, or may develop more slowly, than we expect. Further, given their recent introduction, we cannot assure you that these solutions will gain broad market acceptance and that they will prove to be profitable in the longer term. Additionally, we intend to continue introducing new security and data protection solutions to respond to the needs of our customers. If we fail to achieve high levels of market acceptance for these solutions or if market acceptance is delayed, or if the market segments we address with our new solutions do not grow as expected, we may fail to justify the amount of our investment in developing and bringing them to market, and our business, operating results and financial performance could be adversely affected.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results and key metrics have varied in the past and may continue to vary and be unpredictable, which may cause our stock price to fluctuate.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results and key metrics have varied from period to period in the past, and we expect that they may continue to fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including:\n\u2022the timing and success of introductions of our new solutions;\n\u2022changes in the growth rate of the security and data protection markets;\n\u2022changes in renewal rates for our subscriptions and our ability to cross-sell additional solutions in a period;\n\u2022\nthe size of orders and the time it takes to close sales, which has increased in recent periods and may continue to increase;\n\u2022the timing of orders from our customers;\n\u2022the timing of our marketing expenditures;\n\u2022the mix of solutions sold;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in demand for our products and services, particularly seasonal variations in customer spending patterns in more than one of our addressable markets;\n\u2022\nthe continued emergence of hosted cloud storage, SaaS and mobile data access which are driving significant changes in storage and compute architectures and solution requirements and related delays in customer buying decisions as they evaluate the impact of changing deployment environments on their long-term IT strategies;\n\u2022\nour ability to control costs, including operating expenses, the costs of hardware and software components, and other manufacturing costs;\n\u2022\nthe costs associated with acquiring new businesses and technologies and the follow-on costs of integration and consolidating the results of acquired businesses;\n\u2022the budgeting cycles and purchasing priorities of our customers;\n\u2022the timing of payments of sales commissions, bonuses or performance earnouts;\n\u2022changes in our distribution strategy to further leverage MSPs and cloud deployments;\n\u2022the timing and potential provision of valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets;\n\u2022the level of perceived threats to network security, which may fluctuate from period to period;\n\u2022government regulations and customer requirements surrounding data storage and protection;\n\u2022\nfines, penalties or changes or increases in liabilities for regulatory actions, litigation, intellectual property settlements or warranty claims;\n\u2022\ndeferral of orders from customers in anticipation of new solutions or solution enhancements announced by us or our competitors or due to changes in deployment architectures;\n\u2022\nthe discontinuation of non-core product offerings;\n\u2022\nany significant changes in the competitive environment, including the entry of new competitors and increased price competition;\n\u2022disruption in our supply chain and the availability of the components of our appliances;\n\u2022levels of solution returns, particularly in connection with our 30-day right to return;\n\u2022the timing of revenue recognition for our sales, which may be affected by the term of subscriptions;\n\u2022\nincreases or decreases caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, since a significant portion of our revenues are received, and our expenses are incurred and paid, in currencies other than U.S. dollars;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions, both domestically and in our foreign markets, which impact purchasing patterns of customers; and\n\u2022future accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies.\nAny one of the factors above, or the cumulative effect of some of the factors referred to above, may result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results, including fluctuations in our key financial metrics. This variability and unpredictability could result in our failing to meet our revenue, billings or operating results expectations or those of securities analysts or investors for any period. In addition, a significant percentage of our operating expenses are fixed in nature and based on forecasted revenue trends. Accordingly, in the event of revenue shortfalls, we are generally unable to mitigate the negative impact on operating results in the short term. If we fail to meet or exceed such expectations for these or any other reasons, our business and stock price could be materially adversely affected and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits.\nWe believe that our brand is integral to our success and if we fail to cost-effectively promote or protect our brand, our business and competitive position may be harmed.\nWe believe that cost-effectively promoting and maintaining awareness and integrity of our company and our brand are vital to achieving widespread acceptance of our existing and future solutions and are important elements in attracting new customers and retaining our existing customers, particularly as we seek to expand internationally. We believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition in our market further intensifies. We have invested and expect to continue to invest substantial resources to promote and maintain our brand and generate sales leads, both domestically and internationally, but there is no guarantee that our brand development strategies will enhance the recognition of our brand or lead to increased sales. For example, we use radio advertisements, signs and billboards in key locations such as airports where target customers often travel and vehicles wrapped in highly-visible branding. We also engage in activities such as promotional events and attending trade shows. Some of our existing and potential competitors have well-established brands with equal or greater\nrecognition than we have. If our efforts to cost-effectively promote and maintain our brand are not successful, our operating results and our ability to attract and retain customers may be adversely affected. In addition, even if our brand recognition and loyalty increases, our revenue may not increase at a level that is commensurate with our marketing spend.\nIn addition, independent industry analysts often provide reviews of our solutions, as well as those of our competitors, and perception of our solutions in the marketplace may be significantly influenced by these reviews. We have no control over what these industry analysts report, and because industry analysts may influence current and potential customers, our brand could be harmed if they do not provide a positive review of our solutions or view us as a market leader.\nWe face intense competition in the security and data protection markets and other markets in which we compete, which are characterized by constant change and innovation, and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position.\nThe markets for security and data protection solutions are intensely competitive and are characterized by constant change and innovation, and we expect competition to increase in the future from larger, well-established competitors and new market entrants. Changes in the application, threat and technology landscape result in evolving customer requirements. Our main competitors in these markets fall into two categories:\n\u2022\nIndependent network security, storage and application delivery vendors such as Check Point Software Technologies, Ltd., CommVault Systems, Inc., Datto, Inc., EMC Corporation, Networks, Inc., Fortinet, Inc., Imperva, Inc., Juniper Networks, Inc., Mimecast Limited, Palo Alto Networks, Inc., Proofpoint, Inc., Symantec Corporation, Veeam Software and Veritas Technologies that offer competing solutions.\n\u2022\nDiversified IT suppliers such as Cisco Systems, Inc., Dell Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, the McAfee division of Intel and International Business Machines that have acquired large security specialist vendors in recent years, that have software- or hardware-based storage solutions or that have the technical and financial resources to bring competitive solutions to the market.\nIn addition, we compete with companies that offer point solutions that compete with some of the features present in our platform. As our market grows, we believe it will attract more highly specialized vendors as well as larger vendors that may continue to acquire or bundle their solutions more effectively.\nMany of our existing competitors have, and some of our potential competitors could have, substantial competitive advantages such as:\n\u2022\nsubstantially greater financial, technical and other resources;\n\u2022\ngreater name recognition, stronger reputations and longer operating histories;\n\u2022\nlarger sales and marketing and customer support budgets and resources;\n\u2022\nbroader distribution and established relationships with distribution partners and customers;\n\u2022\nlower labor and development costs;\n\u2022\nlarger and more mature intellectual property portfolios; and\n\u2022\ngreater resources to make acquisitions.\nIn addition, our larger competitors have substantially broader solution offerings and leverage their relationships based on other solutions or incorporate functionality into existing solutions to gain business in a manner that discourages customers and potential customers from purchasing our solutions, including through selling at low or negative margins, product bundling or closed technology platforms. Potential customers may also prefer to purchase from their existing suppliers rather than a new supplier regardless of solution performance, price or features. These larger competitors often have broader product lines and market focus and will therefore not be as susceptible to downturns in our markets, thereby reducing their overall risk profile as compared to ours. Many of our smaller competitors that specialize in providing protection from a single type of network security threat are often able to deliver these specialized network security solutions to the market more quickly than we can, which could reduce the addressable market for our new solutions or enhancements to existing solutions. Conditions in our market could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements, partnering by our competitors or continuing market consolidation. New start-up companies that innovate and large competitors that are making significant investments in research and development may invent similar or superior solutions and technologies that compete with our\nsolutions and technology. Our current and potential competitors may also establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that may further enhance their ability to compete.\nSome of our competitors have made acquisitions of businesses that may allow them to offer more directly competitive and comprehensive solutions than they had previously offered. As a result of such acquisitions, our current or potential competitors might be able to adapt more quickly to new technologies and customer needs, devote greater resources to the promotion or sale of their solutions and services, initiate or withstand substantial price competition, take advantage of acquisition or other opportunities more readily, or develop and expand their solution offerings more quickly than we do.\nOrganizations may be more willing to incrementally add solutions to their existing IT infrastructure from competitors than to replace it with our solutions. These competitive pressures in our market or our failure to compete effectively may result in price reductions, fewer orders, reduced revenue and gross profits and loss of market share. Any failure to meet and address these factors could seriously harm our business and operating results.\nTo remain competitive, we may be required to make substantial additional investments in research, development, marketing and sales in order to respond to competition, and there can be no assurance that these investments will achieve any returns for us or that we will be able to compete successfully in the future.\nOur business is dependent on overall demand for security and data protection solutions and therefore reduced security and data protection solution spending or overall adverse economic conditions may negatively impact our business and operating results.\nOur business depends on the overall demand for security and data protection solutions. In addition, the purchase of our solutions is often discretionary. Weak global economic conditions, or a reduction in security and data protection solution spending even if economic conditions improve, could adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results in a number of ways, including longer sales cycles, lower prices for our solutions, higher default rates among our customers and channel partners, reduced subscription renewals and lower our sales levels. As global economic conditions continue to be volatile or economic uncertainty remains, trends in security and data protection spending also remain unpredictable and subject to reductions due to credit constraints and uncertainties about the future. Deterioration of economic conditions, as well as economic uncertainty or an economic downturn, may harm our business and operating results in the future.\nWe rely on third-party distributors, channel partners and MSPs to fulfill substantially all of our sales orders and generate customer demand. If our distributors and reseller channel partners fail to perform, our ability to sell our solutions will be limited, and, if we fail to optimize our distributor and reseller channel partner model going forward, our operating results will be harmed.\nSubstantially all of our sales orders are fulfilled by our channel partners, which include distributors and resellers. We depend upon our resellers and MSPs to manage the customer sales process and to generate sales opportunities and our distributors to provide our solutions to our resellers. To the extent our distributors, resellers and MSPs are unsuccessful in fulfilling our sales, managing the sales process or selling our solutions, or we are unable to enter into arrangements with, and retain a sufficient number of high-quality, motivated distributors and resellers in each of the regions in which we sell our offerings, our ability to sell our solutions and operating results will be harmed. In order to support our growth strategy, we continue to expand our distributor, reseller and MSP network, both in the United States and internationally. If we are unable to successfully develop new distributor, reseller and MSP relationships, or if we experience reseller shifts between distributors or any channel conflict occurs, it could negatively impact our ability to meet our revenue and profitability goals.\nWe provide our channel partners with specific programs to assist them in selling our solutions, but there can be no assurance that these programs will be effective. In addition, our channel partners may be unsuccessful in marketing, selling and supporting our solutions. Our channel partners do not have minimum purchase requirements. They may also market, sell and support solutions that are competitive with ours, and may devote more resources to the marketing, sales and support of such solutions. Our agreements with our channel partners may generally be terminated for any reason by either party with advance written notice and our channel partners may stop selling our solutions at any time. We cannot assure you that we will retain these channel partners, that channel partners will sell our solutions effectively or that we will be able to secure additional or replacement channel partners. The loss of one or more of our significant channel partners or a decline in the number or size of orders from them could harm our operating results. In addition, our channel partner sales structure could subject us to lawsuits, potential liability, and reputational harm if, for example, any of our channel partners misrepresent the functionality of our solutions to customers or violate laws or our corporate policies.\nWe have made significant investments in recent periods to support our growth, including investments in our information technology, infrastructure and management team, and these investments may achieve delayed or lower than expected benefits, which could harm our operating results. Furthermore, if we do not effectively manage any future growth, or are unable to improve our systems and processes, our operating results will be adversely affected.\nWe continue to increase the breadth and scope of our offerings and, correspondingly, the breadth and scope of our operations. To support this growth, and to manage any future growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our information technology and financial infrastructure, our operating and administrative systems and our ability to manage headcount, capital and processes in an efficient manner. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, expenses as we invest in international operations and infrastructure such as the expansion of our sales and marketing presence globally, the addition of higher touch sales and marketing field resources to liaise with our channel partners as we continue to grow our sales both domestically and internationally and investments in software systems and additional data center resources to keep pace with the growth in the cloud and cloud-based solutions markets. We continue to make significant incremental investments in product development, corporate infrastructure and broadened distribution, and we intend to continue to invest in development of our solutions, our infrastructure and sales and marketing. We have recognized, and are likely to continue to recognize, the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits, and the return on these investments may be lower, or may develop more slowly, than we expect. If we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments, or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed, our operating results may be adversely affected.\nWe have acquired, and in the future may acquire, other businesses which could require significant management attention, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have in the past made, and may in the future make, acquisitions or investments in complementary companies, solutions and technologies that we believe fit within our business model and can address the needs of IT professionals. With respect to our previous acquisitions, we cannot ensure that we will be able to successfully integrate the technology and resources to increase subscriptions and grow revenue derived from these acquisitions. In October 2015, we acquired Intronis to increase our solution offerings for MSPs. The success of the acquisition of Intronis will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully integrate Intronis\u2019 business and operations and fully realize the anticipated benefits and potential synergies of the acquisition. To realize these anticipated benefits and potential synergies, we must successfully expand product offerings to MSPs at competitive price points. We may be unsuccessful in integrating Intronis and leveraging its technology, resources and existing MSP relationships and the anticipated benefits and potential synergies of the acquisition may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. Any failure to timely realize these anticipated benefits could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIn the future, we may not be able to acquire and integrate other companies, solutions or technologies in a successful manner. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates, and we may not be able to complete such acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. Furthermore, we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates that enhance our subscription offerings. If we do complete acquisitions, we may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals, including increases in subscriptions, and any acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by our customers, investors and industry analysts. Future acquisitions may reduce our cash available for operations and other uses and could result in an increase in amortization expense related to identifiable assets acquired. We may have to pay cash, incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition, each of which could adversely affect our financial condition or the value of our common stock. The sale of equity or issuance of debt to finance any such acquisitions could result in dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations. In addition, our future operating results may be impacted by performance earnouts or contingent bonuses. Furthermore, acquisitions may require large one-time charges and can result in increased debt or contingent liabilities, adverse tax consequences, additional stock-based compensation expense and the recording and subsequent amortization of amounts related to certain purchased intangible assets, any of which items could negatively impact our future results of operations. We may also record goodwill in connection with an acquisition and incur goodwill impairment charges in the future.\nIn addition, if we are unsuccessful at integrating such acquisitions, or the technologies associated with such acquisitions, into our company, the revenue and operating results of the combined company could be adversely affected. Any integration process may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and require significant time and resources, and we may not be able to manage the process successfully. In particular, we may encounter difficulties assimilating or integrating the companies, solutions, technologies, personnel or operations we acquire, particularly if the key personnel are geographically dispersed or choose not to work for us. Acquisitions may also disrupt our core business, divert our resources and require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for development of our business. We may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired technology or personnel, or accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction, including\naccounting charges. If we fail to properly evaluate, execute or integrate acquisitions or investments, the anticipated benefits may not be realized, we may be exposed to unknown or unanticipated liabilities, and our business and prospects could be harmed.\nWe generate a significant amount of revenue from sales outside of the United States, and we are therefore subject to a number of risks associated with international sales and operations.\nSales outside of the United States represented 31% and 32% of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015, respectively. As a result, we must continue to hire and train experienced personnel to staff and manage our foreign operations. To the extent that we experience difficulties in recruiting, training, managing and retaining an international staff, and specifically staff related to sales management and sales personnel, we may experience difficulties in sales productivity in foreign markets. If we are not able to maintain successful channel partner and distributor relationships internationally or recruit additional companies to enter into strategic channel partner and distributor relationships, our future success in these international markets could be limited. Additionally, as sales outside of the United States have typically been denominated in U.S. dollars, fluctuations in exchange rates could cause our products to become relatively more expensive to our customers outside of the United States leading to a reduction in sales to those customers. Furthermore, an increasing portion of our operating expenses is incurred outside of the United States, is denominated in foreign currencies, and is subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. A reduction in sales or an increase in operating expenses due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nAdditionally, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\ngreater difficulty in enforcing contracts and accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods;\n\u2022\nincreased expenses incurred in establishing and maintaining office space and equipment for our international operations;\n\u2022\ngreater costs and expenses associated with international sales and operations;\n\u2022\nmanagement communication and integration problems resulting from cultural and geographic dispersion;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with trade restrictions and foreign legal requirements, including the importation, certification and localization of our solutions required in foreign countries;\n\u2022\ngreater risk of unexpected changes in regulatory practices, tariffs and tax laws and treaties;\n\u2022\nthe uncertainty of protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u2022\ngreater risk of a failure of foreign employees to comply with both U.S. and foreign laws, including export and antitrust regulations, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and any trade regulations ensuring fair trade practices;\n\u2022\nheightened risk of unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies and of improper or fraudulent sales arrangements that may impact financial results and result in restatements of, or irregularities in, financial statements;\n\u2022\nincreased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities;\n\u2022\nthe potential for political unrest, terrorism, hostilities or war; and\n\u2022\nmultiple and possibly overlapping tax structures.\nWe have office locations in various international locations, including Austria, India and the United Kingdom. If we are unable to effectively manage a large and geographically dispersed group of employees or to anticipate our future growth and personnel needs, our business may be adversely affected. As we expand our business, we add complexity to our organization and must expand and adapt our operational infrastructure and effectively coordinate throughout our organization. As a result, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur additional expense related to our continued growth. In addition, the expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional international markets have required and will continue to require significant management attention and financial resources.\nFailure to manage any future growth effectively could harm our ability to gain future international revenues, result in increased costs, negatively impact our customers\u2019 satisfaction with our solutions, and, consequently, materially impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our financial condition and operating results.\nGiven our volume of international sales, a substantial portion of our total revenue is subject to foreign currency risk. For example, 31% and 32% of our total revenue was generated from sales to customers located outside of the United States for the fiscal years ended February 29, 2016 and February 28, 2015, respectively. Additionally, further strengthening of the U.S. dollar could increase the real cost of our solutions to our customers outside of the United States, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. In addition, a portion of our operating expenses is incurred outside of the United States, is denominated in foreign currencies, and is subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Beginning in fiscal 2015, we utilized foreign exchange forward contracts to manage foreign currency risk. If our foreign exchange forward contracts do not successfully manage our foreign currency risk or if we are not otherwise able to successfully manage or hedge against the risks associated with currency fluctuations, our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur business is substantially dependent on sales leads from Internet search engines and if we are unable to generate significant volumes of such leads, traffic to our websites and our revenue may decrease.\nWe generate a substantial portion of our sales leads through visits to our websites by potential customers interested in our solutions. Many of these potential customers find our websites by searching for security and data protection solutions through Internet search engines, particularly Google. A critical factor in attracting potential customers to our websites is how prominently our websites are displayed in response to search inquiries. If we are listed less prominently or fail to appear in search result listings for any reason, visits to our websites by customers and potential customers could decline significantly and we may not be able to replace this traffic. Furthermore, if the costs of search engine marketing services, such as Google AdWords, continue to increase we may be required to increase our sales and marketing expenses, which may not be offset by additional revenue, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nFailure to comply with governmental laws and regulations could harm our business.\nOur business is subject to regulation by various federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies, including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing employment and labor laws, workplace safety, product safety, environmental laws, consumer protection laws, anti-bribery laws, import/export controls, federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations. In certain foreign jurisdictions, these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than those in the United States. Noncompliance with applicable regulations or requirements could subject us to investigations, sanctions, mandatory product recalls, enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, fines, damages, civil and criminal penalties or injunctions. If any governmental sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees. Enforcement actions and sanctions could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nDefects, errors or vulnerabilities in our solutions, the failure of our solutions to block a virus or prevent a security breach or a false detection of applications, viruses, spyware, vulnerability exploits, data patterns or URL categories could harm our reputation and adversely impact our operating results.\nBecause our solutions are complex, they have contained and may in the future contain design or manufacturing defects or errors that are not detected until after their commercial release and deployment by our customers. For example, from time to time, certain of our customers have reported defects in our solutions related to performance, functionality and compatibility that were not detected before shipping the solution. Additionally, defects may cause our solutions to be vulnerable to security attacks, cause them to fail to help secure networks or temporarily interrupt customers\u2019 networking traffic. Because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, our solutions may not be able to protect our customers\u2019 networks. Our security solutions may also fail to detect or prevent viruses, worms or similar threats due to a number of reasons such as the evolving nature of such threats and the continual emergence of new threats that we may fail to add to our threat intelligence database or other virus databases in time to protect our customers\u2019 networks. For example, in fiscal 2015, we and our customers were adversely impacted by the recently discovered Heartbleed vulnerability, which is a vulnerability in the secure sockets layer, as well as a denial of service attack which targeted our Barracuda Email Security Service. In addition, defects or errors in our subscription updates or our solutions could result in a failure to effectively update customers\u2019 solutions and thereby leave our customers vulnerable to attacks. Our data centers and networks may experience technical failures and downtime, may fail to distribute appropriate updates, or may fail to meet the increased requirements of a growing customer base, any of which could temporarily or permanently expose our customers\u2019 networks, leaving their networks unprotected against the latest security threats. Any defects, errors or vulnerabilities in our solutions could result in:\n\u2022\nexpenditure of significant financial and product development resources in efforts to analyze, correct, eliminate or work-around errors or defects or to address and eliminate vulnerabilities;\n\u2022\nloss of existing or potential customers;\n\u2022\ndelayed or lost revenue;\n\u2022\ndelay or failure to attain market acceptance;\n\u2022\nnegative publicity, which will harm our reputation and brand;\n\u2022\nan increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience, or an increased cost of servicing warranty claims, either of which would adversely affect our operating results; and\n\u2022\nlitigation, regulatory inquiries, or investigations that may be costly and harm our reputation and brand.\nFurthermore, our security solutions may falsely detect applications, content or threats that do not actually exist based on our classifications of application type, virus, malware, vulnerability exploits, data or URL categories. This risk is increased by the inclusion of \"heuristics\" analysis in our solutions, which attempts to identify threats not based on any known signatures but based on characteristics or anomalies which indicate that a particular item may be a threat. These false positives, while typical in our industry, may impair the perceived reliability of our solutions and may therefore adversely affect market acceptance of our solutions. Also, our anti-spam and anti-malware solutions may falsely identify emails or programs as unwanted spam or potentially unwanted programs, or alternatively fail to properly identify unwanted emails or programs, particularly as spam emails or malware are often designed to circumvent anti-spam or anti-malware solutions. Parties whose emails or programs are blocked by our solutions may seek redress against us for labeling them as spammers or malware or for interfering with their business. In addition, false identification of emails or programs as unwanted spam or potentially unwanted programs may reduce the adoption of our solutions. If our solutions restrict important files or applications based on falsely identifying them as malware or some other item that should be restricted, this could adversely affect customers\u2019 systems and cause material system failures. Any such false identification of important files or applications could result in damage to our reputation, negative publicity, loss of customers and sales, increased costs to remedy any problem and risk of litigation.\nIf our security measures are breached or unauthorized access to customer data is otherwise obtained or our customers experience data losses, our brand, reputation and business could be harmed and we may incur significant liabilities.\nOur customers rely on our security and data protection solutions to secure and store their data, which may include financial records, credit card information, business information, customer information, health information, other personally identifiable information or other sensitive personal information. A breach of our network security and systems or other events that cause the loss or public disclosure of, or access by third parties to, our customers\u2019 stored files or data could have serious negative consequences for our business, including possible fines, penalties and damages, reduced demand for our solutions, an unwillingness of our customers to use our solutions, harm to our brand and reputation, and time-consuming and expensive litigation. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, often are not recognized until launched against a target, and may originate from less regulated or remote areas around the world. As a result, we may be unable to proactively prevent these techniques, implement adequate preventative or reactionary measures, or enforce the laws and regulations that govern such activities. In addition, because of the large amount of data that we store for our customers, it is possible that hardware failures, human errors or errors in our systems could result in data loss or corruption, or cause the information that we collect to be incomplete or contain inaccuracies that our customers regard as significant. If our customers experience any data loss, or any data corruption or inaccuracies, whether caused by security breaches or otherwise, our brand, reputation and business could be harmed. Moreover, if a high profile security breach occurs with respect to another provider of cloud services, our clients and potential clients may lose trust in the security of the cloud business model generally, which could adversely impact our ability to retain existing clients or attract new ones.\nIf an actual or perceived breach of network security occurs in our internal systems, our services may be perceived as not being secure and clients may curtail or stop using our solutions.\nAs a provider of network security solutions, we are a high profile target and our networks and solutions may have vulnerabilities that may be targeted by hackers and could be targeted by attacks specifically designed to disrupt our business and harm our reputation. We will not succeed unless the marketplace continues to be confident that we provide effective network and security protection. If an actual or perceived breach of network security occurs in our internal systems it could adversely affect the market perception of our solutions. We may not be able to correct any security flaws or vulnerabilities promptly, or at all. In addition, such a security breach could impair our ability to operate our business, including our ability to\nprovide subscription and support services to our customers. If this happens, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nBecause our solutions could be used to collect and store personal information of our customers\u2019 employees or customers, privacy concerns could result in additional cost and liability to us or inhibit sales of our solutions.\nPersonal privacy has become a significant issue in the United States and in many other countries where we offer our solutions. The regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is currently complex and evolving, and it is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. Many federal, state and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. In the United States, these include rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the Federal Trade Commission, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and state breach notification laws. Internationally, virtually every jurisdiction in which we operate has established its own data security and privacy legal framework with which we or our customers must comply, including the Data Protection Directive established in the European Union (the \"EU\") and the Federal Data Protection Act in Germany.\nIn addition to government regulation, privacy advocacy and industry groups may propose new and different self-regulatory standards that either legally or contractually apply to us. Because the interpretation and application of privacy and data protection laws are still uncertain, it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is in conflict with one another, and is inconsistent our existing data management practices or the features of our solutions. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, lawsuits and other claims, we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our software, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Any inability to adequately address privacy concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws, regulations and policies, could result in additional cost and liability to us, damage our reputation, inhibit sales and harm our business.\nWith respect to all of the above, any failure or perceived failure by us or our platform to comply with U.S., EU or other foreign privacy or security laws, policies, industry standards or legal obligations, or any security incident that results in the unauthorized access to, or acquisition, release or transfer of, personally identifiable information or other customer data may result in governmental investigations, inquiries, enforcement actions and prosecutions, private litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity. Such actions and penalties could divert management\u2019s attention and resources, adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows, and cause our customers and channel partners to lose trust in our solutions, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business.\nAny new laws, regulations, other legal obligations or industry standards, or any changed interpretation of existing laws, regulations or other standards may require us to incur additional costs and restrict our business operations. If our privacy or data security measures fail to comply with current or future laws, regulations, policies, legal obligations or industry standards, we may be subject to litigation, regulatory investigations, fines or other liabilities, as well as negative publicity and a potential loss of business. Moreover, if future laws, regulations, other legal obligations or industry standards, or any changed interpretations of the foregoing, limit our customers\u2019 or partners\u2019 ability to use and share personally identifiable information or our ability to store, process and share personally identifiable information or other data, demand for our solutions could decrease, our costs could increase and our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nFurthermore, the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, the laws, regulations, and policies that are applicable to the businesses of our customers may limit the use and adoption of, and reduce the overall demand for, our solutions. Privacy concerns, whether valid or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our solutions particularly in certain industries and foreign countries.\nOur business is subject to the risks of warranty claims and product liability claims and given our 30-day right to return policy on many of our solutions, we may experience increased frequency of returns, any of which may adversely affect our operating results and financial performance.\nOur solutions have contained and may contain undetected defects or errors, especially when first introduced or when new versions are released. Defects or errors could affect the performance of our solutions and could delay the development or release of new solutions or new versions of solutions, adversely affect our reputation and our customers\u2019 willingness to buy solutions from us and adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our offerings. Any such errors or delays in releasing new solutions or new versions of solutions or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose revenue or market share, increase our service costs, cause us to incur substantial costs in redesigning the solutions, cause us to lose significant customers, subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks, any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Furthermore, we offer customers a 30-\nday right to return for many of our solutions which is integral to our sales model. If we experience appliance defects, or if we experience increased frequency of returns, our sales cycles, operating results and financial performance may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the occurrence of hardware or software errors which result in increased warranty or support claims could result in increased expenses or require us to maintain greater warranty reserves which would have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance.\nOur ability to increase sales of our solutions is highly dependent on the quality of our customer support, and our failure to offer high-quality support would have an adverse effect on our business, reputation and operating results.\nOur solutions are designed to be deployed by customers in resource-constrained IT environments. Our customers depend on our support services to assist them with questions as they implement our solutions within their IT infrastructure, and after deployment, our customers depend on our support organization to quickly resolve any issues relating to those solutions. A significant level of high-quality support is critical to ensure high rates of renewals and cross-selling of our solutions. Further, as we continue to broaden our portfolio of solutions, increase the size of our customer base and increase the size of our solution deployments within our customers IT infrastructure, we must continue to adapt our customer support organization to ensure that our customers continue to receive the high level of customer service which they have come to expect. If we fail to effectively assist our customers in deploying our solutions, succeed in helping them quickly resolve post-deployment issues or provide effective ongoing support, it could adversely affect our ability to sell our solutions to existing customers, decrease our subscription renewal rates and harm our reputation with potential new customers, all of which would have an adverse effect on our business, reputation and operating results.\nIf we are unable to hire, retain, train and motivate qualified personnel and senior management, or if our senior management team is unable to perform effectively, our business could suffer.\nOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel and the continued services of our senior management and other key personnel to execute on our business plan and to identify and pursue new opportunities and solution innovations. The loss of the services of our senior management or any of our key personnel, the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel, or delays in hiring required personnel, particularly in engineering and sales and marketing, could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our development and strategic objectives, and may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Although we have entered into employment offer letters with our key personnel, these agreements have no specific duration and constitute at-will employment. Our productivity and the quality of our solutions may be adversely affected if we do not integrate and train our new employees quickly and effectively. Furthermore, if we are not effective in retaining our key personnel, our business could be adversely impacted and our operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nCompetition for highly skilled personnel is often intense, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area where we have a substantial presence and need for highly skilled personnel. We may not be successful in attracting, integrating or retaining qualified personnel to fulfill our current or future needs. For example, we may not be able to successfully integrate or retain personnel from the Intronis acquisition. Also, to the extent we hire personnel from competitors, we may be subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited, or that they have divulged proprietary or other confidential information, or that their former employers own their inventions or other work product.\nOur customer-centric and collaborative corporate culture has contributed to our success, and if we cannot maintain this culture as we grow, we could lose the innovation, creativity and teamwork fostered by our culture, and our business may be harmed.\nWe believe that a critical contributor to our success has been our corporate culture, which we believe fosters innovation, creativity, a customer-centric focus, collaboration and loyalty. As we grow and change, we may find it difficult to maintain these important aspects of our corporate culture, which could limit our ability to innovate and operate effectively. Any failure to preserve our culture could also negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel, continue to perform at current levels or execute on our business strategy.\nWe rely on a single source or a limited number of sources for some of our components. Insufficient supply and inventory may result in lost sales opportunities or delayed revenue, while excess inventory may harm our gross profit.\nOur inventory management systems and related supply chain visibility tools may be inadequate to enable us to forecast accurately and effectively manage the supply of our components. Additionally, we carry little inventory of our appliances or\ncomponents, and we rely on our suppliers to deliver necessary components in a timely manner. Insufficient supply levels may lead to shortages that result in delayed revenue or loss of sales opportunities altogether as potential customers turn to competitors\u2019 solutions that could be more readily available. Additionally, any increases in the time required to manufacture our solutions could adversely affect our business, brand, sales cycle and reputation. If we are unable to effectively manage our supply and inventory, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe currently depend on a single source or a limited number of sources for certain components used in the manufacture of our solutions. We are therefore subject to the risk of shortages in supply of these components and the risk that component suppliers discontinue or modify components used in our solutions. If these suppliers were to discontinue production of a necessary part or component, we would be required to expend resources and time in locating and integrating replacement parts or components from another vendor. In addition, the introduction by component suppliers of new versions of their components, particularly if not anticipated by us, could require us to expend resources to incorporate these new components into our solutions. Our reliance on a single source or a limited number of suppliers involves a number of additional risks, including risks related to:\n\u2022\nsupplier capacity constraints;\n\u2022\nprice volatility;\n\u2022\ntimely delivery;\n\u2022\ncomponent quality;\n\u2022\nfailure of a key supplier to remain in business and adjust to market conditions;\n\u2022\ndelays in, or the inability to execute on, a supplier roadmap for components and technologies; and\n\u2022\nnatural disasters.\nIn addition, for certain components, we are subject to potential price increases and limited availability as a result of market demand for these components. In the past, unexpected demand for computer and network products has caused worldwide shortages of certain electronic parts. If similar shortages occur in the future, our business could be adversely affected. We rely on purchase orders rather than long-term contracts with these suppliers, and as a result we might not be able to secure sufficient components, even if they were available, at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build appliances in a timely manner and, therefore, might not be able to meet customer demands for our solutions, which would have a material and adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nAssertions by third parties of infringement or other violations by us of their intellectual property rights, or other lawsuits brought against us, could result in significant costs and substantially harm our business and operating results.\nPatent and other intellectual property disputes are common in the IT markets in which we compete. Some companies in the IT markets in which we compete, including some of our competitors, own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, which they may use to assert claims of infringement, misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights against us. There also is a market for intellectual property rights and a competitor, or other entity, could acquire intellectual property rights and assert similar claims based on the acquired intellectual property rights. They may also assert such claims against our customers or channel partners. As the number of patents and competitors in our market increase and overlaps occur, claims of infringement, misappropriation and other violations of intellectual property rights may increase. From time to time, we face allegations that we, our customers or our channel partners have infringed, misappropriated and violated intellectual property rights, including allegations made by our competitors or by non-practicing entities. For example, in fiscal 2016 we entered into an intellectual property settlement agreement whereby we agreed to make certain future cash payments to a third party in exchange for a license to certain patents and a covenant by the third party not to sue for any past or future infringement of such licensed patents. Our broad solution portfolio and the number of network and IT markets in which we compete further exacerbate this risk. Any claim of infringement, misappropriation or other violation of intellectual property rights by a third party, even those without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim and could distract our management from our business.\nIn addition, future assertions of patent rights by third parties, and any resulting litigation, may involve non-practicing entities or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant revenue and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence or protection. We cannot assure you that we are not infringing or otherwise violating any third-party intellectual property rights.\nAn adverse outcome of a dispute may require us to, among other things, pay substantial damages including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed a third party\u2019s patents or copyrights; cease making, using, selling, licensing, importing or otherwise commercializing solutions that are alleged to infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property rights of others; expend additional development resources to attempt to redesign our solutions or otherwise to develop non-infringing technology, which may not be successful; enter into potentially unfavorable royalty or license agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies or intellectual property rights or have royalty obligations imposed by a court; and indemnify our customers, partners and other third parties. Furthermore, we have agreed in certain instances to defend our channel partners against third-party claims asserting infringement of certain intellectual property rights, which may include patents, copyrights, trademarks or trade secrets, and to pay judgments entered on such claims. Any damages or royalty obligations we may become subject to, any prohibition against our commercializing our solutions and any third-party indemnity we may need to provide, as a result of an adverse outcome could harm our operating results.\nOur use of open source technology could impose limitations on our ability to commercialize our solutions.\nWe use open source software in our solutions, and although we monitor our use of open source software to avoid subjecting our solutions to conditions we do not intend, the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts. As a result, there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our solutions. From time to time, we may face claims from third parties claiming ownership of, or demanding release of, the open source software or derivative works that we have developed using such software or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. In such an event, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties to continue offering our solutions, to make our proprietary code generally available in source code form, to re-engineer our solutions or to discontinue the sale of our solutions if re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nFailure to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights could substantially harm our business and operating results.\nThe success of our business depends on our ability to protect and enforce our patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights. We attempt to protect our intellectual property under patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, and through a combination of confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions and other methods, all of which offer only limited protection.\nAs of February 29, 2016, we had 59 issued patents in the United States, but this number of patents is relatively small in comparison to some of our competitors and potential competitors. Additionally, as of February 29, 2016, we had 27 pending U.S. patent applications, and may file additional patent applications in the future. The process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. We may choose not to seek patent protection for certain innovations and may choose not to pursue patent protection in certain jurisdictions. Furthermore, it is possible that our patent applications may not issue as granted patents, that the scope of our issued patents will be insufficient or not have the coverage originally sought, that our issued patents will not provide us with any competitive advantages, and that our patents and other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. In addition, issuance of a patent does not guarantee that we have an absolute right to practice the patented invention, or that we have the right to exclude others from practicing the claimed invention. As a result, we may not be able to obtain adequate patent protection or to enforce our issued patents effectively.\nIn addition to patented technology, we rely on our unpatented proprietary technology and trade secrets. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and trade secrets, unauthorized parties may attempt to misappropriate, reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use them. The contractual provisions that we enter into with employees, consultants, partners, vendors and customers may not prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary technology or intellectual property rights and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary technology or intellectual property rights. Moreover, policing unauthorized use of our technologies, solutions and intellectual property is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the United States and where mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be weak. We may be unable to determine the extent of any unauthorized use or infringement of our solutions, technologies or intellectual property rights.\nFrom time to time, legal action by us may be necessary to enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the intellectual property rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could\nnegatively affect our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the additional expense, time and effort required to create the innovative solutions that have enabled us to be successful to date.\nWe rely on the availability of third-party licenses for some of our solutions.\nSome of our solutions include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties. It may be necessary in the future to renew licenses relating to various aspects of these solutions or to seek new licenses for existing or new solutions. There can be no assurance that the necessary licenses will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. The inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms, could result in delays in solution releases until equivalent technology can be identified, licensed or developed, if at all, and integrated into our solutions and may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, third parties may allege that additional licenses are required for our use of their software or intellectual property, and we may be unable to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Moreover, the inclusion in our solutions of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to differentiate our solutions from those of our competitors.\nAs a public company, we are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting. We may not complete our analysis of our internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner, or these internal controls may not be determined to be effective, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nEnsuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. We are in the costly and challenging process of compiling the system and processing documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \"Sarbanes-Oxley Act\"). We may not be able to complete our evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion. During the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective.\nWe do not expect that disclosure controls or internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would cause the price of our common stock to decline, and we may be subject to investigation or sanctions by the SEC.\nWe are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year. This assessment will need to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting.\nWe are required to disclose changes made in our internal controls and procedures on a quarterly basis. However, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act until the date we are no longer an \"emerging growth company\" as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \"JOBS Act\"). At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented, designed or operating. Our remediation efforts may not enable us to avoid a material weakness in the future.\nAdditionally, to comply with the requirements of being a public company, we may need to undertake various actions, such as implementing new internal controls and procedures and hiring accounting or internal audit staff, which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nIf our solutions do not interoperate with our end-customers\u2019 infrastructure, sales of our solutions could be negatively affected, which would harm our business.\nOur solutions must interoperate with our end-customers\u2019 existing infrastructure, which often have different specifications, utilize multiple protocol standards, deploy products from multiple vendors, and contain multiple generations of products that\nhave been added over time. As a result, when problems occur in a network, it may be difficult to identify the sources of these problems. Any delays in identifying the sources of problems or in providing necessary modifications to our software or hardware could have a negative impact on our reputation and our customers\u2019 satisfaction with our solutions, and our ability to sell solutions could be adversely affected. In addition, customers may require our solutions to comply with certain security or other certifications and standards. If our solutions are late in achieving or fail to achieve compliance with these certifications and standards, or our competitors achieve compliance with these certifications and standards, we may be disqualified from selling our solutions to such end-customers, or at a competitive disadvantage, which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf our solutions fail to help our customers achieve and maintain compliance with government regulations and industry standards, our business and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nWe generate a portion of our revenues from our solutions because they help organizations achieve and maintain compliance with government regulations and industry standards. For example, many of our customers purchase our security and data protection solutions to help them comply with the security standards developed and maintained by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (the \"PCI Council\"), which apply to companies that process or store credit card information. Industry organizations like the PCI Council may significantly change their security standards with little or no notice, including changes that could make their standards more or less onerous for businesses. Governments may also adopt new laws or regulations, or make changes to existing laws or regulations, that could impact whether our solutions enable our customers to demonstrate, maintain or audit their compliance. If we are unable to adapt our solutions to changing regulatory standards in a timely manner, or if our solutions fail to expedite our customers\u2019 compliance initiatives, our customers may lose confidence in our solutions and could switch to solutions offered by our competitors. In addition, if regulations and standards related to data security are changed in a manner that makes them less onerous, our customers may view government and industry regulatory compliance as less critical to their businesses, and our customers may be less willing to purchase our solutions. In either case, our business, financial condition and operating results may suffer.\nOur sales to government entities are subject to a number of challenges and risks.\nWe sell to state and local governmental agency customers, particularly schools, and we may increase sales to government entities in the future. Sales to government entities are subject to a number of challenges and risks. Selling to government entities can be highly competitive, expensive and time consuming, often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that these efforts will generate a sale. Government certification requirements for solutions like ours may change and in doing so restrict our ability to sell into the federal government sector until we have attained the revised certification. Government demand and payment for our solutions may be impacted by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations, with funding reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our solutions. Government entities may have statutory, contractual or other legal rights to terminate contracts with our distributors and resellers for convenience or due to a default, and any such termination may adversely impact our future operating results.\nOur failure to generate the significant capital necessary to expand our operations and invest in new solutions could reduce our ability to compete and could harm our business.\nWe may need to raise additional funds in the future, and we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, if at all. If we raise additional equity financing, our stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the per share value of our common stock could decline. Furthermore, if we engage in debt financing, the holders of debt would have priority over the holders of our common stock, and we may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness. We may also be required to take other actions that would otherwise be in the interests of the debt holders and force us to maintain specified liquidity or other ratios, any of which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. If we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms, we may not be able to, among other things:\n\u2022\ndevelop or enhance our solutions;\n\u2022\ncontinue to expand our sales and marketing and research and development organizations;\n\u2022\nacquire or invest in complementary businesses, solutions or technologies;\n\u2022\nexpand operations in the United States or internationally;\n\u2022\nhire, train and retain employees; or\n\u2022\nrespond to competitive pressures or unanticipated working capital requirements.\nOur failure to do any of these things could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe are exposed to the credit risk of some of our distributors, resellers and customers and to credit exposure in weakened markets, which could result in material losses.\nMost of our sales are on an open credit basis. Although we have programs in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate these risks, and our broad customer base and channel partner network mitigate these risks, we cannot assure you these programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks, especially as we expand our business internationally. Additionally, as our accounts receivable continue to increase, these risks, including the risk of doubtful accounts, will be exacerbated. If we are unable to adequately control these risks, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIf our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect, our operating results could fall below expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in our stock price.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in our stock price. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our condensed consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition, stock-based compensation expense, valuation of inventory and accounting for income taxes.\nUnanticipated changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, and our domestic and international tax liabilities will be subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u2022\nexpected timing and amount of the release of tax valuation allowances;\n\u2022\ndetrimental changes in research and development tax credit laws;\n\u2022\ntax effects of stock-based compensation;\n\u2022\ncosts related to intercompany restructurings;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof; or\n\u2022\nfuture earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated earnings in countries where we have higher statutory tax rates.\nIn addition, we may be subject to audits of our income and sales taxes by the Internal Revenue Service and other foreign and state tax authorities. Outcomes from these audits could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nChanges in financial accounting standards or practices may cause adverse, unexpected financial reporting fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations.\nChanges in financial accounting standards or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective. New accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future. Changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our business and financial results.\nOur business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fire, power outages, floods and other catastrophic events and to interruption by man-made problems such as terrorism.\nA significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire, flood or significant power outage could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Both our corporate headquarters and the location where our solutions are manufactured are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity. In addition, natural disasters could affect our supply chain, manufacturing vendors, logistics providers\u2019 or data center hosting providers\u2019 ability to provide materials and perform services on a timely basis. In the event our or our service providers\u2019 IT systems or manufacturing or logistics abilities are hindered by any of the events discussed above, shipments could be delayed, and our solutions could become unavailable resulting in missed financial targets, such as revenue and shipment targets, for a particular quarter. In addition, acts of terrorism and other geo-political unrest could cause disruptions in our business or the business of our supply chain, manufacturers, logistics providers, partners or customers or the economy as a whole. Any disruption in the business of our supply chain, manufacturers, logistics providers, data center hosting partners or customers that impacts sales at the end of a fiscal quarter could have a significant adverse impact on our quarterly results. All of the aforementioned risks may be further increased if the disaster recovery plans for us and our suppliers prove to be inadequate. To the extent that any of the above should result in delays or cancellations of customer orders, or the delay in the manufacture, deployment or shipment of our solutions, our business, financial condition and operating results would be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental requirements, our business, financial condition, operating results and reputation could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to various environmental laws and regulations including laws governing the hazardous material content of our solutions and laws relating to the collection of and recycling of electrical and electronic equipment. Examples of these laws and regulations include the EU Restrictions of Hazardous Substances Directive (the \"RoHS Directive\") and the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (the \"WEEE Directive\"), as well as the implementing legislation of the EU member states. Similar laws and regulations have been passed or are pending in China, South Korea, Norway and Japan and may be enacted in other regions, including in the United States, and we are, or may in the future be, subject to these laws and regulations.\nThe RoHS Directive and the similar laws of other jurisdictions ban the use of certain hazardous materials such as lead, mercury and cadmium in the manufacture of electrical equipment, including our solutions. Currently, we and other manufacturers of our hardware appliances and major component part suppliers comply with the RoHS Directive requirements. However, if there are changes to this or other laws (or their interpretation) or if new similar laws are passed in other jurisdictions, we may be required to re-engineer our solutions to use components compatible with these regulations. This re-engineering and component substitution could result in additional costs to us or disrupt our operations or logistics.\nThe WEEE Directive requires electronic goods producers to be responsible for the collection, recycling and treatment of such solutions. Changes in interpretation of the directive may cause us to incur costs or have additional regulatory requirements to meet in the future in order to comply with this directive, or with any similar laws adopted in other jurisdictions.\nOur failure to comply with past, present and future similar laws could result in reduced sales of our solutions, inventory write-offs, reputational damage, penalties and other sanctions, any of which could harm our business and financial condition. We also expect that our solutions will be affected by new environmental laws and regulations on an ongoing basis. To date, our expenditures for environmental compliance have not had a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows, and although we cannot predict the future impact of such laws or regulations, they will likely result in additional costs and may increase penalties associated with violations or require us to change the content of our solutions or how they are manufactured, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nRegulations related to conflict minerals may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the costs of certain metals used in the manufacturing of our appliances.\nAs a public company, we are subject to certain requirements under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the \"Dodd-Frank Act\") that require us to diligence, disclose and report whether or not our appliances contain conflict minerals. The implementation of these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of the materials used in the manufacture of components used in our solutions. In addition, we will incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to conducting diligence procedures to determine the sources of conflict minerals that may be used or necessary to the production of our appliances and, if applicable, potential changes to appliances, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. It is also possible that we may face reputational harm if we determine that certain of our appliances contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to alter our appliances, processes or sources of supply to avoid such materials.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance.\nFrom time to time, we have released, and may continue to release guidance in our quarterly earnings conference call, quarterly earnings releases, or otherwise, regarding our future performance that represents our management\u2019s estimates as of the date of release. This guidance, which includes forward-looking statements, has been and will be based on projections prepared by our management. These projections are not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and neither our registered public accountants nor any other independent expert or outside party compiles or examines the projections. Accordingly, no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect to the projections.\nProjections are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change. We intend to state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed but are not intended to imply that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges. The principal reason that we release guidance is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors. We do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such third parties.\nGuidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions underlying the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results. Accordingly, our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release. Actual results may vary from our guidance and the variations may be material. We undertake no obligation to make revisions or publicly update our guidance in advance of actual results unless required by law. In light of the foregoing, investors are urged to consider all of the information we make publicly available in making an investment decision regarding our common stock and not rely solely upon our guidance.\nAny failure to successfully implement our operating strategy or the occurrence of any of the events or circumstances set forth in this \"Risk Factors\" section could result in the actual operating results being different from our guidance, and the differences may be adverse and material.\nWe cannot assure you that our stock repurchase program will result in additional repurchases of our common stock or enhance long-term stockholder value, and repurchases, if any, could affect our stock price and increase its volatility and will diminish our cash reserves.\nIn September 2015, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program. Under this program, we are authorized to repurchase shares of our own common stock for an aggregate purchase price not to exceed $50.0 million through September 30, 2017. Although our board of directors has authorized the stock repurchase program, the stock repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares. Stock will be purchased from time to time, in the open market or through private transactions, subject to market condition, in compliance with applicable state and federal securities laws. The timing and amount of repurchases, if any, will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, the trading price of our common stock and the nature of other investment opportunities. As of February 29, 2016, we had purchased approximately 1.5 million shares of common stock under this program at a weighted average price of $12.79 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $19.2 million.\nOur stock repurchase program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility and will reduce the market liquidity for our stock. Additionally, our stock repurchase program could diminish our cash reserves, which may impact our ability to finance future growth and to pursue possible future strategic opportunities and acquisitions. There can be no assurance that any repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock. Although our stock repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the effectiveness of these repurchases.\nOur share price has been and may continue to be volatile, and you may be unable to sell your shares at or above the price at which you purchased your stock.\nTechnology stocks have historically experienced high levels of volatility. The trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance. Furthermore, our stock repurchase program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility and will reduce the market liquidity for our stock. Since shares of our common stock were sold in our initial public offering in November 2013 at a price of $18.00 per share, the reported high and low sales\nprices of our common stock have ranged from $9.44 to $46.78 through February 29, 2016. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our common stock. Factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include:\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n\u2022\nsignificant volatility in the market price and trading volume of technology companies in general, and of companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in our results of operations or fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nwhether our operating results meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in the expectations of investors or securities analysts;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated developments in our competitors\u2019 businesses or the competitive landscape generally;\n\u2022\ndevelopments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022\nlitigation or investigations involving us, our industry or both;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments in the United States, foreign countries or both;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and trends;\n\u2022\nmajor catastrophic events;\n\u2022\nour stock repurchase program;\n\u2022\nsales of large blocks of our stock; or\n\u2022\nmajor changes in our board of directors or management or departures of key personnel.\nIn addition, if the market for technology stocks, or the stock market in general, experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial condition. The trading price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. If our stock price is volatile, we may become the target of securities litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources from our business, and this could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nSales of outstanding shares of our common stock into the market in the future could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly.\nIf our existing stockholders sell, or indicate an intent to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline. As of February 29, 2016, there were 52,135,194 shares of common stock outstanding. All outstanding shares are freely tradable, unless such shares are held by \"affiliates,\" as that term is defined in Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\nIn addition, we have filed registration statements on Form S-8 to register all shares subject to outstanding options and restricted stock units or reserved for future issuance under our equity compensation plans. If these additional shares are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they downgrade our stock, the price of our stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock could be influenced by any research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. In the event securities analysts who cover our company downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nThe concentration of ownership among our existing directors, executive officers and principal stockholders provides them, collectively, with substantial control over us, which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of key transactions, including a change of control.\nOur directors, executive officers and each of our stockholders who own greater than 5% of our outstanding common stock and their affiliates, in the aggregate, own a substantial majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock. As a result, these stockholders, if acting together, are able to influence or control matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers, acquisitions or other extraordinary transactions. They may also have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control of our company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management\u2019s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain executive management and qualified board members.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, the listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange (the \"NYSE\") and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources, particularly after we are no longer an \"emerging growth company,\" as defined in the JOBS Act. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. As a result, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Although we have already hired additional employees to comply with these requirements, we may need to hire more employees in the future or engage outside consultants, which will increase our costs and expenses.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us, and our business may be adversely affected. However, for as long as we remain an \"emerging growth company,\" we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not \"emerging growth companies\" including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an \"emerging growth company.\"\nWe will cease to be an \"emerging growth company\" upon the earliest of: (i) the end of our fiscal year 2019, (ii) the beginning of our first fiscal year after our annual gross revenues are $1.0 billion or more, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities or (iv) as of the end of any fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700 million as of the end of the second quarter of that fiscal year.\nWe also expect that these new rules and regulations will make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee, and qualified executive officers.\nAs a public company, our business and financial condition have become more visible, which we believe may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If such claims are successful, our business and operating results could be adversely affected, and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our management and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe are an \"emerging growth company,\" and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \"emerging growth company,\" as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not \"emerging growth companies\" including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock, and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings for use in the development of our business and for general corporate purposes. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. In addition, our existing credit facility restricts and any future indebtedness may restrict our ability to pay dividends. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur increased costs as a result of being a public company.\nAs a public company, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. In addition, rules implemented by the SEC and the NYSE require certain corporate governance practices by public companies. These rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. We also incur additional costs associated with our public company reporting requirements. These rules and regulations may also make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified people to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and under Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our common stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions:\n\u2022\nestablish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board of directors are elected at one time;\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \"blank check\" preferred stock that our board of directors could issue to increase the number of outstanding shares to discourage a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholders from calling a special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nprovide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022\nprovide that a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for any derivative action brought on our behalf, any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty, any action asserting a claim against us arising under the Delaware General Corporation Law and certain other claims.\nAdditionally, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any \"interested\" stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an \"interested\" stockholder and which may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company.\nThe provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may frustrate or prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. The provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws or Delaware law may also have the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control, which could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.", "PERMNO": 14271, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "CUDA"}
