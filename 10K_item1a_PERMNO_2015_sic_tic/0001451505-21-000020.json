{"cik": "1451505", "company": "Transocean Ltd.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A.Risk Factors\nRisks related to our business\nOur business depends on the level of activity in the offshore oil and gas industry, which is significantly affected by volatile oil and gas prices and other factors.\nOur business depends on the level of activity in oil and gas exploration, development and production in offshore areas worldwide. Demand for our services depends on oil and natural gas industry activity and expenditure levels that are directly affected by trends in oil and, to a lesser extent, natural gas prices. Oil and gas prices are extremely volatile and are affected by numerous factors, including the following:\n\u25fe worldwide demand for oil and gas, including economic activity in the U.S. and other large energy-consuming markets, which has been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the governmental, company and individual reactions thereto;\n\u25fe the ability of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) to set and maintain production levels, productive spare capacity and pricing;\n\u25fe the level of production in non-OPEC countries;\n\u25fe inventory levels, and the cost and availability of storage and transportation of oil, gas and their related products;\n\u25fe the policies, laws and regulations of various governments regarding exploration and development of their oil and gas reserves, the environment and climate change;\n\u25fe international sanctions on oil-producing countries, or the lifting of such sanctions;\n\u25fe advances in exploration, development and production technology;\n\u25fe the further development of shale technology to exploit oil and gas reserves;\n\u25fe the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves and the rate of decline of existing oil and gas reserves;\n\u25fe laws and regulations related to environmental matters, including those addressing alternative energy sources and the risks of global climate change;\n\u25fe the development, exploitation and market acceptance of alternative energy sources;\n\u25fe accidents, adverse weather conditions, natural disasters and other similar incidents relating to the oil and gas industry; and\n\u25fe the worldwide security and political environment, including uncertainty or instability resulting from an escalation or outbreak of armed hostilities, civil unrest, acts of terrorism, public health threats or other crises.\n- 8 -\nDemand for our services is particularly sensitive to the level of exploration, development and production activity of, and the corresponding capital spending by, oil and natural gas companies, including national oil companies. Prolonged reductions in oil and natural gas prices could depress the immediate levels of exploration, development and production activity. Perceptions of longer-term lower oil and natural gas prices by oil and gas companies could similarly reduce or defer major expenditures given the long-term nature of many large-scale development projects. Lower levels of activity result in a corresponding decline in the demand for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability. Oil and gas prices and market expectations of potential changes in these prices significantly affect this level of activity. However, increases in near-term commodity prices do not necessarily translate into increased offshore drilling activity since customers\u2019 expectations of longer-term future commodity prices typically have a greater impact on demand for our rigs. Consistent with this dynamic, customers may delay or cancel many exploration and development programs, resulting in reduced demand for our services. Also, increased competition for customers\u2019 drilling budgets could come from, among other areas, land-based energy markets worldwide. The availability of quality drilling prospects, exploration success, relative production costs, the stage of reservoir development and political and regulatory environments also affect customers\u2019 drilling campaigns. Worldwide military, political and economic events have often contributed to oil and gas price volatility and are likely to do so in the future.\nThe offshore drilling industry is highly competitive and cyclical, with intense price competition.\nThe offshore contract drilling industry is highly competitive with numerous industry participants, none of which has a dominant market share. Drilling contracts are traditionally awarded on a competitive bid basis. Although rig availability, service quality and technical capability are drivers of customer contract awards, bid pricing and intense price competition are often key determinants for which a qualified contractor is awarded a job.\nThe offshore drilling industry is highly cyclical and is impacted by oil and natural gas price levels and volatility. Periods of high customer demand, limited rig supply and high dayrates have been followed by periods of low customer demand, excess rig supply and low dayrates. Changes in commodity prices can have a dramatic effect on rig demand, and periods of excess rig supply may intensify competition in the industry and result in the idling of older and less technologically advanced equipment. We have idled and stacked rigs, and may in the future idle or stack additional rigs or enter into lower dayrate drilling contracts in response to market conditions. Idled or stacked rigs may remain out of service for extended periods of time. During prior periods of high dayrates and rig utilization rates, we and other industry participants responded to increased customer demand by increasing the supply of rigs through ordering the construction of new units. The number of new units delivered without contracts, combined with an increased number of rigs in the global market completing contracts and becoming idle, has increased and may continue to intensify price competition. In periods of low oil and natural gas price levels, new construction has historically resulted in an oversupply of rigs and has caused a subsequent decline in dayrates and rig utilization rates, sometimes for extended periods of time. In an oversupplied market, we may have limited bargaining power to negotiate on more favorable terms. Additionally, lower market dayrates and intense price competition may drive customers to seek to renegotiate existing contracts to lower dayrates in exchange for longer contract terms. Lower dayrates and rig utilization rates could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nAs of February 12, 2021, we have 16 uncontracted rigs, and these rigs may remain out of service for extended periods of time. We also have two additional rigs under construction, and while both have secured contracts, one has a contract that is conditional upon a final investment decision of the customer and its partners. If we are unable to obtain drilling contracts for our uncontracted rigs, whether due to a prolonged offshore drilling market downturn, a delayed or muted recovery of such market or otherwise, it may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nOur current backlog of contract drilling revenues may not be fully realized.\nAt February 12, 2021, our contract backlog was approximately $7.8 billion. This amount represents the number of days remaining in the firm term of the drilling contract multiplied by the maximum contractual operating dayrate, excluding revenues for mobilization, demobilization, contract preparation, other incentive provisions or reimbursement revenues, which are generally insignificant to our contract drilling revenues. Our contract backlog includes amounts associated with our contracted newbuild unit that is currently under construction but excludes amounts related to the conditional agreement we have for our second newbuild unit under construction. The contractual operating dayrate may be higher than the actual dayrate we ultimately receive or an alternative contractual dayrate, such as waiting on weather rate, repair rate, standby rate or force majeure rate, may apply under certain circumstances. The contractual operating dayrate may also be higher than the actual dayrate we ultimately receive due to a number of factors, including rig downtime or suspension of operations. Several factors could cause rig downtime or a suspension of operations, including: equipment breakdowns and other unforeseen engineering problems, labor strikes and other work stoppages, shortages of material and skilled labor, surveys by government and maritime authorities, periodic classification surveys, severe weather or harsh operating conditions, and force majeure events.\nIn certain drilling contracts, the dayrate may be reduced to zero if, for example, repairs extend beyond a stated period of time. Our contract backlog includes only firm commitments, which are represented by signed drilling contracts or, in some cases, other definitive agreements awaiting contract execution. We may not be able to realize the full amount of our contract backlog due to events beyond our control. In addition, some of our customers have experienced liquidity issues in the past, including some recently, and these liquidity issues could be experienced again if commodity prices decline for an extended period of time. Liquidity issues and other market pressures could lead our customers to seek bankruptcy protection or to seek to repudiate, cancel or renegotiate these agreements for various reasons (see \u201c-Our drilling contracts may be terminated due to a number of events, and, during depressed market conditions, our customers may seek\n- 9 -\nto repudiate or renegotiate their contracts\u201d). Our inability to realize the full amount of our contract backlog may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe may not be able to renew or obtain new drilling contracts for rigs whose contracts are expiring or obtain drilling contracts for our stacked and idle rigs or our newbuild with a conditional agreement if the conditions thereof are not satisfied.\nThe offshore drilling markets in which we compete experience fluctuations in the demand for drilling services. Our ability to renew expiring drilling contracts or obtain new drilling contracts depends on the prevailing or expected market conditions at the time of expiration. As of February 12, 2021, we have 16 stacked or idle rigs and one rig under construction that has a drilling contract that is subject to a final investment decision by the customer and its partners. We also have seven existing drilling contracts for our rigs that are currently operating, which are scheduled to expire before December 31, 2021. We may be unable to obtain drilling contracts for our rigs that are currently operating upon the expiration or termination of such contracts or obtain a drilling contract for our newbuild unit with a conditional agreement in the event the conditions thereof are not satisfied, and there may be a gap in the operation of the rigs between the current contracts and subsequent contracts. When oil and natural gas prices are low or it is expected that such prices will decrease in the future, we may be unable to obtain drilling contracts at attractive dayrates or at all. We may not be able to obtain new drilling contracts in direct continuation with existing contracts or for our newbuild unit with a conditional agreement, or depending on prevailing market conditions, we may enter into drilling contracts at dayrates substantially below the existing dayrates or on terms otherwise less favorable compared to existing contract terms, which may have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur drilling contracts may be terminated due to a number of events, and, during depressed market conditions, our customers may seek to repudiate or renegotiate their contracts.\nCertain of our drilling contracts with customers may be cancelable at the option of the customer upon payment of an early termination payment. Such payments may not, however, fully compensate us for the loss of the contract. Drilling contracts also customarily provide for either automatic termination or termination at the option of the customer, typically without the payment of any termination fee, under various circumstances such as non-performance, as a result of significant downtime or impaired performance caused by equipment or operational issues, or sustained periods of downtime due to force majeure events, many of which are beyond our control. Certain customers who seek to terminate our drilling contracts may attempt to defeat or circumvent our protections against certain liabilities. Our customers\u2019 ability to perform their obligations under their drilling contracts, including their ability to fulfill their indemnity obligations to us, may also be negatively impacted by an economic downturn. Our customers, which include national oil companies, often have significant bargaining leverage over us. If our customers cancel some of our contracts, and we are unable to secure new contracts on a timely basis and on substantially similar terms, or if contracts are suspended for an extended period of time or if a number of our contracts are renegotiated on terms that are not as favorable as current terms, it could adversely affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nDuring periods of depressed market conditions, such as we are currently experiencing, we are subject to an increased counterparty risk, as our customers may seek to repudiate their contracts, including through claims of non-performance in order to reduce their capital expenditures. Our customers may no longer need a drilling rig that is currently under contract or may be able to obtain a comparable drilling rig at a lower dayrate. We have experienced, and are at continued risk of experiencing, early contract terminations in a weak commodity price environment as operators look to reduce their capital expenditures. The ability of each of our counterparties to perform its obligations under a contract with us, including indemnity obligations, will depend on a number of factors that are beyond our control and may include, among other things, general economic conditions, the condition of the offshore drilling industry, prevailing prices for oil and natural gas, the overall financial condition of the counterparty, the dayrates received and the level of expenditures necessary to maintain drilling activities. Should a counterparty fail to honor its obligations under an agreement with us, we could sustain losses, which could have an adverse effect on our business and on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe must make substantial capital and operating expenditures to maintain our active fleet or to reactivate our stacked or idle fleet, and we may be required to make significant capital expenditures to maintain our competitiveness, to execute our growth plan and to comply with laws and applicable regulations and standards of governmental authorities and organizations.\nWe must make substantial capital and operating expenditures to maintain our active fleet or to reactivate our stacked or idle fleet. These expenditures could increase as a result of changes in the cost of labor and materials, requirements of customers, the size of our fleet, the cost of replacement parts for existing rigs, the geographic location of the rigs and the length of drilling contracts. Changes in offshore drilling technology, customer requirements for new or upgraded equipment and competition within our industry may require us to make significant capital expenditures in order to maintain our competitiveness and to execute our growth plan. Changes in governmental regulations, including environmental requirements, and changes in safety or other equipment standards, as well as compliance with standards imposed by maritime self-regulatory organizations, may cause our capital expenditures to increase or require us to make additional unforeseen capital expenditures. As a result of these factors, we may be required to take our rigs out of service for extended periods of time, with corresponding losses of revenues, in order to make such alterations or to add such equipment. In the future, market conditions may not justify these expenditures or enable us to operate our older rigs profitably during the remainder of their economic lives.\n- 10 -\nIf we are unable to fund capital expenditures with our cash flows from operations or proceeds from sales of non-strategic assets, we may be required to either incur additional borrowings or raise capital through the sale of debt or equity securities, or additional financing arrangements with banks or other capital providers. Our ability to access the capital markets may be limited by our financial condition at the time, perceptions of us or our industry, by changes in laws and regulations or interpretation thereof and by adverse market conditions resulting from, among other things, general economic conditions and contingencies and uncertainties that are beyond our control. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities or other securities that are convertible into equity securities, existing shareholders may experience dilution. Our failure to obtain the funds for necessary future capital expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our business and on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nPublic health threats, such as COVID-19, have had, and may continue to have, significant adverse consequences for general economic, financial and business conditions, as well as for our business and operations.\nPublic health threats, pandemics and epidemics, such as the outbreak of a novel strain of COVID-19, severe influenza, other coronaviruses and other highly communicable viruses or diseases, have impacted and may continue to impact our operations directly or indirectly, including by disrupting the operations of our business partners, suppliers and customers in ways that adversely impact our operations. For instance, the outbreak of COVID-19 and its development into a pandemic in March 2020 resulted in various actions by governmental authorities around the world to prevent or reduce the spread of COVID-19, such as imposing mandatory closures of all non-essential business facilities, seeking voluntary closures of such facilities and imposing restrictions on, or advisories with respect to, travel, business operations and public gatherings or interactions. In addition, companies and individuals seeking to curtail the spread of COVID-19 have taken certain cautionary measures, such as companies around the world requiring employees to work remotely, suspending all non-essential travel worldwide for employees, and discouraging employee attendance at in-person work-related meetings, as well as individuals voluntarily social distancing and self-quarantining. While many of these restrictions and measures have since been softened or lifted in varying degrees in different locations around the world, and there have been several COVID-19 vaccines recently approved by many governments that are expected to accelerate a recovery from the pandemic, the ultimate success of such vaccines is currently uncertain and resurgences in the spread of COVID-19 and other rapid developments with respect to the virus have prompted and may in the future prompt, the re-imposition of certain restrictions and measures.\nThese responses have significantly reduced global economic activity, as there has been a dramatic decrease in the number of businesses open for operation and a substantial reduction in the number of people across the world that have been going to work or leaving their house to purchase goods and services. This has also resulted in airlines dramatically cutting back on flights and has reduced the number of cars on the road. As a result, there has also been a sharp reduction in the demand for oil and a decline in oil prices.\nWe have taken similar precautionary measures intended to help minimize the risk to our business, employees, customers, suppliers and the communities in which we operate. Our operational employees generally are currently still able to work on site and on our rigs. We have taken comprehensive and global precautionary measures with respect to such operational employees, such as requiring them to verify they have not either experienced any symptoms consistent with COVID-19 or been in close contact with someone showing such symptoms before they are permitted to travel to the work site or rig, quarantining any operational employee on a rig who has shown signs of COVID-19, regardless of whether such employee has been confirmed to be infected, and imposing social distancing requirements in certain areas of the rig, such as in the dining hall and sleeping quarters, and are incurring incremental costs. We are also actively assessing and planning for various operational contingencies; however, we cannot guarantee that any actions taken by us, including the precautionary measures noted above, will be effective in preventing either an outbreak of COVID-19 on one or more of our rigs or other adverse effects related to COVID-19. To the extent an outbreak of COVID-19 develops on one or more of our rigs, we may have to temporarily shut down operations of such rig or rigs, which could result in significant downtime or contract termination and have substantial adverse consequences for our business and results of operations. In addition, most of our non-operational employees are now working remotely, which increases various operational risks. For instance, working remotely may increase the risk of security breaches or other cyber incidents or attacks, loss of data, fraud and other disruptions as a consequence of more employees accessing sensitive and critical information from remote locations.\nMany governmental authorities across the globe have implemented travel restrictions and mandatory quarantine measures to prevent or reduce the spread of COVID-19, and in complying with such governmental actions, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, increased difficulties, delays and costs in moving our personnel in and out of, and to work in, the various jurisdictions in which we operate. We may be unable to pass along these increased costs to our customers. Additionally, disruptions to or restrictions on the ability of our suppliers, manufacturers and service providers to supply parts, equipment or services in the jurisdictions in which we operate or to progress the construction of our newbuild projects, whether as a result of government actions, labor shortages, the inability to source parts or equipment from affected locations, or other effects related to the COVID-19 outbreak, may have significant adverse consequences on our ability to meet our commitments to customers, including by increasing our operating costs and increasing the risk of rig downtime and could result in contract terminations.\nConcerns over the prolonged negative effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on economic and business prospects across the world have also contributed to increased market and oil price volatility and have diminished expectations for the performance of the global economy. These factors, coupled with the prospect of decreased business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak and the decline in, and steep increase in the volatility of, oil prices, have precipitated an economic downturn and likely a recession. The current downturn and period of depressed oil prices has had and may continue to have significant adverse consequences\n- 11 -\nfor the financial condition of our customers or suppliers. Such conditions have resulted in, and may continue to result in, reductions to our customers\u2019 drilling and production expenditures and delays or cancellations of projects, thus decreasing demand for our services, and an increased risk that our customers may seek price reductions or more favorable economic terms for our services, terminate our contracts or that we may be required to idle, stack or retire more of our rigs. Additionally, any early termination payment made in connection with an early contract termination may not fully compensate us for the loss of the contract. Accordingly, the actual amount of revenues earned may be substantially lower than the reported contract backlog. To the extent our suppliers experience a deterioration in financial condition or operational capability as a result of such depressed market and industry conditions or we or other suppliers incur delays in moving personnel to and from drilling rigs, we may experience disruptions in supply, which could increase our operating costs and increase rig downtime. The occurrence of any such events with respect to our customers, contracts or suppliers in certain cases has had, and may continue to have, significant adverse consequences for our business and financial position.\nThe magnitude and duration of potential social, economic and labor instability resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak, including how quickly national economies can recover once the pandemic subsides, or whether any recovery will ultimately experience a reversal or other setbacks, are uncertain and cannot be estimated at this time as such effects depend on future events that are largely out of our control. The ultimate extent of the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on our business and financial position will depend largely on future developments, including the duration, spread or containment of the outbreak, particularly within the geographic locations where we operate, and the related impact on overall economic activity, all of which are highly uncertain at this time. We are unable to predict the timing or impact of any such restructurings, if completed, on the capital structure and competitive dynamics among offshore drilling companies.\nPublic and investor sentiment towards climate change, fossil fuels and other esg matters could adversely affect our business, cost of capital and the price of our stock and other securities.\nThere have been efforts in recent years, based on changing public sentiment concerning fossil fuels, aimed at the investment community, including investment advisors, sovereign wealth funds, public pension funds, universities and other groups, to promote the divestment of shares of energy companies, as well as to pressure lenders and other financial services companies to limit or curtail activities with energy companies. These efforts have intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic, as seen by the State of New York\u2019s December 2020 announcement that it will be divesting the state\u2019s Common Retirement Fund from fossil fuels. If this or similar divestment efforts are successful, our stock price and our ability to access capital markets may be negatively impacted.\nMembers of the investment community are also increasing their focus on environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) practices and disclosures, including practices and disclosures related to greenhouse gases and climate change, in the energy industry in particular, and diversity and inclusion initiatives and governance standards among public companies more generally. As a result, we may face increasing pressure regarding our ESG disclosures and practices. Additionally, members of the investment community may screen companies such as ours for ESG sustainability performance before investing in our stock. Over the past few years there has also been an acceleration in investor demand for ESG investing opportunities, and many large institutional investors have committed to increasing the percentage of their portfolios that are allocated towards ESG investments. As a result, there has been a proliferation of ESG focused investment funds seeking ESG oriented investment products. If we or our securities are unable to meet the sustainability ESG standards or investment criteria set by these investors and funds, we may lose investors or investors may allocate a portion of their capital away from us, our cost of capital may increase, our stock price and the price of our publicly traded debt securities may be negatively impacted and our reputation may also be negatively affected.\nWe rely heavily on a relatively small number of customers and the loss of a significant customer or a dispute that leads to the loss of a customer could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe engage in offshore drilling services for most of the leading integrated oil companies or their affiliates, as well as for many government-owned or government-controlled oil companies and other independent oil companies. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our most significant customers were Shell, Equinor and Chevron, accounting for approximately 28 percent, 27 percent and 14 percent, respectively, of our total contract drilling revenues. As of February 12, 2021, the customers with the most significant aggregate amount of contract backlog were Shell, Equinor and Chevron, representing approximately 53 percent, 23 percent and 13 percent, respectively, of our total contract backlog. The loss of any of these customers or another significant customer, or a decline in payments under any of our drilling contracts, could, at least in the short term, have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur operating and maintenance costs will not necessarily fluctuate in proportion to changes in our operating revenues.\nOur operating and maintenance costs will not necessarily fluctuate in proportion to changes in our operating revenues. Costs for operating a rig are generally fixed or only semi-variable regardless of the dayrate being earned. In addition, should our rigs incur unplanned downtime while on contract or idle time between drilling contracts, we will not always reduce the staff on those rigs because we could use the crew to prepare the rig for its next contract. During times of reduced activity, reductions in costs may not be immediate because portions of the crew may be required to prepare rigs for stacking, after which time the crew members may be reassigned to active rigs or released. As our rigs are mobilized from one geographic location to another, the labor and other operating and maintenance costs can vary significantly. In general, labor costs increase primarily due to higher salary levels and inflation. Equipment maintenance costs fluctuate depending upon the type of activity the unit is performing and the age and condition of the equipment, and these costs could increase for short or extended periods as a result of regulatory or customer requirements that raise maintenance standards above historical levels. The amount of contract\n- 12 -\npreparation and reactivation costs vary based on the scope and length of the contract preparation or reactivation project, and the recognition of such costs varies depending on the duration of the firm contractual period and other contract terms.\nCertain of our drilling contracts are partially payable in local currency. The amounts, if any, of local currency received under these drilling contracts may exceed our local currency needs to pay local operating and maintenance costs, leading to an accumulation of excess local currency balances, which, in certain instances, may be subject to either restrictions or other difficulties in converting to U.S. dollars, our functional currency, or to other currencies of the locations where we operate. Excess amounts of local currency may also be exposed to the risk of currency exchange losses.\nOur business involves numerous operating hazards, and our insurance and indemnities from our customers may not be adequate to cover potential losses from our operations.\nOur operations are subject to the usual hazards inherent in the drilling of oil and gas wells, such as, blowouts, reservoir damage, loss of production, loss of well control, lost or stuck drill strings, equipment defects, craterings, fires, explosions and pollution. Contract drilling requires the use of heavy equipment and exposure to hazardous conditions, which may subject us to liability claims by employees, customers and other parties. These hazards can cause personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental or natural resource damage, claims by third parties or customers and suspension of operations. Our offshore fleet is also subject to hazards inherent in marine operations, either while on site or during mobilization, such as capsizing, sinking, grounding, collision, piracy, damage from severe weather and marine life infestations.\nThe South China Sea, the Northwest Coast of Australia and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico are areas subject to typhoons, hurricanes or other extreme weather conditions on a relatively frequent basis, and our drilling rigs in these regions may be exposed to damage or total loss by these storms, some of which may not be covered by insurance. The occurrence of these events could result in the suspension of drilling operations, damage to or destruction of the equipment involved and injury to or death of rig personnel. Some experts believe global climate change could increase the frequency and severity of these extreme weather conditions. Operations may also be suspended because of machinery breakdowns, abnormal drilling conditions, failure of subcontractors to perform or supply goods or services, or personnel shortages. We customarily provide contract indemnity to our customers for certain claims that could be asserted by us relating to damage to or loss of our equipment, including rigs, and claims that could be asserted by us or our employees relating to personal injury or loss of life.\nDamage to the environment or natural resources could also result from our operations, particularly through spillage of hydrocarbons, fuel, lubricants or other chemicals and substances used in drilling operations, or extensive uncontrolled fires. We may also be subject to property damage, environmental indemnity and other claims by oil and natural gas companies or other third parties. Drilling involves certain risks associated with the loss of control of a well, such as blowout, cratering, the cost to regain control of or redrill the well and remediation of associated pollution. Our customers may be unable or unwilling to indemnify us against such risks. In addition, a court may decide that certain indemnities in our current or future drilling contracts are not enforceable. The law generally considers contractual indemnity for criminal fines and penalties to be against public policy, and the enforceability of an indemnity as to other matters may be limited.\nOur insurance policies and drilling contracts contain rights to indemnity that may not adequately cover our losses, and we do not have insurance coverage or rights to indemnity for all risks. We have two main types of insurance coverage: (1) hull and machinery coverage for physical damage to our property and equipment and (2) excess liability coverage, which generally covers offshore risks, such as personal injury, third-party property claims, and third-party non-crew claims, including wreck removal and pollution. We generally have no hull and machinery insurance coverage for damages caused by named storms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. We maintain per occurrence deductibles that generally range up to $10 million for various third-party liabilities, and we self-insure $50 million of the $750 million excess liability coverage through our wholly owned captive insurance company. We also retain the risk for any liability that exceeds our excess liability coverage. However, pollution and environmental risks generally are not completely insurable.\nIf a significant accident or other event occurs that is not fully covered by our insurance or by an enforceable or recoverable indemnity, the occurrence could adversely affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The amount of our insurance may also be less than the related impact on enterprise value after a loss. Our insurance coverage will not in all situations provide sufficient funds to protect us from all liabilities that could result from our drilling operations. Our coverage includes annual aggregate policy limits. As a result, we generally retain the risk for any losses in excess of these limits. We generally do not carry insurance for loss of revenue, and certain other claims may also not be reimbursed by insurance carriers. Any such lack of reimbursement may cause us to incur substantial costs. In addition, we could decide to retain more risk in the future, resulting in higher risk of losses, which could be material. Moreover, we may not be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable or be able to obtain insurance against certain risks.\nFailure to recruit and retain key personnel could hurt our operations.\nWe depend on the continuing efforts of key members of our management, as well as other highly skilled personnel, to operate and provide technical services and support for our business worldwide. Historically, competition for the personnel required for drilling operations has intensified as the number of rigs activated, added to worldwide fleets or under construction increased, leading to shortages of qualified personnel in the industry and creating upward pressure on wages and higher turnover. We may experience a reduction in the experience level of our personnel as a result of any increased turnover and ongoing staff reduction initiatives, which could lead to higher downtime and\n- 13 -\nmore operating incidents, which in turn could decrease revenues and increase costs. If increased competition for qualified personnel were to intensify in the future we may experience increases in costs or limits on operations.\nOur labor costs and the operating restrictions under which we operate could increase as a result of collective bargaining negotiations and additional unionization efforts.\nApproximately 43 percent of our total workforce, primarily employed in Norway, Brazil and the U.K., are represented by, and some of our contracted labor work is subject to, collective bargaining agreements, substantially all of which are subject to annual salary negotiation. Negotiations over annual salary or other labor matters could result in higher personnel or other costs or increased operational restrictions or disruptions. The outcome of any such negotiation generally affects the market for all offshore employees, not only the union members. Furthermore, a failure to reach an agreement on certain key issues could result in strikes, lockouts, or other work stoppages. Legislation has been introduced in the U.S. Congress that could encourage additional unionization efforts in the U.S., as well as increase the chances that such efforts succeed. Additional unionization efforts, if successful, new collective bargaining agreements or work stoppages could materially increase our labor costs and operating restrictions.\nOur shipyard projects and operations are subject to delays and cost overruns.\nAs of February 12, 2021, we had under construction two ultra-deepwater drillships. We also have a variety of other more limited shipyard projects at any given time. These shipyard projects are subject to the risks of delay or cost overruns inherent in any such construction project resulting from numerous factors, including the following:\n\u25fe complications arising from pandemics and epidemics, such as the outbreak of a novel strain of COVID-19, severe influenza, other coronaviruses and other highly communicable viruses or diseases and associated government orders in the country where the rigs are being constructed or serviced and elsewhere;\n\u25fe shipyard availability, failures and difficulties;\n\u25fe shortages of equipment, materials or skilled labor;\n\u25fe design and engineering problems, including those relating to the commissioning of newly designed equipment;\n\u25fe latent damages or deterioration to hull, equipment and machinery in excess of engineering estimates and assumptions;\n\u25fe unanticipated actual or purported change orders;\n\u25fe disputes with shipyards and suppliers;\n\u25fe failure or delayed deliveries of significant materials or equipment for various reasons, including due to supplier shortages, constraints, disruption or quality issues;\n\u25fe availability of suppliers to recertify equipment for enhanced regulations;\n\u25fe strikes, labor disputes and work stoppages;\n\u25fe customer acceptance delays;\n\u25fe customer delays in providing customer-supplied engineering, approvals or equipment;\n\u25fe adverse weather conditions, including damage caused by such conditions;\n\u25fe terrorist acts, war, piracy and civil unrest;\n\u25fe unanticipated cost increases; and\n\u25fe difficulty in obtaining necessary permits or approvals.\nThese factors may contribute to cost variations and delays in the delivery of our newbuild units and other rigs undergoing shipyard projects. Cost variations may result in, among other things, disputes with the shipyards that construct or service our drilling units. In addition, delayed delivery of our newbuild units or other rigs undergoing shipyard projects would impact contract commencement, resulting in a loss of revenues we could earn, and may also cause customers to terminate or shorten the term of the drilling contract for the rig pursuant to applicable late delivery clauses. In the event of termination of any of these drilling contracts, we may not be able to secure a replacement contract on as favorable terms, if at all.\nOur operations also rely on a significant supply of capital and consumable spare parts and equipment to maintain and repair our fleet. We also rely on the supply of ancillary services, including supply boats and helicopters. Our reliance on our suppliers, manufacturers and service providers to secure equipment, parts, components and sub-systems used in our operations exposes us to volatility in the quality, prices and availability of such items. Certain parts and equipment that we use in our operations may be available only from a small number of suppliers, manufacturers or service providers, or in some cases must be sourced through a single supplier, manufacturer or service provider. A disruption in the deliveries from our suppliers, manufacturers or service providers, capacity constraints, production disruptions, price increases, quality control issues, recalls or other decreased availability of parts and equipment or ancillary services could adversely affect our ability to meet our commitments to customers, adversely impact our operations, increase our operating costs and result in increases in rig downtime and delays in the repair and maintenance of our fleet.\nRisks related to our indebtedness\nWe have a substantial amount of debt, including secured debt, and we may lose the ability to obtain future financing and suffer competitive disadvantages.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, our total debt was $7.8 billion and $9.3 billion, respectively, of which $2.8 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively, was secured. We have a bank credit agreement, as amended, that established a $1.3 billion secured revolving credit facility\n- 14 -\n(the \u201cSecured Credit Facility\u201d), which is currently undrawn, the borrowings under which would be secured. This substantial level of debt and other obligations could have significant adverse consequences on our business and future prospects, including the following:\n\u25fe we may be unable to obtain financing in the future to refinance our existing debt or for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, distributions, share repurchases, or other purposes;\n\u25fe we may be unable to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to service the debt;\n\u25fe we could become more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including increases in interest rates, particularly given our substantial indebtedness, some of which bears interest at variable rates;\n\u25fe we may be unable to meet financial ratios in the agreements governing certain of our debt and finance lease or satisfy certain other covenants and conditions included in our debt agreements, which could result in our inability to meet requirements for borrowings under our credit agreement or a default under these agreements, impose restrictions with respect to our access to certain of our capital, and trigger cross default provisions in our other debt instruments;\n\u25fe if we default under the terms of our secured financing arrangements, the secured debtholders may, among other things, foreclose on the collateral securing the debt, including the applicable drilling units;\n\u25fe we may be unable to obtain new investment or financing given recent environmental, social and governance influenced trends among many financial intermediaries, investors and other capital markets participants in reducing, or ceasing, lending to, or investing in, companies that operate in industries with higher perceived environmental exposure; and\n\u25fe we may be less able to take advantage of significant business opportunities and to react to changes in market or industry conditions than our less levered competitors.\nSee \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Sources and uses of liquidity.\u201d\nCredit rating agencies have rated our debt below investment grade, which could limit our access to capital and have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nThe ratings assigned to our debt securities by credit agencies (our \u201cDebt Rating\u201d) are below investment grade. Our Debt Ratings could have adverse consequences for our business and future prospects and could cause the following:\n\u25fe limitations on our ability to access debt markets, including for the purpose of refinancing our existing debt, replacing or extending our Secured Credit Facility;\n\u25fe less favorable terms and conditions on any refinancing arrangements, debt issuances or bank credit agreements, some of which could require collateral and restrict, among other things, our ability to pay distributions or repurchase shares;\n\u25fe increases to certain fees under our Secured Credit Facility and interest rates under indentures governing certain of our senior notes, which in the case of the 6.375% senior notes due December 2021, the 3.80% senior notes due October 2022, and the 7.375% senior notes due December 2041, have already reached the maximum rate increase of 2 percent pursuant to the related indenture due to the downgrades of certain rating agencies;\n\u25fe reduced willingness of current and prospective customers, suppliers and creditors to transact business with us;\n\u25fe requirements from creditors, suppliers or customers for additional insurance, guarantees and collateral;\n\u25fe limitations on our access to bank and third-party guarantees, surety bonds and letters of credit; and\n\u25fe reductions to or eliminations of the level of credit suppliers and financial institutions may provide through payment terms or intraday funding when dealing with us thereby increasing the need for higher levels of cash on hand, which would decrease our ability to repay debt balances.\nOur Debt Ratings have caused some of the effects listed above, and any further downgrades may cause or exacerbate, any of the effects listed above and could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWorldwide financial, economic and political conditions could restrict our ability to access the capital markets, reduce our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions and reduce demand for our services.\nWorldwide financial and economic conditions could restrict our ability to access the capital markets at a time when we would like, or need, to access such markets, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. Worldwide economic conditions have in the past impacted, and could in the future impact, the lenders participating in our credit facilities and our customers, causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us. If economic conditions preclude or limit financing from banking institutions participating in our credit facilities, we may not be able to obtain similar financing from other institutions. A slowdown in economic activity could further reduce worldwide demand for energy and extend or worsen the recovery from low oil and natural gas prices. These potential developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, turmoil and hostilities in the Middle East, North Africa and other geographic areas and countries present incremental risk. An extended period of negative outlook for the world economy could further reduce the overall demand for oil and natural gas and for our services. A further decline in oil and natural gas prices or an extension of the current low oil and natural gas prices could reduce demand for our drilling services and have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n- 15 -\nRisks related to laws, regulations and governmental compliance\nImpact of increasingly stringent environmental and safety laws and our compliance with or breach of such laws can be costly, expose us to liability and could limit our operations.\nOur business is affected by laws and regulations relating to the energy industry and the environment and safety, including international conventions and treaties, and regional, national, state, and local laws and regulations. Our business also depends on demand for services from the oil and gas exploration and production industry, and, accordingly, we are directly affected by the adoption of laws and regulations that, for economic, environmental or other policy reasons, curtail, delay or impose additional compliance costs and obligations related to the exploration and development drilling for oil and gas. Offshore drilling in certain areas has been curtailed and, in certain cases, prohibited because of environmental or safety concerns. In addition, compliance with environmental and safety laws, regulations and standards, where applicable, may require us to make significant capital expenditures, such as the installation of costly equipment or implementation of operational changes, and may affect the resale values or useful lives of our rigs. We may also incur additional costs in order to comply with other existing and future regulatory obligations or industry standards, including, but not limited to, costs relating to air emissions, including greenhouse gases, the management of ballast waters, maintenance and inspection, development and implementation of emergency procedures and maintenance of insurance coverage or other financial assurance of our ability to address pollution incidents. For instance, in the last decade, enhanced governmental safety and environmental requirements applicable to our operations were adopted by U.S. federal agencies for drilling in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico have caused, and may in the future cause, operators to have difficulties obtaining drilling permits in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. In addition, the oil and gas industry has adopted new equipment and operating standards, such as the American Petroleum Institute Standard 53, related to the installation and testing of well control equipment. A failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may result in administrative and civil penalties, criminal sanctions or the suspension or termination of our operations. Additionally, our customers may elect to voluntarily comply with any non-mandatory laws, regulations or other standards.\nAny such safety, environmental and other regulatory restrictions or standards, including voluntary customer compliance with respect thereto, could decrease, disrupt or delay operations, decrease demand for offshore drilling services, increase operating costs and compliance costs or penalties, increase out-of-service time, decrease dayrates, or reduce the area of operations for drilling rigs in the U.S. and non-U.S. offshore areas. Any such effects could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nTo the extent new laws are enacted, existing laws are changed or other governmental actions are taken that prohibit or restrict offshore drilling or impose additional environmental protection and safety requirements that result in increased costs to the oil and gas industry, in general, or the offshore drilling industry, in particular, our business or prospects could be materially adversely affected. The operation of our drilling rigs will require certain governmental approvals, some of which may involve public hearings and costly undertakings on our part. We may not obtain such approvals or such approvals may not be obtained in a timely manner. If we fail to timely secure the necessary governmental approvals or permits, our customers may have the right to terminate or seek to renegotiate their drilling contracts to our detriment. The amendment or modification of existing laws and regulations or the adoption of new laws and regulations curtailing or further regulating exploratory or development drilling or production of oil and gas and compliance with any such new or amended legislation or regulations could have an adverse effect on our business or on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nAs a contract driller with operations in certain offshore areas, we may be liable for damages and costs incurred in connection with oil spills or disposal of wastes related to those operations, and we may also be subject to significant fines and other liabilities in connection with spills. For example, an oil spill could result in significant liability, including fines, penalties and criminal liability and remediation, restoration or compensation costs for environmental or natural resource damages, as well as third-party damages, to the extent that the contractual indemnification provisions in our drilling contracts are not enforceable or otherwise sufficient, or if our customers are unwilling or unable to contractually indemnify us against these risks. Additionally, we may not be able to obtain such indemnities in our future drilling contracts, and our customers may not have the financial capability to fulfill their contractual obligations to us. Also, these indemnities may be held to be unenforceable in certain jurisdictions, as a result of public policy or for other reasons. Environmental and safety laws and regulations protecting the environment have become increasingly stringent and may in some cases impose strict liability on facility or vessel owners or operators, rendering a person liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence. These laws and regulations may expose us to liability for the conduct of, or conditions caused by, others or for acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time they were performed. The application of these requirements or the adoption of new requirements or measures could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nRegulatory and various other risks, including litigation, associated with greenhouse gases and climate change could have an adverse impact on our business and demand for our services.\nScientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases, including greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, contribute to warming of the earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climatic changes. In response to such studies, the issue of climate change and the effect of greenhouse gas emissions, in particular emissions from the fossil fuel industry, has attracted considerable attention worldwide. The attention to climate change has led, and we expect it to continue to lead, to additional regulations designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions domestically and internationally. Such attention could also result in other adverse impacts for the oil and gas industry, including further restrictions or bans imposed by lawmakers, lawsuits by governments or third-parties seeking recoveries for damages resulting from the combustion of fuels that may contribute to climate change effects, or reduced interest from investors if they elect\n- 16 -\nin the future to shift some or all of their investments to non-fossil fuel related sectors. To the extent financial markets view climate change and greenhouse emissions as a financial risk, this could negatively impact our cost of or access to capital. Because our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and gas industry, existing or future laws, regulations, treaties or international agreements related to greenhouse gases and climate change, or related political, litigation or financial risks, including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources, could have a negative impact on our business if such laws, regulations, treaties or international agreements reduce the worldwide demand for oil and gas or limit drilling opportunities. In addition, such laws, regulations, treaties or international agreements or related risks could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, which may have an adverse effect on our business. Further, some experts believe global climate change could increase the frequency and severity of extreme weather conditions, the impacts of which could interfere with our operations, cause damage to our equipment as well as cause other financial and operational impacts, including those that could result from any impact of such conditions on our customers.\nWe could also face increased climate-related litigation with respect to our operations both in the U.S. and around the world. Governmental and other entities in various U.S. states, such as California and New York, have filed lawsuits against coal, gas oil and petroleum companies. These suits allege damages as a result of climate change, and the plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and abatement under various tort theories. Similar lawsuits may be filed in other jurisdictions both in the U.S. and globally. Though we are not currently a party to any such lawsuit, these suits present a high degree of uncertainty regarding the extent to which energy companies, including offshore drillers, face an increased risk of liability stemming from climate change, which risk would also adversely impact the oil and gas industry and impact demand for our services.\nThe global nature of our operations involves additional risks.\nWe operate in various regions throughout the world, which may expose us to political and other uncertainties, including risks of:\n\u25fe terrorist acts, war, piracy and civil unrest;\n\u25fe seizure, expropriation or nationalization of our equipment;\n\u25fe expropriation or nationalization of our customers\u2019 property;\n\u25fe repudiation or nationalization of contracts;\n\u25fe imposition of trade or immigration barriers;\n\u25fe import-export quotas;\n\u25fe wage and price controls;\n\u25fe changes in law and regulatory requirements, including changes in interpretation and enforcement;\n\u25fe involvement in judicial proceedings in unfavorable jurisdictions;\n\u25fe damage to our equipment or violence directed at our employees, including kidnappings;\n\u25fe complications associated with supplying, repairing and replacing equipment in remote locations;\n\u25fe the inability to move income or capital; and\n\u25fe currency exchange fluctuations and currency exchange restrictions, including exchange or similar controls that may limit our ability to convert local currency into U.S. dollars and transfer funds out of a local jurisdiction.\nOur non-U.S. contract drilling operations are subject to various laws and regulations in certain countries in which we operate, including laws and regulations relating to the import and export, equipment and operation of drilling units, currency conversions and repatriation, oil and gas exploration and development, taxation and social contributions of offshore earnings and earnings of expatriate personnel. We are also subject to the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d) and other U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations governing our international operations. In addition, various state and municipal governments, universities and other investors have proposed or adopted divestment and other initiatives regarding investments including, with respect to state governments, by state retirement systems in companies that do business with countries that have been designated as state sponsors of terrorism by the U.S. State Department. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including those relating to sanctions and export restrictions, may subject us to criminal sanctions or civil remedies, including fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions or seizures of assets. Investors could view any potential violations of OFAC regulations negatively, which could adversely affect our reputation and the market for our shares.\nGovernments in some countries have become increasingly active in regulating and controlling the ownership of concessions and companies holding concessions, the exploration for oil and gas and other aspects of the oil and gas industries in their countries, including local content requirements for participating in tenders for certain drilling contracts. Many governments favor or effectively require the awarding of drilling contracts to local contractors or require nonlocal contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction or require use of a local agent. In addition, government action, including initiatives by OPEC, may continue to cause oil or gas price volatility. In some areas of the world, this governmental activity has adversely affected the amount of exploration and development work by major oil companies and may continue to do so.\nThe shipment of goods, services and technology across international borders subjects us to extensive trade laws and regulations. Our import and export activities are governed by unique customs laws and regulations in each of the countries where we operate. Moreover, many countries, including the U.S., control the import and export of certain goods, services and technology and impose related import and export recordkeeping and reporting obligations. Governments also may impose economic sanctions against certain countries, persons and other entities that may restrict or prohibit transactions involving such countries, persons and entities, and we are also subject to the U.S. anti-boycott law.\n- 17 -\nThe laws and regulations concerning import and export activity, recordkeeping and reporting, import and export control and economic sanctions are complex and constantly changing. These laws and regulations may be enacted, amended, enforced or interpreted in a manner materially impacting our operations. Ongoing economic challenges may increase some governments\u2019 efforts to enact, enforce, amend or interpret laws and regulations as a method to increase revenue. Shipments can be delayed and denied import or export for a variety of reasons, some of which are outside our control and some of which may result from failure to comply with existing legal and regulatory regimes. Shipping delays or denials could cause unscheduled operational downtime.\nOur ability to operate worldwide depends on our ability to obtain the necessary visas and work permits for our personnel to travel in and out of, and to work in, the jurisdictions in which we operate. Governmental actions in some of the jurisdictions in which we operate may make it difficult for us to move our personnel in and out of these jurisdictions by delaying or withholding the approval of these permits. If we are not able to obtain visas and work permits for the employees we need to conduct our operations on a timely basis, we might not be able to perform our obligations under our drilling contracts, which could allow our customers to cancel the contracts. If our customers cancel some of our drilling contracts, and we are unable to secure new drilling contracts on a timely basis and on substantially similar terms, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nFailure to comply with anti-bribery statutes, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, could result in fines, criminal penalties, drilling contract terminations and an adverse effect on our business.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 (\u201cBribery Act\u201d) and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions, generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. If we are found to be liable for violations under the FCPA, the Bribery Act or other similar laws, either due to our acts or omissions or due to the acts or omissions of others, including our partners in our various joint ventures and of the current or former officers, directors or employees of any companies we have acquired, we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or our consolidated financial position and results of operations. In addition, investors could negatively view potential violations, inquiries or allegations of misconduct under the FCPA, the Bribery Act or similar laws, which could adversely affect our reputation and the market for our shares.\nWe could also face fines, sanctions and other penalties from authorities in relevant jurisdictions, including prohibition of our participating in or curtailment of business operations in those jurisdictions and the seizure of rigs or other assets. Additionally, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of claims by customers, agents, shareholders, debt holders, other interest holders, current or former employees or other constituents of our company who, in connection with alleged or actual noncompliance with antibribery and related laws, may seek to impose penalties, seek remedies, terminate drilling contracts or take other actions adverse to our interests. Our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if we are required to dedicate significant time and resources to investigate and resolve allegations of misconduct, regardless of the merit of such allegations. Further, disclosure of the subject matter of any investigation could adversely affect our reputation and our ability to obtain new business with potential customers, to retain existing business with our current customers, to attract and retain employees and to access the capital markets.\nWe are subject to investigations and litigation that, if not resolved in our favor and not sufficiently insured against, could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are subject to a variety of disputes, investigations and litigation. Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to and have been involved in litigation with certain of our customers and other constituents. Certain of our subsidiaries are named as defendants in numerous lawsuits alleging personal grievances or injury, including as a result of exposure to asbestos or toxic fumes or resulting from other occupational diseases, such as silicosis, and various other medical issues that can remain undiscovered for a considerable amount of time. Some of these subsidiaries that have been put on notice of potential liabilities have no assets. Certain subsidiaries are subject to litigation relating to environmental damage. Our patent for dual-activity technology has been successfully challenged in certain jurisdictions. We are also subject to a number of significant tax disputes. We cannot predict the outcome of the investigations and cases involving the Company or our subsidiaries or the potential costs to resolve them. Insurance may not be applicable or sufficient in all cases, insurers may not remain solvent and policies may not be located. Suits against non-asset-owning subsidiaries have and may in the future give rise to alter ego or successor-in-interest claims against us and our asset-owning subsidiaries to the extent a subsidiary is unable to pay a claim or insurance is not available or sufficient to cover the claims. To the extent that one or more pending or future investigations or litigation matters is not resolved in our favor and is not covered by insurance, which could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe are subject to cybersecurity risks and threats as well as increasing regulation of data privacy and security.\nWe depend on data and digital technologies to conduct our offshore and onshore operations, to collect payments from customers and to pay vendors and employees. Our data protection measures and measures taken by our customers and vendors may not prevent unauthorized access of information technology systems. Threats to our information technology systems, and the systems of our customers and vendors, associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber-incidents or attacks continue to grow. Threats to our systems and our customers\u2019 and vendors\u2019 systems may derive from human error, fraud or malice, social engineering on the part of employees or third parties, or may\n- 18 -\nresult from accidental technological failure. In addition, breaches to our systems and systems of our customers and vendors could go unnoticed for some period of time. Risks associated with these threats include disruptions of certain systems on our rigs; other impairments of our ability to conduct our operations; loss or ransom of intellectual property, proprietary information or customer and vendor data; disruption of our customers\u2019 and vendors\u2019 operations; misappropriation of assets; loss or damage to our customer and vendor data delivery systems; and increased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events. A breach could also originate from, or compromise, our customers\u2019 and vendors\u2019 or other third-party networks outside of our control. A breach may also result in legal claims or proceedings against us by our shareholders, employees, customers, vendors and governmental authorities, both U.S. and non-U.S. If such a cyber-incident were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business or on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn addition, laws and regulations governing data privacy and the unauthorized disclosure of personal data and confidential information, including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, the Data Protection Law, as revised, of the Cayman Islands, the General Data Protection Law of Brazil and the California Consumer Privacy Act, pose increasingly complex compliance challenges and potential to elevate our costs. Any failure by us to comply with these laws and regulations, including as a result of a security or privacy breach, could result in significant penalties, litigation and liabilities for us. Additionally, if we acquire a company that has violated or is not in compliance with applicable data protection laws, we may incur significant liabilities and penalties as a result.\nActs of terrorism, piracy and political and social unrest could affect the markets for drilling services.\nActs of terrorism and social unrest, brought about by world political events or otherwise, have caused instability in the world\u2019s financial and insurance markets in the past and may occur in the future. Such acts could be directed against companies such as ours. In addition, acts of terrorism, piracy and social unrest could lead to increased volatility in prices for crude oil and natural gas and could affect the markets for drilling services. Insurance premiums could increase and coverage may be unavailable in the future. Government regulations may effectively preclude us from engaging in business activities in certain countries. These regulations could be amended to cover countries where we currently operate or where we may wish to operate in the future. Our drilling contracts do not generally provide indemnification against loss of capital assets or loss of revenues resulting from acts of terrorism, piracy or political or social unrest. We have limited insurance for our assets providing coverage for physical damage losses resulting from certain risks, such as terrorist acts, piracy, vandalism, sabotage, civil unrest, expropriation and acts of war, and we do not carry insurance for loss of revenues resulting from such risks.\nRisks related to taxes\nA change in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation, of any country in which we have operations, are incorporated or are resident could result in a higher effective tax rate on our consolidated earnings and increase our cash tax payments.\nWe are subject to changes in applicable tax laws, treaties or regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate and earn income, and such changes could include laws or policies directed toward companies organized in jurisdictions with low tax rates with the intent to increase the tax burden. Switzerland, for example, enacted tax reform in response to certain guidance from and demands by the EU and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (the \u201cOECD\u201d) effective January 2022. Similarly, the OECD issued its action plan of tax reform measures that called for member states to take action to prevent base erosion and profit shifting. Some of these measures impact transfer pricing, requirements to qualify for tax treaty benefits, and the definition of permanent establishments depending on each jurisdiction\u2019s adoption and interpretation of such proposals. Respective countries have adopted various measures into their own tax laws. In addition, the EU issued its Anti-Tax Avoidance Directives in 2016 and 2017 that required its member states to adopt specific tax reform measures starting in 2019. Other tax jurisdictions in which we operate may consider implementing similar legislation. Any material change to tax laws, treaties, regulations or policies, their interpretation or application, or the adoption of new interpretations of existing laws and rulings, in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate, are incorporated or resident, could result in a higher effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings and such change could have a significant adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nA loss of a major tax dispute or a successful tax challenge to our operating structure, intercompany pricing policies or the taxable presence of our key subsidiaries in certain countries could result in a higher effective tax rate on our consolidated earnings and increase our cash tax payments.\nWe are subject to tax laws, treaties and regulations in the countries in which we operate and earn income. Our income taxes are based on the applicable tax laws and tax rates in effect in the countries in which we operate and earn income as well as upon our operating structures in these countries. Our income tax returns are subject to review and examination in these jurisdictions, and we do not recognize the benefit of income tax positions we believe are more likely than not to be disallowed upon challenge by a tax authority. If any tax authority successfully challenges our operational structure, intercompany pricing policies or the taxable presence of our key subsidiaries in certain countries; or if the terms of certain income tax treaties are interpreted in a manner that is adverse to our structure; or if we lose a material tax dispute in any country, our effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings could increase substantially and our earnings and cash flows from operations could be materially adversely affected. For example, we believe that neither we nor our non-U.S. subsidiaries, other than those that report a U.S. trade or business or a U.S. permanent establishment, were or are engaged in a trade or business in the U.S. or, if applicable, maintained or maintain a permanent establishment in the U.S. The determination of the aforementioned, among other things, involves considerable uncertainty. If the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) were to disagree, then we could be subject to additional U.S. corporate income and branch profits taxes on the portion of our earnings effectively connected to such U.S. business or, if applicable,\n- 19 -\nattributable to such U.S. permanent establishment during the period in which this was considered to have occurred. If this occurs, our effective tax rate on worldwide earnings for that period could increase substantially, we could be subject to assessments in previously filed returns that remain open to audit and our earnings and cash flows from operations for that period could be adversely affected.\nU.S. tax authorities could treat us as a passive foreign investment company, which would have adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. shareholders.\nA foreign corporation will be treated as a passive foreign investment company (\u201cPFIC\u201d) for U.S. federal income tax purposes if either (1) at least 75 percent of its gross income for any taxable year consists of certain types of passive income or (2) at least 50 percent of the average value of the corporation's assets produce or are held for the production of those types of passive income. For purposes of these tests, passive income includes dividends, interest and gains from the sale or exchange of investment property and certain rents and royalties, but does not include income derived from performing services.\nWe believe that we have not been and will not be a PFIC with respect to any taxable year. Our income from offshore contract drilling services should be treated as services income for purposes of determining whether we are a PFIC. Accordingly, we believe that our income from our offshore contract drilling services should not constitute passive income, and the assets that we own and operate in connection with the production of that income should not constitute passive assets. There is significant legal authority supporting this position, including statutory provisions, legislative history, case law and IRS pronouncements concerning the characterization, for other tax purposes, of income derived from services where a substantial component of such income is attributable to the value of the property or equipment used in connection with providing such services. However, a prior case and an IRS pronouncement that relies on such case characterize income from time chartering of vessels as rental income rather than services income for other tax purposes. The IRS has subsequently formally announced that it does not agree with the decision in that case. Moreover, we believe that the terms of the time charters in the prior case differ in material respects from the terms of our drilling contracts with customers. However, no assurance can be given that the IRS or a court will accept our position, and there is a risk that the IRS or a court could determine that we are a PFIC.\nIf we were treated as a PFIC for any taxable year, our U.S. shareholders would face adverse U.S. tax consequences. Under the PFIC rules, unless a shareholder makes certain elections available under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which elections could themselves have adverse consequences for the shareholder, the shareholder could be required to pay U.S. federal income tax at the highest applicable income tax rates on ordinary income upon the receipt of excess distributions, as defined for U.S. tax purposes, and upon any gain from the disposition of our shares, plus interest on such amounts, as if such excess distribution or gain had been recognized ratably over the shareholder\u2019s holding period of our shares. Additionally, under applicable statutory provisions, the preferential tax rate on qualified dividend income, which applies to dividends paid to non-corporate shareholders, does not apply to dividends paid by a foreign corporation if the foreign corporation is a PFIC for the taxable year in which the dividend is paid or the preceding taxable year.\nRisks related to our jurisdiction of organization and governing documents\nAs a Swiss corporation, our flexibility may be limited with respect to certain aspects of capital management AND swift implementation of certain initiatives or strategies.\nUnder Swiss law, our shareholders may approve an authorized share capital that allows the board of directors to issue new shares without additional shareholder approval within a period of up to two years and for up to a maximum of 50 percent of a company\u2019s issued share capital. The authorized share capital approved by our shareholders at the May 2020 annual general meeting will expire on May 7, 2022. Our currently available authorized share capital is limited to approximately 29 percent of our issued share capital as of February 16, 2021. Accordingly, shareholders at our annual general meeting in May 2021 may be requested to approve a renewal and an increase in authorized share capital. Additionally, subject to certain exceptions, Swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares. Further, Swiss law does not provide as much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares as the laws of some other jurisdictions. Swiss law also reserves for shareholder approval certain corporate actions over which a board of directors would have authority in some other jurisdictions. For example, dividends must be approved by shareholders. These Swiss law requirements relating to our capital management may limit our flexibility, and situations may arise where greater flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders.\nDistributions to shareholders in the form of a par value reduction and dividend distributions out of qualifying additional paid-in capital are not currently subject to the 35 percent Swiss federal withholding tax. However, the Swiss withholding tax rules could also be changed in the future, and any such change may adversely affect us or our shareholders. In addition, over the long term, the amount of par value available for us to use for par value reductions or the amount of qualifying additional paid-in capital available for us to pay out as distributions is limited. If we are unable to make a distribution through a reduction in par value, or out of qualifying additional paid-in capital as shown on Transocean Ltd.\u2019s standalone Swiss statutory financial statements, we may not be able to make distributions without subjecting our shareholders to Swiss withholding taxes.\nUnder Swiss tax law, repurchases of shares for the purposes of capital reduction are treated as a partial liquidation subject to a 35 percent Swiss withholding tax based on the difference between the repurchase price and the related amount of par value and the related amount of qualifying additional paid-in capital, if any. At our 2009 annual general meeting, our shareholders approved the repurchase of up to CHF 3.5 billion of our shares for cancellation under the share repurchase program. If we repurchase shares, we expect to use an alternative procedure pursuant to which we repurchase shares via a \u201cvirtual second trading line\u201d from market players, such as banks and\n- 20 -\ninstitutional investors, who are generally entitled to receive a full refund of the Swiss withholding tax. The use of such \u201cvirtual second trading line\u201d with respect to share repurchase programs is subject to the approval of the competent Swiss tax and other authorities. We may not be able to repurchase as many shares as we would like to repurchase for purposes of capital reduction on the \u201cvirtual second trading line\u201d without subjecting the selling shareholders to Swiss withholding taxes.\nWe are required, from time to time, to evaluate the carrying amount of our investments in affiliates, as presented on our Swiss standalone balance sheet. If we determine that the carrying amount of any such investment exceeds its fair value, we may conclude that such investment is impaired. The recognized loss associated with such a non-cash impairment could result in our net assets no longer covering our statutory share capital and statutory capital reserves. Under Swiss law, if our net assets cover less than 50 percent of our statutory share capital and statutory capital reserves, the board of directors must convene a general meeting of shareholders and propose measures to remedy such a capital loss. The appropriate measures depend on the relevant circumstances and the magnitude of the recognized loss and may include seeking shareholder approval for offsetting the aggregate loss, or a portion thereof, with our statutory capital reserves, including qualifying additional paid-in capital otherwise available for distributions to shareholders, or raising new equity. Depending on the circumstances, we may also need to use qualifying additional paid-in capital available for distributions in order to reduce our accumulated net loss and such use might reduce our ability to make distributions without subjecting our shareholders to Swiss withholding tax.\nThese Swiss law requirements could limit our flexibility to swiftly implement certain initiatives or strategies.\nWe are subject to anti-takeover provisions.\nOur articles of association and Swiss law contain provisions that could prevent or delay an acquisition of the company by means of a tender offer, a proxy contest or otherwise. Actions taken under such provisions may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our shares, and could, among other things:\n\u25fe provide that the board of directors is authorized, subject to obtaining shareholder approval every two years, at any time during a maximum two-year period, which under our current authorized share capital will expire on May 7, 2022, to issue a specified number of shares, which under our current authorized share capital is approximately 29 percent of the share capital registered in the commercial register as of February 16, 2021, and to limit or withdraw the preemptive rights of existing shareholders in various circumstances;\n\u25fe provide for a conditional share capital that authorizes the issuance of additional shares up to a maximum amount of approximately 22 percent of the share capital registered in the commercial register as of February 16, 2021, without obtaining additional shareholder approval through: (1) the exercise of conversion, exchange, option, warrant or similar rights for the subscription of shares granted in connection with bonds, options, warrants or other securities newly or already issued in national or international capital markets or new or already existing contractual obligations by or of any of our subsidiaries; or (2) in connection with the issuance of shares, options or other share-based awards;\n\u25fe provide that any shareholder who wishes to propose any business or to nominate a person or persons for election as director at any annual meeting may only do so if we are given advance notice;\n\u25fe provide that directors can be removed from office only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3 percent of the shares entitled to vote;\n\u25fe provide that a merger or demerger transaction requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3 percent of the shares represented at the meeting and provide for the possibility of a so-called cash-out or squeeze-out merger if the acquirer controls 90 percent of the outstanding shares entitled to vote at the meeting;\n\u25fe provide that any action required or permitted to be taken by the holders of shares must be taken at a duly called annual or extraordinary general meeting of shareholders;\n\u25fe limit the ability of our shareholders to amend or repeal some provisions of our articles of association; and\n\u25felimit transactions between us and an \u201cinterested shareholder,\u201d which is generally defined as a shareholder that, together with its affiliates and associates, beneficially, directly or indirectly, owns 15 percent or more of our shares entitled to vote at a general meeting.", "PERMNO": 79237, "SIC": 1381, "TIC": "RIG"}
