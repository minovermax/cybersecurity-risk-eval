Risk Factors\nThe risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition, as well as results of operations and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this Form 10-K. The risk factors described below are not the only risks we face. Our business, financial condition and results of operations may also be affected by additional factors that are not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial or that are not specific to us, such as general economic conditions.\nYou should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements included under \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information\u201d of this Form 10-K. All forward-looking statements made by us are qualified by the risk factors described below.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nOur industry and the oil and gas industry are cyclical and our business could be adversely affected by the fluctuating level of capital expenditures by oil and gas companies, the level and volatility of oil and natural gas prices and global supply and demand dynamics.\nOur industry and the oil and gas industry generally are subject to cyclical fluctuations. Demand for our services depends upon spending levels by oil and gas companies for exploration, production, development and field management of oil and natural gas reserves and, in the case of new seismic data creation, the willingness of these companies to forgo ownership in the seismic data. Capital expenditures by oil and gas companies for these activities depend upon several factors, including actual and forecasted prices of oil and natural gas and those companies\u2019 short-term and long-term strategic plans. Oil and natural gas prices in turn depend on local, regional and global events or conditions that affect supply and demand for the relevant commodity. These events or conditions are generally not predictable and include, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe level of supply and demand, the expectations regarding future supply and demand, and the actual levels of production of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe level of prices, and expectations regarding future prices, for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe ability or willingness of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to increase or decrease production levels for oil;\n\u2022\noil and gas production levels by non-OPEC countries;\n\u2022\nworldwide political, military and economic conditions, including social and political unrest in Africa and the Middle East and domestic and foreign governmental regulations and actions (including export restrictions, sanctions, taxes, repatriations and nationalizations);\n\u2022\ngeopolitical uncertainty in the United States and abroad;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting energy exploration, development, production and consumption;\n\u2022\nprice, availability and government subsidies for alternative fuels;\n\u2022\nweather, including seasonal patterns that affect regional energy demand as well as severe weather events that can disrupt supply;\n\u2022\nthe ability of E&P companies to raise equity capital and debt financing or otherwise generate funds for exploration, development and production operations;\n\u2022\nthe cost of exploring for, developing and producing oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe level of oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u2022\nthe rate of discovery of new oil and gas reserves and the decline of existing oil and gas reserves; and\n\u2022\nthe enactment and implementation of government policies, including environmental regulations and tax policies, regarding the exploration, production and development of oil and natural gas reserves and the use of fossil fuels and alternative energy sources.\nOil and natural gas prices are subject to significant volatility and there can be no assurance that oil and natural gas prices and demand will not decline again in the future. Low oil and natural gas prices and demand have resulted in decreased exploration and development spending by oil and gas companies, which could, in turn, impact our seismic data business. Additionally, increases in oil and gas prices may not always result in increased demand for our products and services or otherwise have a positive effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Our customers may adjust their exploration and development spending levels very quickly in response to any material change in oil and natural gas prices. Continued political instability (especially in the Middle East and other oil-producing regions) may lead to further significant fluctuations in demand and pricing for oil and gas or seismic data. Any future decline in oil and natural gas prices, a downturn in the oil and gas or seismic data industries, or sustained periods of reduced capital expenditures by oil and gas companies as a result of factors which are beyond our control, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow.\nIncreased regulation of hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in drilling and completing new oil and natural gas wells, which could adversely impact our revenues by decreasing the demand for our seismic data and related services.\nHydraulic fracturing is the process used by E&P operators of drilling and injecting fluid into a wellbore at high pressure in order to fracture rocks to release the gas or petroleum inside. The process involves the high pressure injection of water, proppants (typically sand) and chemicals into subsurface formations to stimulate gas and petroleum production. Due to public concerns that hydraulic fracturing may adversely affect drinking water supplies, increase emissions of perceived greenhouse gases and/or adversely affect local community infrastructure, including, for example, through increased truck traffic, hydraulic fracturing has become the subject of controversy and increased opposition by certain environmental groups. It has been the subject of numerous private and governmental studies, and has triggered increased governmental regulation. While the process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions, several federal agencies including the EPA and BLM, have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. Congress has from time to time considered the adoption of legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and regional or state agencies with control over the withdrawal of water used in hydraulic fracturing activities may impose stringent conditions on, or delay or prohibit, such water withdrawals. At the state level, a growing number of states have adopted legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. In addition, local governments may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. Furthermore, several federal governmental agencies including the EPA are working with states and other key stakeholders to assess adverse impacts that hydraulic fracturing may have on drinking water or groundwater sources or otherwise to help ensure that natural gas extraction does not come at the expense of public health and the environment. In June 2015, the EPA released its draft report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that hydraulic fracturing activities have not lead to widespread, systemic impacts on drinking water sources in the United States, although there are above and below ground mechanisms by which hydraulic fracturing activities have the potential to impact drinking water sources. However, in January 2016, the EPA\u2019s Science Advisory Board provided its comments on the draft study, indicating its concern that EPA\u2019s conclusion of no widespread, systemic impacts on drinking water sources arising from fracturing activities did not reflect the uncertainties and data limitations associated with such impacts, as described in the body of the draft report. The EPA's final report, \u201cHydraulic Fracturing for Oil and Gas: Impacts from the Hydraulic Fracturing Water Cycle on Drinking Water Resources in the United States,\u201d (EPA-600-R-16-236ES) was issued December 13, 2016 and clarified the findings of the agency\u2019s June 2015 draft report. The EPA concluded that activities throughout the hydraulic fracturing water cycle - from water withdrawal through disposal of produced water - \u201ccan impact [and have impacted], drinking water resources under some circumstances.\u201d In addition to finding that spills of hydraulic fracturing chemicals had sometimes reached drinking water resources, the EPA also identified incidents of the well injection process itself contaminating drinking water resources. One such incident resulted from improper well cementing, while another stemmed from a burst production casing. EPA researchers concluded that six hydraulic fracturing activities are \u201cmore likely than others to result in more frequent or more severe impacts\u201d to drinking water: water withdrawals; chemical spills; injection of fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity; injection of fluids directly into groundwater; inappropriate discharge of fracturing wastewater into streams and lakes; and storage of fracturing wastewater in unlined pits.\nIn a different political environment, regulators might have relied on the final report to support additional rulemaking at the federal level to protect drinking water resources from hydraulic fracturing impacts. With the new administration, new federal requirements on hydraulic fracturing are unlikely and regulation of fracking activities will likely fall to the states which may, under the incoming administration, not be anxious to issue new regulations or take aggressive enforcement action. According to the EPA, the understanding of potential impacts from hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources will continue to improve over time as new information becomes available. This final report, as well as other studies, depending on any meaningful results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing, which events could delay or curtail production of oil and natural gas by E&P operators, some of which are our customers, and thus reduce demand for our seismic data and related services. Additionally, any such decrease in the demand for our seismic data and related services could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.\nBecause of more stringent existing or any new federal, state or local legal restrictions related to the hydraulic fracturing process in areas where our E&P customers operate, those customers could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements and experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities, which could reduce demand for our seismic data and related services.\nEconomic conditions could adversely affect demand for our seismic data and related services and could increase our credit risk of customer non-payment.\nPrices for oil and natural gas fluctuate widely. Prolonged or substantial declines in crude oil and/or natural gas prices have resulted in many oil and gas companies significantly reducing their levels of capital spending, and such reduction could\nintensify which could result in reduced demand for our seismic data and related services as our customers\u2019 operating cash flow decreases and the borrowing bases under their oil and gas reserve-based credit facilities are reduced. Prolonged or substantial declines in commodity prices could also result in decreases in our customers\u2019 liquidity and capital resources, which could increase our credit risk of non-payment from such customers.\nWe are dependent on the availability of internally generated cash flow and financing alternatives to cover the costs of acquiring and processing seismic data for our data library that are not underwritten by our customers.\nWe invest additional capital in acquiring and processing new seismic data to expand our data library. A significant portion of these costs is underwritten by our customers, while the remainder is financed through the use of internally generated cash flow and other financing sources. We may use bank or commercial debt, the issuance of equity or debt securities or any combination thereof to finance these costs. There can be no assurance that our customers will continue to underwrite these costs at historical levels, or that we will have available internally generated funds or will be successful in obtaining sufficient capital through additional financing or other transactions, if required, on terms acceptable to us, to continue to invest in acquiring new seismic data. Any substantial alteration of or increase in our capitalization through the issuance of debt securities may significantly increase our leverage and decrease our financial flexibility. If we are unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms or at all, we may be forced to finance our operations with only internally generated funds, and if we are unable to generate sufficient funds internally, we may be unable to execute our business strategies.\nOur working capital needs are difficult to forecast and may vary significantly, which could require us to seek financing that we may not be able to obtain on satisfactory terms, or at all.\nOur working capital needs are difficult to predict with certainty as they fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on the level of activity of our business. This difficulty is due primarily to the timing of our projects, our customers' budgetary cycles and our receipt of payment. We may therefore be subject to significant and rapid increases in our working capital needs that could require us to seek financing sources. Restrictions in our debt agreement may impair our ability to obtain other sources of financing, and access to sources of financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nWe have invested, and expect to continue to invest, significant amounts of money in acquiring and processing seismic data for our seismic data library without knowing precisely how much of this seismic data we will be able to license or when and at what price we will be able to license such data.\nWe invest significant amounts of money in acquiring and processing seismic data for our seismic data library, albeit at a reduced level in low commodity price environments. By making such investments, we are exposed to the following risks:\n\u2022\nWe may not fully recover our costs of acquiring and processing seismic data through future licensing of data that we own. The amounts of these data sales are uncertain and depend on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control.\n\u2022\nThe timing of these sales is unpredictable and can vary greatly from quarter to quarter. The costs of each survey are capitalized and then amortized over the expected book life of the data. This amortization will affect our earnings and when combined with the sporadic nature of sales, will result in increased earnings volatility.\n\u2022\nRegulatory changes that affect companies\u2019 ability to drill, either generally or in a specific location where we have acquired seismic data, could materially adversely affect the value of the seismic data contained in our library. In addition, technology changes could also make existing data sets less desirable or obsolete.\n\u2022\nThe value of our data could be significantly adversely affected if any material adverse change occurs in the general prospects for oil and gas exploration, development and production activities.\n\u2022\nThe cost estimates upon which we base our pre-commitments of funding could be incorrect, which could result in losses that have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022\nUnderwriting commitments of funding are subject to the creditworthiness of our customers. In the event that a customer refuses or is unable to pay its commitment, we could lose a material amount of money.\nThe cyclical nature of the oil and gas industry can have a significant effect on our revenues and profitability. Historically, oil and natural gas prices, as well as the level of exploration and developmental activity, have fluctuated significantly. These fluctuations have in the past, and may in the future, adversely affect our business. We are unable to predict future oil and natural gas prices or the level of oil and gas industry activity. Prolonged periods of low commodity prices depress development activity, adversely affecting the demand for our products and services and our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on developing and acquiring proprietary data, and if we are unable to maintain its confidentiality, we could be materially negatively affected.\nOur customer data license agreements and acquisition agreements identify our proprietary, confidential information and require that such information is restricted to the licensee and must be kept confidential. However, we cannot ensure that unauthorized use, misappropriation or disclosure will not occur. The rise in bankruptcy filings in 2016 and in recent months by some of our customers places our data license agreements at risk of unauthorized assumption and/or assignment. If we are unable to prevent the assumption and/or assignment or otherwise maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary, confidential information, we could be materially negatively affected.\nOur business could be negatively affected by security threats, including cybersecurity threats, and other disruptions.\nWe face various security threats, including cybersecurity threats, to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable. While we have redundant security systems in place to protect our sensitive data, the potential for such security threats subjects our operations to increased risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business. Designing and implementing procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate security threats and to increase security for our information and infrastructure is capital intensive, and there can be no assurance that such procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring. If any of these security breaches were to occur, they could lead to losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure or capabilities essential to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Cybersecurity attacks in particular are becoming more sophisticated and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. These events could damage our reputation and lead to financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability for asserted claims.\nOur business could be adversely affected by the failure of our customers to fulfill their obligations to reimburse us for the underwritten portion of third-party contractor costs.\nA substantial portion of our seismic acquisition project costs, including third-party project costs, is underwritten by our customers. Historically, we have targeted an average of 60% to 70% underwriting levels for new seismic acquisition projects on an aggregate basis. In low commodity price environments, we may target higher underwriting levels, which may increase the risk that our customers fail to fulfill their obligations to reimburse us. On occasion, when our underwriting customer owns other appealing seismic data that we want to obtain, we may decide to take ownership in this data to cover a portion of the customer's underwriting obligation. In the event that underwriters for such projects fail to fulfill their obligations with respect to such underwriting commitments, we would continue to be obligated to satisfy our payment obligations to third-party contractors.\nWe rely on third-party contractors to shoot new data.\nWe do not employ seismic crews or own any seismic survey equipment but contract, as needed, multiple third-party contractors with qualified equipment, personnel and expertise to shoot new data. Any failure, however, by these third-party contractors to meet the requisite industry quality, safety and environmental standards could result in our liability to third parties and have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, if we fail to retain our third-party contractors or obtain replacements on favorable terms or at all, our business and operating results may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may be held liable for the actions of third-party contractors.\nWe often engage a number of third-party contractors to perform specific services and provide products and qualified personnel in connection with our operations. There can be no assurance that we will not be held liable for the actions or inactions of these contractors. In addition, contractors may cause damage or injury to our personnel and property or third-party personnel or property, which may not be fully covered by insurance.\nCompetition for the acquisition of new seismic data is intense.\nThere are a number of geophysical services companies that create, market and license seismic data and maintain seismic libraries. Competition for acquisition of new seismic data among geophysical service providers in the United States and Canada historically has been, and we expect will continue to be, intense. Certain competitors have significantly greater financial and other resources than we do. These larger and better-financed operators could enjoy an advantage over us in a competitive environment for the limited opportunities to acquire new data.\nOur operating results and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to circumstances that are beyond our control.\nOur operating results and cash flows from operations have in the past, and may in the future, vary in material respects from period to period. Factors that have and could cause variations include, but are not limited to, (1) timing of the receipt and commencement of contracts for data acquisition, (2) our customers' budgetary cycles and their effect on the demand for geophysical products and services, (3) seasonal factors, (4) weather conditions, (5) the timing of cash resales and selections of significant geophysical data from our data library, which are not typically made in a linear or consistent pattern and (6) technological or regulatory changes. These revenue fluctuations could produce unexpected adverse operating results in any period.\nThere are risks and uncertainties associated with our operations in Mexico.\nHistorically, Mexico has been subject to political and social instability, and our operations in Mexico may expose us to various levels of foreign political, economic and other risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, terrorism, hostage taking, military repression, extreme fluctuations in currency exchange rates, high rates of inflation, labor unrest, the risk of war or civil unrest, expropriation and nationalization, renegotiation or nullification of existing concessions,\nlicenses, permits, approvals and contracts, changes in taxation policies, restrictions on foreign exchange and repatriation, changing political conditions and currency controls. Furthermore, change and uncertainty in Mexico could lead to changes in\nexisting governmental laws and regulations affecting oil and gas exploration and production, which could adversely impact demand for our seismic data. Shifts in political conditions may increase the cost of conducting our business in Mexico.\nA reduction in demand for our seismic data may result in an impairment of the value of our seismic data library.\nReduced demand, future sales or cash flows may result in a requirement to increase amortization rates or record impairment charges to reduce the carrying value of our data library. Such increases or charges, if required, could be material to operating results in the periods in which they are recorded. For purposes of evaluating potential impairment losses, we estimate the future cash flows attributable to a library component by evaluating historical and recent revenue trends, oil and gas prospectivity in particular regions, general economic conditions affecting our customer base, expected changes in technology and other factors that we deem relevant. As a result of these factors, among others, estimations of future cash flows are highly subjective, inherently imprecise and can fluctuate materially from period to period. Accordingly, if conditions change in the future, we may record impairment losses relative to our seismic data library, which could materially affect our results of operations in any particular reporting period.\nFailure to meet cash flow projections may result in goodwill impairment charges.\nWe perform an annual assessment of the recoverability of goodwill. Additionally, we assess goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable. If required to perform a goodwill impairment test, we rely on discounted cash flow analysis, which requires significant judgments and estimates about our future operations, to develop our estimates of fair value. If these projected cash flows change materially, we may be required to record impairment losses relative to goodwill which could be material to our results of operations in any particular reporting period.\nOur Canadian operations subject us to currency translation risk, which could cause our results to fluctuate significantly from period to period.\nA portion of our revenues is derived from our Canadian activities and operations. As a result, we translate the results of our Canadian operations and financial condition into U.S. dollars. Therefore, our reported results of operations and financial condition are subject to changes in the exchange rate between the two currencies. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our revenue, expenses and operating margins. Assets and liabilities of our Canadian operations are translated from Canadian dollars into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the relevant balance sheet date, and revenue and expenses of our Canadian operations are translated from Canadian dollars into U.S. dollars at exchange rates as of the dates on which they are recognized. Translation adjustments related to assets and liabilities are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholder's equity. Realized gains and losses on translation of our Canadian operations into U.S. dollars are included in net income. Currently, we do not hedge our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates.\nWe may be unable to attract and retain key employees.\nOur success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled geophysical professionals and other technical personnel. Failure to continue attracting and retaining these individuals could adversely affect our ability to compete in the geophysical services industry. We may confront significant and potentially adverse competition for key personnel.\nOur success also depends to a significant extent upon the abilities and efforts of members of our senior executive management, the loss of whom could adversely affect our business. Senior executives, which include our Chief Executive Officer and President, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Technology Officer and President of Seitel Canada Ltd., and President of Seitel Data, Ltd. have employment agreements with us. We cannot be certain that our senior executives will continue to be employed by us for an indefinite period of time and, if they do, how long they will remain so employed. Any inability to attract and retain key management personnel could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manage our business properly.\nWe are subject to certain types of claims in the ordinary course of business.\nWe may become involved in, named as a party to, or be the subject of, various legal matters, including regulatory proceedings, and litigation asserting claims for personal injury, property damage, trespass, and contract disputes. The outcome of pending or future proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty and may be determined adversely to us and as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our assets, liabilities, business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and future prospects.\nCurrent and future government regulation may negatively impact demand for our products and services and increase our cost of conducting business.\nThe conduct of our business and the demand for our products and services are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, provincial, state and local governmental authorities and agencies in the United States and Canada. We may incur significant costs and delays in order to attain or maintain compliance with these legal requirements. These laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations that are applicable to our operations including:\n\u2022\nthe acquisition of permits before commencing regulated activities;\n\u2022\nthe limitation or prohibition of seismic activities in environmentally sensitive or protected areas such as wetlands or wilderness areas; and\n\u2022\nthe application of specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection.\nFurther, failure to comply with laws, regulations, permits, and First Nations and Native Americans protocol may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations and the issuance of injunctions limiting or preventing some or all of our operations. In the oil and gas industry more generally, protracted approval processes, including consultations with First Nations in Canada and Native Americans in the U.S., for proposed projects could dampen investment in new projects, and thereby negatively impact demand for our products and services.\nAdditionally, these laws, regulations and government policies may change as a result of changing political, economic or social climate. Such changes may alter the environment in which we do business as well as the demand for our products and services and, therefore, may impact the results of our operations or increase our liabilities. More stringent new and future laws, regulations and policies concerning hydraulic fracturing activities, emissions of greenhouse gases and the use of renewable energy sources rather than fossil fuels could negatively impact the operations of our customers. Further future changes in these and other laws and regulations or the imposition of additional regulations that have a negative financial impact on E&P operators, some of which are our customers, could result in decreased demand for our products and services. Moreover, complying with more stringent regulations could cause an increase in our operating expenses, which could adversely affect our business.\nTechnological changes not available to us could adversely affect our business.\nNew data acquisition or processing technologies may be developed. New and enhanced products and services introduced by one of our competitors may gain market acceptance and, if not available to us, may adversely affect our business.\nOur internal controls for financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent all possible errors that could occur.\nOur Chief Executive Officer and President and our Chief Financial Officer evaluate, on a quarterly basis, our internal controls for financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures, which includes a review of the objectives, design, implementation and effect of the controls in respect of the information generated for use in our periodic reports. In the course of\nour controls evaluation, we seek to identify data errors, control problems and confirm that appropriate corrective action, including process improvements, are being undertaken. The overall goals of these various evaluation activities are to monitor our internal controls for financial reporting, to monitor our disclosure controls and procedures, and to make modifications as necessary. Our intent in this regard is that our internal controls for financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures will be maintained as dynamic systems that change (including with improvements and corrections) as conditions warrant.\nA control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be satisfied. Our management has concluded that our internal controls for financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to give a reasonable assurance that they are effective to achieve their objectives. We cannot provide absolute assurance that we have detected all possible control issues. These inherent limitations include the possibility that judgments in our decision-making could be faulty, and that isolated breakdowns could occur because of simple human error or mistake. The design of our system of controls is based, in part, upon certain assumptions regarding the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed absolutely in achieving our stated goals under all potential future or unforeseeable conditions. In light of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud could occur and not be detected. Breakdowns in our internal controls and procedures could occur in the future, and any such breakdowns could have an adverse effect on our business.\nTax authorities may reassess our tax calculations, or may change their administrative policies to our detriment.\nThere can be no assurance that the relevant tax authorities will agree with how we calculate our income for tax purposes or that such tax authorities will not change their administrative practices to our detriment.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INDEBTEDNESS\nOur level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to fulfill our payment obligations and operate our business.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $251.5 million of total outstanding indebtedness, including $1.5 million of capital leases. Our 2017 consolidated annual debt service requirements are expected to aggregate approximately $24.1 million. We may also incur additional indebtedness in the future.\nOur level of indebtedness could have negative consequences to us, including:\n\u2022\nwe may have difficulty satisfying our obligations with respect to our debt;\n\u2022\nwe may have difficulty obtaining financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes;\n\u2022\nwe may need to use all, or a substantial portion, of our available cash flow to pay interest and principal on our debt, which will reduce the amount of money available to finance our operations and other business activities;\n\u2022\nour vulnerability to general economic downturns and adverse industry conditions could increase;\n\u2022\nour flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and in our industry in general could be limited;\n\u2022\nour amount of debt and the amount we must pay to service our debt obligations could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;\n\u2022\nour customers may react adversely to our significant debt level and seek or develop alternative licensors or suppliers;\n\u2022\nwe may have insufficient funds, and our debt level may also restrict us from raising the funds necessary to repurchase all of the notes tendered to us upon the occurrence of a change of control, which would constitute an event of default under the notes; and\n\u2022\nour failure to comply with the restrictive covenants in our debt instruments which, among other things, limit our ability to incur debt and sell assets, could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business or prospects.\nOur level of indebtedness requires that we use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, which will reduce the availability of cash to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures, research and development and other general corporate or business activities, including future acquisitions.\nThe indenture governing our $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of 9\u00bd% senior notes due 2019 (\u201cthe 9\u00bd% Senior Notes\u201d) contains a number of restrictive covenants, which limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in our interest.\nThe indenture governing our 9\u00bd% Senior Notes imposes, and the terms of any future indebtedness may impose, operating and other restrictions on us and our subsidiaries. Such restrictions affect or will affect, and in many respects limit or prohibit, among other things, our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\npay dividends and make other distributions in respect of our capital stock;\n\u2022\nredeem our capital stock;\n\u2022\nmake investments or certain other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nsell certain kinds of assets;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\neffect mergers or consolidations.\nThe restrictions contained in the indenture governing our 9\u00bd% Senior Notes could:\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to plan for or react to market or economic conditions or meet capital needs or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans; and\n\u2022\nadversely affect our ability to finance our operations, acquisitions, investments or strategic alliances or other capital needs or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest.\nA breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the indenture governing our 9\u00bd% Senior Notes. If an event of default occurs, the lenders could elect to:\n\u2022\ndeclare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest, to be immediately due and payable; or\n\u2022\nrequire us to apply all of our available cash to repay the borrowings.\nIf we were unable to repay or otherwise refinance these borrowings when due, we cannot assure that sufficient assets will remain to repay the 9\u00bd% Senior Notes.", "PERMNO": 91804, "SIC": 1382, "TIC": "3SELA"}
