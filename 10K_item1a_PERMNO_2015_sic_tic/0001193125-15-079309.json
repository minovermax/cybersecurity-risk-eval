{"cik": "1031623", "company": "GULF ISLAND FABRICATION INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-06", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nCautionary Statement\nOur business is subject to significant risks. We caution readers that the following important factors could affect our actual consolidated results and could cause our actual consolidated results in the future to differ materially from the goals and expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements contained in this report and in any other forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf.\nWe are subject to the cyclical nature of the oil and gas industry.\nOur business depends primarily on the level of capital expenditures by oil and gas companies in the Gulf of Mexico and along the Gulf Coast. This level of activity has traditionally been volatile, primarily as a result of fluctuations in oil and gas prices. Projects for which we are engaged may be deferred or delayed by our customers based, in part, on the price of oil and gas. The levels of our customers\u2019 capital expenditures are influenced by, among other things:\n\u2022\noil and gas prices and industry perceptions of future prices;\n\u2022\nthe cost of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and gas;\n\u2022\nthe ability of oil and gas companies to generate capital;\n\u2022\nthe sale and expiration dates of offshore leases in the United States and overseas;\n\u2022\nthe discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves in offshore areas;\n\u2022\nlocal, federal and international political and economic conditions;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances; and\n\u2022\nuncertainty regarding the United States energy policy, particularly any revision, reinterpretation or creation of environmental and tax laws and regulations that would negatively impact the industry.\nAlthough activity levels in production and development sectors of the oil and gas industry are less volatile than the exploration sector, producers generally react to declining oil and gas prices by reducing expenditures. This has in the past and may in the future adversely affect our business. We are unable to predict future oil and gas prices or the level of oil and gas industry activity in the Gulf of Mexico region and internationally. A prolonged low level of activity in the oil and gas industry will adversely affect the demand for our products and services, our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur backlog is subject to change as a result of changes to management\u2019s estimates, suspension or termination of projects currently in our backlog or our failure to secure additional projects. Our revenue, net income and cash flow could be adversely affected as a result of changes to our backlog.\nOur backlog is based on management\u2019s estimate of the direct labor hours required to complete, and the remaining revenue to be recognized with respect to, those projects as to which a customer has authorized us to begin work or purchase materials or services pursuant to written contracts, letters of intent or other forms of authorization. However, management\u2019s estimates are often based on preliminary engineering and design specifications by the customer. As engineering and design plans are finalized or changes to existing plans are made, management\u2019s estimate of the direct labor hours required to complete and price at completion is likely to change.\nAll projects currently included in our backlog generally are subject to suspension, termination, or a reduction in scope at the option of the customer, although the customer is generally required to pay us for work performed and materials purchased through the date of termination. In addition, customers have the ability to delay the execution of projects. Depending on the size of the project, the termination, postponement, or change in\nscope of any project could significantly reduce backlog, and could have a material adverse effect on revenue, net income and cash flow. Accordingly, our backlog as of any particular date is an uncertain indicator of future earnings.\nDeepwater projects have historically represented a significant part of our backlog. As of December 31, 2014, we had a revenue backlog of $184.7 million and a labor backlog of approximately 1.7 million man-hours. With respect to backlog at December 31, 2014, $70.1 million, or approximately 38.0%, represents projects destined for deepwater locations. Since the scope of work and contract prices on most deepwater projects typically represent a substantial portion of overall backlog, a suspension, termination, or change in scope of any of these projects is likely to have a more significant adverse impact on revenue, net income and cash flow as compared to other projects. For example, in 2013, we recognized estimated contract losses of $29.6 million on a large deepwater project as a result of our inability to recover certain costs and the de-scoping of the project, whereby remaining completion and integration work was performed by a different integration contractor. In 2012, we entered into a contract with another deepwater customer to suspend work on one of our major projects and, following the customer\u2019s failure to pay the outstanding balance of $31.3 million on the contract on or before March 31, 2013, terminated the contract with our customer.\nWe might be unable to employ a sufficient number of skilled workers.\nOur ability to remain productive and profitable depends substantially on our ability to attract and retain skilled construction workers, primarily welders, fitters and equipment operators. In addition, our ability to expand our operations depends not only upon customer demand but also on our ability to increase our labor force. The demand for such workers is high and the supply is extremely limited, especially during periods of high activity in the oil and gas industry. While we believe our relationship with our skilled labor force is good, a significant increase in the wages paid by a wide range of other employers seeking similar skill sets could result in a reduction in our skilled labor force, increases in the wage rates we pay, increase in our use of contract labor, or all of these. Additionally, reductions made, from time to time, in our labor force may make it more difficult for us to increase our labor force to desirable levels during periods of increased customer demand for our services. If any of these occurred in the near-term, the profits expected from work in progress could be reduced or eliminated and to the extent such wage increases could not be passed on to our customers, our production capacity could be diminished and growth potential could be impaired.\nThe dangers inherent in our operations and the limits on our insurance coverage could expose us to potentially significant liability costs and materially interfere with the performance of our operations.\nThe fabrication of large steel structures involves operating hazards that can cause personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment and suspension of operations. The failure of such structures during and after installation can result in similar injuries and damages. In addition, our employees may engage in certain activities, including interconnect piping and other service activities conducted on offshore platforms, activities performed on the spud barges owned or chartered by us, marine vessel fabrication and repair activities performed at our facilities and operating vessels owned by us, that are covered in either the provisions of the Jones Act or USL&H. These laws operate to make the liability limits established under state workers\u2019 compensation laws inapplicable to these employees and, instead, permit them or their representatives to pursue actions against us for damages or job related injuries, with generally no limitations on our potential liability.\nOur ownership and operation of vessels can give rise to large and varied liability risks, such as risks of collisions with other vessels or structures, sinkings, fires and other marine casualties, which can result in significant claims for damages against both us and third parties. Litigation arising from any such occurrences may result in our being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting large claims. In addition, due to the proximity to the Gulf of Mexico, our facilities are subject to the possibility of physical damage caused by hurricanes or flooding.\nAlthough we believe that our insurance coverage is adequate, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable or that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover future claims that may arise. Claims for which we are not fully insured may adversely affect our working capital and profitability. In addition, changes in the insurance industry have generally led to higher insurance costs and decreased availability of coverage. The availability of insurance that covers risks we and our competitors typically insure against may decrease, and the insurance that we are able to obtain may have higher deductibles, higher premiums and more restrictive policy terms.\nOur industry is highly competitive.\nThe offshore and marine fabrication industry is highly competitive and influenced by events largely outside of our control. Contracts for our services are generally awarded on a competitive bid basis, and our customers consider many factors when awarding a job. These factors include price, the contractor\u2019s ability to meet the customer\u2019s delivery schedule, the availability and capability of equipment, and the reputation, experience, and safety record of the contractor. Although we believe that our reputation for safety and quality service is good, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain our competitive position. We compete with both large and small companies for available jobs, and certain of our competitors, particularly our domestic competitor for major deepwater projects, have greater financial and other resources than we do.\nForeign governments often use subsidies and incentives to create local jobs where oil and gas production is being developed. In addition, decreased transportation costs incurred by our customers when exporting structures from foreign locations to the Gulf of Mexico may hinder our ability to successfully bid for projects in the Gulf of Mexico against foreign competitors. Because of subsidies, import duties and fees, taxes on foreign operators, lower wage rates in foreign countries, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar, the possible imposition of tariffs on raw materials imported into the United States, and other factors, we may not be able to remain competitive with foreign contractors for large deepwater projects. For additional information, see \u201cBusiness and Properties - Competition\u201d for more information regarding the competitive nature of our industry.\nCompetitive pricing common in the fabrication industry may not provide sufficient protection from cost overruns.\nAs is common in the offshore platform fabrication industry, a substantial number of our projects are performed on a fixed-price or unit-rate basis, although some projects are performed on an alliance/partnering or cost-plus basis. Under fixed-price or unit-rate contracts, we receive the price fixed in the contract, subject to adjustment only for change-orders placed by the customer. Under a unit rate contract, material items or labor tasks are assigned unit rates of measure. The unit rates of measure will generally be an amount of dollars per ton, per foot, per square foot or per item installed. A typical unit rate contract can contain hundreds to thousands of unit rates of measure. Profit margins are built in to the unit rates and, similar to a fixed price contract, we retain all cost savings but are also responsible for all cost overruns. Under typical alliance/partnering arrangements, the parties agree in advance to a target price that includes specified levels of labor, material costs and profit margins. If the project is completed at less cost than that targeted in the contract, the contract price is reduced by a portion of the savings. If the cost of completion is greater than target costs, the contract price is increased, but generally to the target price plus the actual incremental cost of materials and direct labor. Accordingly, under alliance/partnering arrangements, we have some protection against cost overruns but must share a portion of any cost savings with the customer. Under cost-plus arrangements, we receive a specified fee in excess of our direct labor and material cost and thus are protected against cost overruns, but do not benefit directly from cost savings.\nThe revenue, costs and gross profit realized on a contract will often vary from the estimated amounts on which such contracts were originally based due to, among other things:\n\u2022\nchanges in the availability and cost of labor and material;\n\u2022\nvariations in productivity from the original estimates;\n\u2022\nour inability to recover compensation for additional work we perform or expenses we incur as a result of customer change orders or customer delays in delivering or deviations to designs and drawings;\n\u2022\nchanges in estimates or bidding;\n\u2022\nour payment of liquidated damages upon a failure to meet scheduled delivery requirements; and\n\u2022\ntermination or de-scoping of projects by our customers.\nThese variations and the risks inherent in our industry may result in revenue and gross profits different from those originally estimated and reduce profitability or create losses on projects. Depending on the size of a project, variations from estimated contract performance can have a significant impact on our operating results for any particular fiscal quarter or year.\nFor example, we recognized contract losses of $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 that were primarily related to two tank barge projects for a marine transportation company, platform supply vessels for an offshore marine company and a production platform jacket for a deepwater customer. We also recognized contract losses of $29.6 million as of December 31, 2013 on one of our large deepwater projects, mainly due to our inability to recover certain costs and the de-scoping of one of our major deepwater contracts.\nOur failure to successfully defend against claims made against us by customers or subcontractors, or our failure to successfully recover on claims made by us against customers or subcontractors, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur projects are generally highly complex and we may encounter difficulties in design or engineering, schedule changes and other factors, some of which may be beyond our control, that affect our ability to complete projects in accordance with original delivery schedules or to otherwise meet contractual performance obligations. We may bring claims against customers for additional costs exceeding contract prices or for amounts not included in original contract prices as a result of customer-caused delays or changes from initial project scope. In addition, claims may be brought against us by customers relating to, among other things, alleged defective or incomplete work, breaches of warranty and/or late completion of work. Claims among us and our subcontractors may include claims similar to those described above. These claims may be subject to lengthy and/or expensive litigation or arbitration proceedings, and we may invest significant working capital in projects to cover cost overruns pending resolution of these claims. These claims could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur method of accounting for revenue could result in an earnings charge.\nMost of our revenue is recognized on a percentage-of-completion basis based on the ratio of direct labor hours worked to the total estimated direct labor hours required for completion. Accordingly, contract price and cost estimates are reviewed monthly as the work progresses, and adjustments proportionate to the percentage of completion are reflected in revenue for the period when such estimates are revised. To the extent that these adjustments result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported profits, we are required to recognize a charge against current earnings, which may be significant depending on the size of the project or the adjustment.\nFor example, we recognized contract losses of $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 that were primarily related to two tank barges projects for a marine transportation company, platform supply vessels for an offshore marine company and a production platform jacket for a deepwater customer. We also recognized contract losses of $29.6 million as of December 31, 2013 on one of our large deepwater projects, mainly due to our inability to recover certain costs and the de-scoping of one of our major deepwater contracts.\nWe are susceptible to adverse weather conditions in our market areas.\nOur operations are directly affected by the seasonal differences in weather patterns in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as daylight hours. Since most of our construction activities take place outdoors, the number of direct labor\nhours worked generally declines in the winter months due to an increase in rain, colder temperatures, and a decrease in daylight hours. The seasonality of oil and gas industry activity as a whole in the Gulf Coast region also affects our operations. Our customers often schedule the completion of their projects during the summer months in order to take advantage of milder weather for the installation of their platforms. The rainy weather, tropical storms, hurricanes and other storms prevalent in the Gulf of Mexico and along the Gulf Coast throughout the year may also affect our operations. Accordingly, our operating results may vary from quarter to quarter, depending on factors outside of our control. As a result, full year results are not likely to be a direct multiple of any particular quarter or combination of quarters.\nWe depend on key personnel.\nOur success depends to a great degree on the abilities of our key management personnel, particularly our executives and other key employees. The loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could adversely affect us.\nWe depend on significant customers.\nWe derive a significant amount of our revenue from a small number of major and independent oil and gas and marine companies. Generally, our major oil and gas customers engage us for large deepwater fabrication projects. Because the level of fabrication that we may provide to any particular customer depends, among other things, on the size of that customer\u2019s capital expenditure budget devoted to platform construction plans in a particular year and our ability to meet the customer\u2019s delivery schedule, customers that account for a significant portion of our revenue in one fiscal year may represent an immaterial portion of revenue in subsequent years. For example, our largest customers (those which individually accounted for 10% or more of revenue in a given year) accounted for 51% of revenue in 2014 (32% for Walter Oil and Gas Corporation and 19% for Anadarko Petroleum Corporation), 60% of revenue in 2013 (36% for Williams Field Services - Gulf Coast Company, L.P. and 24% for Chevron USA, Inc.), and 61% of revenue in 2012 (37% for Chevron USA, Inc. and 24% for Williams Field Services - Gulf Coast Company, L.P.). The loss of a significant customer in any given year for any reason, including a sustained decline in that customer\u2019s capital expenditure budget or competitive factors, can result in a substantial loss of revenue and could have a material adverse effect on our operating performance.\nThe nature of our industry subjects us to compliance with regulatory and environmental laws.\nOur operations and properties are materially affected by state and federal laws and other regulations relating to the oil and gas industry in general, as well as a wide variety of federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those governing discharges into the air and water, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, the remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous substances and the health and safety of employees. Compliance with many of these laws is becoming increasingly complex, stringent and expensive. Many of these laws impose \u201cstrict liability\u201d for damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety, rendering a party liable for the environmental damage without regard to its negligence or fault. Certain environmental laws provide for strict, joint and several liability for remediation of spills and other releases of hazardous substances, as well as damage to natural resources. In addition, we could be subject to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as a result of alleged exposure to hazardous substances. Such laws and regulations may also expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others, or for acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time such acts were performed. We believe that our present operations substantially comply with applicable federal and state pollution control and environmental protection laws and regulations. We also believe that compliance with such laws has had no material adverse effect on our operations. However, such environmental laws are changed frequently. Sanctions for noncompliance may include revocation of permits, corrective action orders, administrative or civil penalties and criminal prosecution. We are unable to predict whether environmental laws will materially adversely affect our future operations and financial results. See \u201cBusiness and Properties - Government and Environmental Regulation.\u201d\nThe demand for our services is also affected by changing taxes, price controls and other laws and regulations relating to the oil and gas industry generally. Offshore construction and drilling in certain areas has also been opposed by environmental groups and, in certain areas, has been restricted. To the extent laws are enacted or other governmental actions are taken that prohibit or restrict offshore construction and drilling or impose environmental protection requirements that result in increased costs to the oil and gas industry in general and the offshore construction industry in particular, our business and prospects could be adversely affected. We cannot determine to what extent future operations and earnings may be affected by new legislation, new regulations or changes in existing regulations.\nOur business is highly dependent on our ability to utilize the Houma Navigation Canal and Corpus Christi Ship Channel.\nThe Houma Navigation Canal provides the only means of access from our Louisiana facilities to open waters. With respect to our Texas facilities, the Intercoastal Waterway provides access between our North and South Texas yards. From our South Texas yard, the Corpus Christi Ship Channel provides access to the Gulf of Mexico. These waterways are considered to be navigable waterways of the United States and, as such, are protected by federal law from unauthorized obstructions that would hinder water-borne traffic. Federal law also authorizes maintenance of these waterways by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. These waterways are dredged from time to time to maintain water depth and, while federal funding for dredging has historically been provided, there is no assurance that Congressional appropriations sufficient for adequate dredging and other maintenance of these waterways will be continued indefinitely. If sufficient funding were not appropriated for that purpose, some or all of these waterways could become impassable by barges or other vessels required to transport many of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position.\nWe depend on subcontractor services to perform our contractual obligations.\nOur ability to perform under our contracts depends to some degree on the performance of third parties we subcontract. We depend upon subcontractors for a variety of reasons, including:\n\u2022\nto perform work as a result of scheduling demands we would otherwise perform with our employees;\n\u2022\nto supervise and/or perform certain aspects of the contract more efficiently considering the conditions of the contract; and\n\u2022\nto perform certain types of skilled work.\nWe work closely with these subcontractors to monitor progress and address our customer requirements. We generally have the ability to pursue back charges for costs we incur or liabilities we assume as a result of a subcontractor\u2019s lack of performance. However, the inability of our subcontractors to perform under the terms of their contracts could cause us to incur additional costs that reduce profitability or create losses on projects.\nWe are exposed to risks arising out of recent legislation affecting U.S. public companies.\nChanging laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosures, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and related regulations implemented thereunder, are increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. Any failure to successfully or timely complete annual assessments of our internal controls required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could subject us to sanctions or investigations by regulatory authorities. Any such action could adversely affect our financial results or our reputation with investors, lenders and others.", "PERMNO": 84737, "SIC": 3730, "TIC": "GIFI"}
