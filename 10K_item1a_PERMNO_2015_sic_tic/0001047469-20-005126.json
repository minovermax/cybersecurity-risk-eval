{"cik": "1680379", "company": "Sterling Bancorp, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-10-06", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe face a number of significant risks and uncertainties in connection with our operations. Our business and the results of our operations could be materially adversely affected by the factors described below. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our operations. Risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Advantage Loan Program\nThe Internal Review results indicate numerous instances of misconduct by employees in connection with the origination of residential mortgage loans in our Advantage Loan Program.\nThe primary focus of the Internal Review has involved the origination of residential mortgage loans under the Advantage Loan Program and related matters. Results from the Internal Review have indicated that certain employees engaged in misconduct in connection with the origination of a significant number of such loans, including with respect to verification of income, the amount of income reported for borrowers, reliance on third parties, and related documentation. In connection with the Internal Review, a significant number of officers and employees were terminated or resigned, including the top loan producers within the Advantage Program.\nWhile the Internal Review is substantially complete, the Company expects it to remain open during the pendency of the government investigations discussed below, and it is possible additional work will be required in connection with the Internal Review.\nThe misconduct of employees discovered during the Internal Review has resulted in a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations through the expenditure of significant expenses on third parties and the expenditure of significant internal resources for the conduct of the Internal Review, damage to our reputation, termination of a core part of our operating model, and a number of additional material risks identified in the Risk Factors set forth below. In addition, if further work is required in connection with the Internal Review, management's time and resources could be diverted, and we may incur significant legal and other expenses in connection with such additional work.\nPending governmental investigations may result in adverse findings, reputational damage, the imposition of sanctions and other negative consequences which could adversely affect our financial condition and future operating results.\nThe Bank is currently under formal investigation by the OCC relating to certain aspects of its BSA/AML compliance program as well as the Bank's credit administration. The Bank also has received grand jury subpoenas from the DOJ beginning in 2020 requesting the production of documents and information in connection with an investigation that appears to be focused on the Bank's residential lending practices and related issues. The outcome of the pending government investigations is uncertain. There can be no assurance (i) that we will not incur material losses due to damages, penalties, costs and/or expenses as a result of such investigations, (ii) that the reserves we have established will be sufficient to cover such losses or (iii) that such losses will not materially exceed such reserves and have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. In addition, management's time and resources will be diverted to address the investigation and any related litigation, and we may incur significant legal and other expenses in our defense of the investigation and any related litigation.\nWe are subject to pending securities class action and legal proceedings that may adversely affect our business.\nThe Company, certain of its current and former officers and directors, and other parties have been named as defendants in a shareholder class action captioned Oklahoma Police Pension and Retirement System v. Sterling Bancorp, Inc., et al., Case No. 5:20-cv-10490-JEL-EAS, filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. This action alleges violations of the federal securities laws, primarily with respect to disclosures concerning the Bank's residential lending practices that were made in the Company's registration statement and prospectus for its initial public offering, in subsequent press releases, in periodic and other filings with the SEC, and during earnings calls. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint with the court on September 22, 2020. We will continue to incur legal fees in connection with this and potentially other cases, including expenses for the reimbursement of legal fees of present and former officers and directors under indemnification obligations. The expense of continuing to defend such litigation may be significant. We intend to defend this lawsuit, and any related actions, vigorously, but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in any defense. If the case is decided adversely, we may be liable for significant damages directly or under our indemnification obligations, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, there can be no assurance (i) that we will not incur material losses due to damages, costs and/or expenses as a result of this litigation, (ii) that our directors' and officers' insurance policy and the reserves we have established will be sufficient to cover such losses or (iii) that such losses will not materially exceed the coverage limits of our insurance and such reserves and have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Further, the amount of time that will be required to resolve this lawsuit is unpredictable and these actions together with the government investigations discussed elsewhere herein are likely to divert management's attention from the day-to-day operations of our business, which could further adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, on July 28, 2020, the Company received a demand letter from two law firms representing a purported stockholder of the Company alleging facts and claims substantially the same as many of the alleged facts and claims in the class action lawsuit. The demand letter requests that the board of directors take action to (1) recover damages the Company has purportedly sustained as a result of alleged breaches of fiduciary duties by certain of its officers and directors; (2) recover for the benefit of the Company the amounts by which certain of its officers and directors purportedly were unjustly enriched; and (3) correct alleged deficiencies in the Company's internal controls. The demand letter states that, if the board of directors has not taken the actions demanded within 90 days after the receipt of the letter, or in the event the board of directors refuses to take the actions demanded, the purported stockholder will commence a stockholder derivative action on behalf of the Company seeking appropriate relief. The board of directors has recently established a demand review committee to evaluate the matters raised in the demand letter and to determine the actions, if any, that should be taken by the Company with respect to those matters. The Company has responded to the demand letter advising the purported shareholder of the appointment of the demand review committee. There can be no assurance as to whether any litigation will be commenced by or against the Company with respect to the demand letter or that, if any such litigation is commenced, the Company will not incur material losses due to damages, penalties, costs and/or expenses as a result of such litigation or that any such losses will not have a material impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.\nThe permanent discontinuation of our Advantage Loan Program will materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nOn December 9, 2019, we voluntarily suspended our Advantage Loan Program in connection with the Internal Review, and we subsequently determined to permanently discontinue the Advantage Loan Program. While the Company will continue to work on initiatives to diversify its overall loan production\nand to review new residential loan products, the implementation of any new loan products takes time and may be subject to the prior review and approval of applicable bank regulatory authorities. We therefore expect adverse effects on our residential loan production as a result of the permanent discontinuation of the Advantage Loan Program. In addition, repayments from our loan portfolio will need to be invested in lower yielding assets until new loan programs can commence. Further, as historically a significant portion of our deposits have come from our Advantage Loan Program customers, the discontinuation of the Advantage Loan Program could result in a reduction in our deposits and have an adverse impact on our ability to generate new deposits at favorable rates, which could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity and/or profitability. Accordingly, we expect that the permanent discontinuation of the Advantage Loan Program will materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nFailure to abide by the OCC Agreement regarding our BSA/AML compliance program and credit administration, as well as risk of noncompliance and with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOn June 18, 2019, the Bank entered into the OCC Agreement, relating primarily to certain aspects of the Bank's BSA/AML compliance program and credit administration. The OCC Agreement requires the Bank to: (i) establish a compliance committee to monitor and oversee the Bank's compliance with the provisions of OCC Agreement; (ii) develop a revised customer due diligence and enhanced due diligence program; (iii) develop a revised suspicious activity monitoring program; (iv) engage an independent, third-party consultant to review and provide a written report on the Bank's suspicious activity monitoring; (v) develop revised policies and procedures to ensure effective BSA/AML model risk management for the Bank's automated suspicious activity monitoring system, which must be validated by a qualified, independent third party; (vi) ensure that the Bank's BSA Department maintains sufficient personnel; and (vii) develop revised policies and procedures to ensure effective controls over loan underwriting. In addition to these requirements, while the OCC Agreement remains in effect, the Bank is subject to certain restrictions on expansion activities, such as growth through acquisition or branching to supplement organic growth of the Bank. Further, any failure to comply with the requirements of the OCC Agreement could result in further enforcement actions, the imposition of material restrictions on the activities of the Bank, or the assessment of fines or penalties.\nThe Bank Secrecy Act, the USA Patriot Act and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program and to file timely reports such as suspicious activity reports and currency transaction reports. We are required to comply with these and other anti-money laundering requirements. The federal banking agencies and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network are authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and have recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts against banks and other financial services providers with the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration and Internal Revenue Service. We are also subject to increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control. Because a significant portion of our customer base consists of foreign nationals and recent immigrants, these laws and regulations pose disproportionate challenges to us relative to our peers. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions, which may include restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan.\nFailure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nAdditional expenses and investments have been incurred as the Bank expanded its hiring of personnel and use of outside professionals, such as consulting and legal services, and capital\ninvestments in operating systems to strengthen and support the BSA/AML compliance program, as well as the Bank's broader compliance and risk management infrastructures. The expense and capital investment associated with all of these efforts, including in connection with the OCC Agreement, have had an adverse effect on the Bank's results of operations in 2019 and is expected to have a material adverse effect on the Bank's results of operations in one or more future periods.\nFinally, due to the existence of the OCC Agreement, some counterparties may not be permitted to, due to their internal policies, or may choose not to, do business with the Bank. Should counterparties upon which the Bank relies for the conduct of their business become unwilling to do business with the Bank, the Bank's results of operations and/or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nThere is no assurance as to how long the OCC Agreement will remain in effect.\nThe Internal Review has revealed instances of the Bank's failure to comply with federal regulations governing the origination of residential mortgage loans, including rules governing the verification of a borrower's ability to repay a loan.\nAmong the many federal regulations with which we must comply in connection with the origination of residential mortgage loans is a rule issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau which requires, for loans within its scope, that a creditor must make a reasonable and good faith determination at or before consummation that the consumer will have a reasonable ability to repay the loan according to its terms. Among other requirements, a creditor must verify the information on which it bases its repayment ability determination by using reasonably reliable, written \"third-party records.\" The rule also provides that loans that meet a \"qualified mortgage\" definition will be presumed to have complied with the ability-to-repay standard. A majority of our residential mortgage loans are not \"qualified mortgages,\" as our underwriting process does not follow applicable regulatory guidance required for such qualification. The Internal Review has identified numerous instances of noncompliance with the income verification requirements under the ability to repay rules of the CFPB. We could be subject to statutory claims for violations of the ability to repay standard, as well as other laws and regulations governing the origination of residential mortgage loans. Any such claims could materially and adversely affect our ability to underwrite these loans, our business, and results of operations or financial condition.\nWe may incur future losses in connection with certain representations and warranties we have made with respect to mortgages that we have sold into the secondary market.\nFrom time to time, we package residential mortgages for sale into the secondary market while retaining the servicing rights with respect to such loans. In connection with such sales, we make representations and warranties, which, if breached, may require us to repurchase such loans, substitute other loans or indemnify the purchasers of such loans for actual losses incurred in respect of such loans. To avoid the uncertainty of audits and inquiries by third party investors in Advantage Loan Program loans sold to the secondary market, beginning at the end of the second quarter of 2020, we commenced making offers to each of those investors to repurchase 100% of our sold Advantage Loan Program loans. A substantial portion of these loans were sold to the secondary market at a slight premium to their principal balances and, as a result, we are required to repurchase such loans at that same premium which will result in a loss with respect to any repurchased loan. There can be no assurance as to the extent of any repurchases we may complete as a result of this offer and the compliance issues with respect to the origination of Advantage Loans or whether the reserves we have established with respect to such repurchase risk will be sufficient to cover potential losses we may incur in connection with such repurchases. Accordingly, it is possible that requests to repurchase loans could occur in the future and such requests may have a negative financial impact on us. In addition, the servicing agreements under which we service loans sold into the secondary market contain a number of\nrepresentations, warranties and covenants, including delivery of audited financial statements and independent audit reports regarding our servicing operations, which, if breached, could entitle the owners of the serviced loans to terminate us as servicer. Any such termination would generally result in the loss of our servicing rights with respect to the related loans. A loss of a material portion of our servicing rights could have a negative financial impact on us.\nWe have not been in compliance with Nasdaq's requirements for continued listing and as a result our common stock may be delisted from trading on Nasdaq, which would have a material effect on us and our shareholders.\nWe were delinquent in the filing of our periodic reports with the SEC as a result of additional review and procedures, including on the part of the Company's independent auditors, relating to the circumstances that led to the permanent discontinuation of the Advantage Loan Program, and the Internal Review, as a result of which we are not in compliance with the listing requirements of Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), which requires timely filing of periodic financial reports with the SEC. Under Nasdaq's listing rules, we were permitted to submit to Nasdaq a plan to regain compliance. We previously submitted such a plan to the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq, which granted us until September 14, 2020 to regain compliance. On September 15, 2020, the Company received a Staff Delisting Determination (the \"Staff Determination\") from the Listing Qualifications Department as a result of the Company being unable to meet the September 14, 2020 deadline. On September 22, 2020, the Company appealed the Staff Determination by requesting a hearing before a Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the \"Hearings Panel\") as well as a stay of delisting pending the hearing. The Hearings Panel thereafter granted the Company's request for such further stay, and the hearing has been scheduled for October 22, 2020.\nWe currently expect to file both of our delinquent Quarterly Reports with the SEC prior to the October 22, 2020 hearing before the Hearings Panel, but there is no guarantee we will be able to do so. If we are unable to make these filings in the expected timeframe, and if an adverse decision is issued by the Hearings Panel, our common stock would be subject to delisting by Nasdaq. If our common stock is delisted, there can no assurance whether or when it would again be listed for trading on Nasdaq or on any other exchange. In addition, if our common stock is delisted, the market price of our shares will likely decline and become more volatile, and our stockholders may find that their ability to trade in our stock will be adversely affected. Furthermore, institutions whose charters do not allow them to hold securities in unlisted companies might sell our shares, which could have a further adverse effect on the price of our stock.\nRisks Related to Our Highly Regulated Industry\nOur business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects could be adversely affected by the highly regulated environment and the laws and regulations that govern our operations, corporate governance, executive compensation and accounting principles, or changes in any of them.\nAs a unitary thrift holding company, we are subject to extensive examination, supervision and comprehensive regulation by various federal agencies that govern almost all aspects of our operations. These laws and regulations are not intended to protect our shareholders. Rather, these laws and regulations are intended to protect customers, depositors, the Deposit Insurance Fund (the \"DIF\") and the overall financial stability of the United States. These laws and regulations, among other matters, prescribe minimum capital requirements, impose limitations on the business activities in which we can engage, limit the dividend or distributions that Sterling Bank can pay to us, restrict the ability of institutions to guarantee our debt, and impose certain specific accounting requirements on us that may be more restrictive and may result in greater or earlier charges to earnings or reductions in our capital than generally accepted accounting principles would require. Compliance with these laws and regulations is difficult and costly, and changes to these laws and regulations often impose additional\ncompliance costs. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations, even if the failure follows good faith effort or reflects a difference in interpretation, could subject us to restrictions on our business activities, fines and other penalties, any of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, capital base and the price of our securities. Further, any new laws, rules and regulations could make compliance more difficult or expensive.\nFailure to satisfy the qualified thrift lender test may subject us to regulatory enforcement actions and restrict our ability to pay dividends.\nAs a federal savings bank, Sterling Bank must satisfy the qualified thrift lender, or \"QTL,\" test. Under the QTL test, Sterling Bank is required to maintain at least 65% of its \"portfolio assets\" (i.e., total assets less (1) specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets, (2) intangibles, including goodwill, and (3) the value of property used to conduct business) in certain \"qualified thrift investments\" (primarily mortgage loans secured by one-to-four family and multi-family residential properties and related investments, including certain mortgage-backed securities, credit card loans, student loans, and small business loans) on a monthly basis during at least 9 out of every 12 months. A savings association that fails the QTL test immediately will be prohibited from: (1) making any new investment or engaging in any new activity not permissible for a national bank, (2) paying dividends, unless such payment would be permissible for a national bank, is necessary to meet the obligations of a company that controls the savings association, and is specifically approved by the OCC and the FRB, and (3) establishing any new branch office in a location not permissible for a national bank in the association's home state. A savings association that fails to meet the QTL test is deemed to have violated the Home Owners' Loan Act and, as discussed further below, may be subject to OCC enforcement action. In addition, if a savings association does not requalify under the QTL test within three years after failing the test, the association would be prohibited from retaining any investment or engaging in any activity not permissible for a national bank.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act made noncompliance with the QTL test subject to agency enforcement action for a violation of law. At December 31, 2019, Sterling Bank satisfied the QTL test. However, if our commercial portfolio continues to grow and we are unable to replace the lost residential loan production resulting from the permanent discontinuation of our Advantage Loan Program, we may fail to maintain our QTL status in future periods. In such event, we could be forced to buy mortgage backed securities or other qualifying assets at times when the terms of such investments may not be attractive. Alternatively, we may find it necessary to pursue different structures, including converting Sterling Bank's savings bank charter to a commercial bank charter. Absent such strategies, if we fail to satisfy the QTL test, we could become subject to regulatory enforcement actions and our ability to pay dividends may be severely restricted.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act may continue to affect our business, governance structure, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, imposed new capital requirements on thrift holding companies; changed the base for FDIC insurance assessments to a bank's average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity, rather than upon its deposit base; permanently raised the current standard deposit insurance limit to $250,000; and expanded the FDIC's authority to raise insurance premiums. The Dodd-Frank Act also established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as an independent entity within the FRB, which has broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services, including deposit products, residential mortgages, home-equity loans and credit cards and contains provisions on mortgage-related matters, such as steering incentives, determinations as to a borrower's ability to repay and prepayment penalties. Although the applicability of certain elements of the Dodd-Frank Act is limited to institutions with more than $10 billion in assets, there can be no guarantee that such applicability will not be extended\nin the future or that regulators or other third parties will not seek to impose such requirements on institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, such as the Company. The Dodd-Frank Act has had and may continue to have a material impact on our operations, particularly through increased regulatory burden and compliance costs. Because the FRB has only been a primary regulator for thrift holding companies since 2012, it is unclear whether we will be exposed to additional regulatory burdens. Any future legislative changes to the Dodd-Frank Act could have a material impact on our profitability, the value of assets held for investment or the value of collateral for loans. Compliance with the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations has and will continue to result in additional operating and compliance costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nNotwithstanding the above, the enactment of EGRRCPA and the promulgation of its implementing regulations repealed or modified several important provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Among other things, EGRRCPA raises the total asset thresholds to $250 billion for Dodd-Frank Act annual company-run stress testing, leverage limits, liquidity requirements, and resolution planning requirements for bank holding companies, subject to the ability of the FRB to apply such requirements to institutions with assets of $100 billion or more to address financial stability risks or safety and soundness concerns. However, many provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that have increased our compliance costs remain in place. Certain of the provisions amended by EGRRCPA took effect immediately, while others are subject to ongoing joint agency rulemakings. It is not possible to predict when any final rules would ultimately be issued through any such rulemakings, and what the specific content of such rules will be. Although we expect to benefit from many aspects of this legislative reform, the legislation and any implementing rules that are ultimately issued could have adverse implications on the financial industry, the competitive environment, and our ability to conduct business. In addition, the federal banking agencies indicated through interagency guidance that the capital planning and risk management practices of institutions with total assets less than $100 billion would continue to be reviewed through the regular supervisory process, which may offset the impact of EGRRCPA's changes regarding stress testing and risk management.\nThe financial services industry may be subject to new legislation, regulation and governmental policy.\nIn January 2019, control of the U.S. House of Representatives was assumed by the Democratic Party. As a result, the leadership and roster of the House Financial Service Committee also shifted, resulting in a different focus for that Committee's legislative and oversight agendas. The prospects for enactment of financial services legislation this year remains uncertain, particularly given the divided control of the two chambers of Congress, and the truncated legislative calendar due to 2020 being a presidential election year. In addition, since May 2020 both the House and the U.S. Senate have passed legislation to extend and expand various provisions of the CARES Act and provide other COVID-19-related relief. It is too early to know what provisions will be in any legislation that is ultimately negotiated or enacted or when (or if) such legislation will become law. It is possible that the Democratic Party could gain control of the U.S. Senate following the 2020 election, and with such an outcome we anticipate that Congress would devote substantial attention in 2021 to consumer protection matters, through greater oversight of the CFPB's and the federal banking agencies' efforts in this area. We also anticipate that substantial attention will be given to oversight of the banking sector's role in providing coronavirus-related assistance to impacted businesses.\nIn addition, federal regulatory agencies also frequently adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are interpreted and applied. Certain aspects of current or proposed regulatory or legislative changes to laws applicable to the financial industry, if enacted or adopted, may impact the profitability of our business activities, require more oversight or change certain of our business practices, including the ability to offer products, obtain financing, attract deposits, make loans and achieve satisfactory interest spreads and could expose us to additional costs, including increased compliance costs. These changes also may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes to operations to comply and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to the Community Reinvestment Act and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to material penalties.\nThe Community Reinvestment Act (\"CRA\"), the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The CRA requires the OCC, in connection with its examination of a federally chartered savings association, to assess the institution's record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such institution. The CRA also requires all institutions to make public disclosure of their CRA ratings. The fair lending laws prohibit discrimination in the provision of banking services on the basis of prohibited factors including, among others, race, color, national origin, gender, and religion. The enforcement of these laws has been an increasing focus for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Department of Housing and Urban Development and other regulators. Under the fair lending laws, a lender may be liable for policies that result in a disparate treatment of or have a disparate impact on a protected class of applicants or borrowers. If a pattern or practice of lending discrimination is alleged by a regulator, then that agency may refer the matter to the U.S. Department of Justice for investigation. A successful challenge to an institution's performance under the CRA or fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, imposition of restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity and restrictions on expansion activity. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution's performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation.\nFederal regulators periodically examine our business, and we may be required to remediate adverse examination findings.\nThe FRB and the OCC periodically examine our business operations, including our sales practices, supervisory procedures and internal controls, recordkeeping practices and financial position, to determine our compliance with applicable laws and regulations and to protect the solvency and safety and soundness of our organization. If, as a result of an examination, a federal banking agency were to determine that our financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, interest rate risk and liquidity or other aspects of any of our operations had become unsatisfactory, or that we were in violation of any law or regulation, it may take a number of different remedial actions as it deems appropriate. These actions include, among others, the power to enjoin \"unsafe or unsound\" practices, to require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital, to restrict our growth, to assess civil monetary penalties against our officers or directors, to remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate our deposit insurance and place us into receivership or conservatorship. If we become subject to any regulatory actions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects.\nAs a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and recent rulemaking, we are subject to more stringent capital requirements.\nIn July 2013, the U.S. federal banking authorities approved new regulatory capital rules implementing the Basel III regulatory capital reforms effecting certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The new regulatory capital requirements are generally applicable to all U.S. banks as well as to unitary thrift holding companies with assets over $1 billion, such as the Company. The new regulatory capital rules not only increase most of the required minimum regulatory capital ratios, but also introduce a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio and the concept of a capital conservation buffer. The new regulatory capital rules also expand the current definition of capital by establishing additional criteria that capital instruments must meet to be considered additional Tier 1 and Tier 2\ncapital. In order to be a \"well-capitalized\" depository institution under the new regime, an institution must maintain a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5% or more; a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8% or more; a total capital ratio of 10% or more; and a leverage ratio of 5% or more. Institutions must also maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of common equity Tier 1 capital. The new regulatory capital rules became effective as applied to Sterling Bank on January 1, 2015 with the final phase-in complete as of January 1, 2019. In addition, on September 17, 2019 the FDIC finalized a rule that introduces an optional simplified measure of capital adequacy for qualifying community banking organizations (i.e., the CBLR framework), as required by the EGRRCPA. In order to qualify for the CBLR framework, a community banking organization must have (i) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of greater than 9.0%, (ii) less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, and (iii) limited amounts of off-balance-sheet exposures and trading assets and liabilities. Sterling Bank is eligible to utilize the CBLR framework but has not yet determined to do so. For additional discussion of the regulatory capital rules, see \"Item 1. Business-Supervision and Regulation-Federal Banking Regulation-Capital Requirements.\"\nThe failure to meet applicable regulatory capital requirements could result in one or more of our regulators placing limitations or conditions on our activities, including our growth initiatives, or restricting the commencement of new activities, and could materially adversely affect customer and investor confidence, our costs of funds and FDIC insurance costs, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock, our ability to make acquisitions, and our business, results of operations and financial conditions, generally.\nThe FRB or OCC may require us to commit capital resources to support Sterling Bank.\nAs a matter of policy, the FRB expects a unitary thrift holding company to act as a source of financial and managerial strength for a subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support such subsidiary bank. The Dodd-Frank Act codified the FRB's policy on serving as a source of financial strength. Under the \"source of strength\" doctrine, the FRB may require a unitary thrift holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the unitary thrift holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to a subsidiary bank. A capital injection may be required at times when the holding company may not have the resources to provide it and therefore may be required to borrow the funds or raise capital. Any loans by a holding company to its subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of the subsidiary bank. In the event of a unitary thrift's bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank. Moreover, bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of the institution's general unsecured creditors, including the holders of its note obligations. Thus, any borrowing that must be done by the Company to make a required capital injection becomes more difficult and expensive and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The requirement that we serve as a source of strength to our Bank may be exacerbated by OCC requirements to maintain certain capital requirements at the bank level and we may not be able to access the necessary funds to do so, which would further materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, and results of operations.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in the Company's internal control over financial reporting related to our control environment, including contributing factors involving our organizational structure and reporting lines and the staffing of our internal control function, as well as our identification and assessment of risks in the Advantage Loan Program. Based on the material weaknesses, our\nmanagement has determined that the Company has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019. See \"Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\" for a discussion of the Company's internal control over financial reporting and the material weaknesses.\nThe material weaknesses, or a failure to promptly remediate them, may adversely affect our business, our reputation, and our results of operations. If we are unable to remediate the material weaknesses in a timely manner, our shareholders, customers, other business partners and regulators may lose confidence in our business or our financial reports, and our access to capital markets may be adversely affected. In addition, our ability to record, process, and report financial information accurately, and to prepare financial statements within the time periods specified by the rules and regulations of the SEC and other regulatory authorities, could be adversely affected, which may result in violations of applicable securities laws, state insurance laws and regulations, and the covenants under our debt agreements. We are also exposed to lawsuits and investigations, and we could be exposed to additional legal actions. In such actions, a governmental authority may interpret a law, regulation or accounting principle differently than we have, exposing us to different or additional risks. Legal actions against us may result in payments including damages, fines, penalties, interest and other amounts assessed or awarded by courts or regulatory authorities under applicable laws and regulations. We could incur significant costs in connection with any such actions.\nIn addition, we cannot be certain that we will not identify additional control deficiencies or material weaknesses in the future. If we identify future control deficiencies or material weaknesses, these may lead to additional adverse effects on our business, our reputation, and our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, which was declared a national emergency in the United States in March 2020, continues to create extensive disruptions to the global economy and financial markets and to businesses and the lives of individuals throughout the world. Federal and state governments are taking unprecedented actions to contain the spread of the disease, including quarantines, travel bans, shelter-in-place orders, closures of businesses and schools, fiscal stimulus, and legislation designed to deliver monetary aid and other relief to businesses and individuals impacted by the pandemic. Although in various locations certain activity restrictions have been relaxed with some level of success, in many states and localities the number of individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 has increased significantly, which is causing a freezing or, in certain cases, a reversal of previously announced relaxation of activity restrictions and is prompting the need for additional aid and other forms of relief.\nThe governmental and social response to the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented slow-down in economic activity and a related increase in unemployment. Since the outbreak of COVID-19 in the United States, more than 50 million people nationwide have filed claims for unemployment, and stock markets have declined in value and in particular, bank stocks have significantly declined in value. As of the end of June 2020, the national unemployment rate was 11.1%. Although an improvement from the 14.7% national unemployment rate observed in April 2020, the current rate of unemployment is substantially higher than the 3.6% national unemployment rate observed in January 2020 prior to the outbreak of COVID-19 in the United States. Further, the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation, which under Section 2104 of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \"CARES Act\") allows for additional payments to covered individuals of up to $600 per week, expired as of July 31, 2020 and it is uncertain whether this benefit will be renewed by Congress.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, and related efforts to contain it, have caused significant disruptions in the functioning of the financial markets and have increased economic and market uncertainty and volatility. To help address these issues, the Federal Open Market Committee (\"FOMC\") has reduced the benchmark federal funds rate to a target range of 0% to 0.25%, and the yields on 10 and 30-year treasury notes have declined to historic lows. At its June and July meetings, the FOMC continued its commitment to this approach, indicating that the target federal funds rate would remain at current levels until the economy is in position to achieve the FOMC's maximum-employment and price-stability goals. In addition, in order to support the flow of credit to households and businesses, the FRB indicated that it will continue to increase its holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and agency residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities to sustain proper functioning of the financial markets.\nCongress and various state governments and federal agencies have taken actions to require lenders to provide forbearance and other relief to borrowers (e.g., waiving late payment and other fees). The federal banking agencies have encouraged financial institutions to prudently work with affected borrowers and recently passed legislation has provided relief from reporting loan classifications due to modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic. More specifically, through Section 4022 of the CARES Act, Congress provided relief to borrowers with federally-backed one-to-four family mortgage loans experiencing a financial hardship due to COVID-19 by allowing such borrowers to request forbearance, regardless of delinquency status, for up to 360 days. Such relief will be available until the earlier of December 31, 2020 and the date of termination of the national emergency declaration. Section 4022 of the CARES Act also prohibits servicers of federally-backed mortgage loans from initiating foreclosures during the 60-day period beginning March 18, 2020. In addition, under Section 4023 of the CARES Act, until the earlier of December 31, 2020 and the date of termination of the national emergency declaration, borrowers with federally-backed multifamily mortgage loans whose payments were current as of February 1, 2020, but who have since experienced financial hardship due to COVID-19, may request a forbearance for up to 90 days. Borrowers receiving such forbearance may not evict or charge late fees to tenants for its duration.\nAdditionally, in many states in which we do business or in which our borrowers and loan collateral are located, temporary bans on evictions and foreclosures have been enacted through a mix of executive orders, regulations, and judicial orders. Certain such relief orders have since expired, although several states, including California, New York and New Jersey, have extended their temporary orders and may continue to do so indefinitely. In addition, in New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo signed legislation on June 17, 2020 that expands mortgage forbearance available for those experiencing financial hardship during the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The legislation applies to those who have mortgages with state-regulated financial institutions and is intended to be an expansion of the CARES Act's mortgage forbearance provisions. The legislation provides up to one year of forbearance if the borrower's hardship persists and provides flexible payment options. Furthermore, on August 31, 2020, the California Legislature passed legislation extending an existing moratorium on evictions through January 31, 2021, provided that renters pay a portion of their rent for the period between September 1, 2020 and January 31, 2021. The legislation also requires servicers of residential mortgages, including those on real property containing up to four dwelling units, to comply with certain standards when notifying and communicating with borrowers who have experienced a COVID-19-related financial hardship and may be pursuing forbearances or other loss mitigation options.\nCertain industries have been particularly hard-hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, including the travel and hospitality industry, the restaurant industry and the retail industry. Although we do not have a material concentration in the restaurant and retail industries, at December 31, 2019, we had $81.8 million of loans to hotels and single-room occupancy hotels in our commercial real estate loan portfolio. In addition, the spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices, including employee travel, employee work locations, and cancellation of physical participation in\nmeetings, events and conferences. We have many employees working remotely and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers and business partners.\nGiven the ongoing, dynamic and unprecedented nature of our current circumstances, it is difficult to predict the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. The extent of such impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, including when the coronavirus can be controlled and abated and when and how the economy may be reopened. As the result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related adverse local and national economic consequences, we may be subject to any of the following risks, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, risk-weighted assets and regulatory capital:\n\u2022 because the incidence of reported COVID-19 cases and related hospitalizations and deaths varies significantly by state and locality, the economic downturn caused by the pandemic may be deeper and more sustained in certain areas, including those in which we do business, relative to other areas of the country;\n\u2022 our ability to market our products and services may be impaired by a variety of external factors, including a prolonged reduction in economic activity and continued economic and financial market volatility, which could cause demand for our products and services to decline, in turn making it difficult for us to grow assets and income;\n\u2022 if the economy is unable to substantially reopen and high levels of unemployment continue for an extended period of time, loan delinquencies, problem assets, and foreclosures may increase, resulting in increased charges and reduced income;\n\u2022 collateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, which may reduce our ability to liquidate such collateral and could cause loan losses to increase and impair our ability over the long run to maintain our targeted loan origination volume;\n\u2022 our allowance for loan losses may have to be increased if borrowers experience financial difficulties beyond forbearance periods, which will adversely affect our net income;\n\u2022 an increase in non-performing loans due to the COVID-19 pandemic would result in a corresponding increase in the risk-weighting of assets and therefore an increase in required regulatory capital;\n\u2022 the net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us;\n\u2022 as the result of the reduction of the FRB's target federal funds rate to near 0%, the yield on our assets may decline to a greater extent than the decline in our cost of interest-bearing liabilities, reducing our net interest margin and spread and reducing net income;\n\u2022 deposits could decline if customers need to draw on available balances as a result of the economic downturn;\n\u2022 a material decrease in net income or a net loss over several quarters could result in a decrease in the rate of our quarterly cash dividend;\n\u2022 we face heightened cybersecurity risk in connection with our operation of a remote working environment, which risks include, among others, greater phishing, malware, and other cybersecurity attacks, vulnerability to disruptions of our information technology infrastructure and telecommunications systems, increased risk of unauthorized dissemination of confidential information, limited ability to restore our systems in the event of a systems failure or interruption, greater risk of a security breach resulting in destruction or misuse of valuable information, and potential impairment of our ability to perform critical functions-all of which\ncould expose us to risks of data or financial loss, litigation and liability and could seriously disrupt our operations and the operations of any impacted customers;\n\u2022 we rely on third party vendors for certain services and the unavailability of a critical service or limitations on the business capacities of our vendors for extended periods of time due to the COVID-19 pandemic could have an adverse effect on our operations; and\n\u2022 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, there may be unexpected developments in financial markets, legislation, regulations and consumer and customer behavior.\nOur senior management has recently undergone a significant transition and our future success depends on our ability to identify, attract and retain key executives and other qualified personnel in the current environment.\nThe Company experienced significant executive transitions in late 2019 continuing through the first half of 2020. On October 17, 2019, the Company announced the retirement of its then-Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Gary Judd, with such retirement to be effective November 30, 2019. On October 15, 2019, the board of directors appointed Thomas Lopp, the Company's then-President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer, to assume the role of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman effective upon Mr. Judd's retirement. The board of directors also appointed Stephen Huber as Chief Financial Officer, also effective November 30, 2019. On May 7, 2020, Mr. Lopp resigned from each of his positions with the Company and the board of directors appointed Mr. Huber as interim Chief Executive Officer. On May 29, 2020, Michael Montemayor was terminated from his positions as President of Commercial and Retail Banking and Chief Lending Officer. Effective June 3, 2020, the Company and the Bank appointed Thomas M. O'Brien as Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and the Bank, respectively. Mr. Huber continued in his role as Chief Financial Officer following the appointment of Mr. O'Brien. Christine Meredith was hired by the Bank in the role of Senior Vice President and Chief Risk Officer with a starting date of February 3, 2020. Since October 1, 2019, more than 100 officers and employees have been terminated or have resigned, including more than 35 loan officers.\nWe may not be successful in retaining our key employees, or replacing recently terminated or departed employees, and the unexpected loss of services of one or more of our officers or directors could have a material adverse effect on our business because of their skills, knowledge of our market and financial products, years of industry experience and the difficulty of finding qualified replacement personnel. We recognize that the banking industry is competitive and replacing executive officers and key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to successfully manage, develop and grow in the banking industry. If we fail to identify and develop or recruit successors, we are at risk of being harmed by the departures of key employees.\nOur concentration in residential mortgage loans exposes us to risks.\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, one-to-four family residential real estate loans amounted to $2.48 billion and $2.45 billion, or 85% and 84%, respectively, of our total loan portfolio, and we intend to continue this type of lending in the foreseeable future. Residential mortgage lending is generally sensitive to regional and local economic conditions that significantly impact the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations, making loss levels difficult to predict. If borrowers are unable to meet their loan repayment obligations, our results of operations would be materially and adversely affected. In addition, a decline in residential real estate values as a result of a downturn in the markets we serve would reduce the value of the real estate collateral securing these types of loans. Declines in real estate values could cause some of our residential mortgages to be inadequately collateralized,\nwhich would expose us to a great risk of loss if we seek to recover on defaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral.\nOur results of operations are dependent on our loan production. Recent terminations and departures of high producing loan officers may materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur business and ability to generate loans depends on the efforts of our loan producers. Since October 1, 2019, more than 100 officers and employees have been terminated or have resigned, including more than 35 loan officers. If we are unable to maintain the clients of these producers, hire effective new producers, or replace their production through other loan officers and loan products, our results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nStrong competition within our market areas or with respect to our products may limit our growth and profitability.\nCompetition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. In our market area, we compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, brokerage and investment banking firms and unregulated or less regulated non-banking entities, operating locally and elsewhere. Many of these competitors have substantially greater resources and higher lending limits than we have and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide. In addition, some of our competitors offer loans with lower interest rates on more attractive terms than loans we offer. Competition also makes it increasingly difficult and costly to attract and retain qualified employees. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market areas. If we must raise interest rates paid on deposits or lower interest rates charged on our loans, our net interest margin and profitability could be adversely affected. As we expand into new market areas, we expect that competition for customers and relationships will be intense. As a result, our ability to successfully deploy our business strategy in these market areas may be difficult.\nIn addition, we believe that we have historically faced less competition for customers of our Advantage Loan Program as compared to the competition we face in the market for qualified mortgages. Due to the permanent discontinuation of this Program, we may face significant pricing pressure and may experience a negative effect on our net interest margin. Many of our competitors are much larger and may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer better pricing for the type of products and services we provide. Should competition over the type of loans we underwrite increase, our profitability could be materially and adversely affected. See \"Item 1. Business-Competition.\"\nWe face significant operational risks because the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions and increased reliance on technology, including risk of loss related to cybersecurity breaches.\nWe operate in diverse markets and rely on the ability of our employees and systems to process a high number of transactions and to collect, process, transmit and store significant amounts of confidential information regarding our customers, employees and others, as well as our own business, operations, plans and strategies. Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from our operations, including but not limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside our company, the execution of unauthorized transactions, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, systems failures or interruptions, breaches of our internal control systems and compliance requirements, and business continuation and disaster recovery. We face an increasing number of regulations and regulatory scrutiny related to our information technology systems, and security or privacy breaches with respect to our data could result in regulatory fines, reputational harm and customer losses, any of which would significantly impact our financial condition. As cybersecurity threats are inherently difficult to predict and can take many forms, insurance coverage may not be available for losses associated with\ncyber-attacks or information security breaches, or where available, such losses may exceed insurance limits. In addition, because we perform our own core processing and other technological functions, we cannot rely on indemnification or another source of third-party recovery in the event of a breach of such functions.\nIn recent years, several U.S. financial institutions have experienced significant distributed denial-of-service attacks, some of which involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems. Other potential attacks have attempted to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information or destroy data, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyber-attacks and other means. To date and to the best of our knowledge, none of these types of attacks have had a material effect on our business or operations. Such security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including persons who are involved with organized crime or who may be linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. Those same parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers or clients. We are also subject to the risk that our employees may intercept and transmit unauthorized confidential or proprietary information. An interception, misuse or mishandling of personal, confidential or proprietary information being sent to or received from a customer or third party could result in legal liability, remediation costs, regulatory action and reputational harm.\nIn addition, we outsource some of our data processing to certain third-party providers. If these third-party providers encounter difficulties, including as a result of cyber-attacks or information security breaches, or if we have difficulty communicating with them, our ability to adequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and our business operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nAlthough we have implemented and intend to continue to implement and enhance security technology and establish operational procedures to prevent such damage, there can be no assurance that these security measures will be successful in deterring or mitigating the effects of every cyberthreat that we face. In addition, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms we and our third-party service providers use to protect client transaction data, other customer data and employee data. Any successful cyber-attack or other information security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer information or that compromises our ability to function could severely damage our reputation, erode confidence in the security of our systems, products and services, expose us to the risk of litigation and liability, disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business. Any successful cyber-attack may also subject the Company to regulatory investigations, litigation or enforcement, or require the payment of regulatory fines or penalties or undertaking costly remediation efforts with respect to third parties affected by a cyber security incident, all or any of which could adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations and damage its reputation.\nA lack of liquidity could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and result in regulatory limits being placed on the Company.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. We rely on our ability to generate deposits and effectively manage the repayment and maturity schedules of our loans to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to fund our operations. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our most important source of funds is deposits. Deposit balances can decrease when customers perceive alternative investments as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. If customers move money out of deposits such as money market funds, we would lose a relatively low-cost source of funds, increasing our funding costs and reducing our net interest income and net income. In addition, should secondary market investors accept our\noffers to repurchase Advantage Loans with respect to a substantial portion of such outstanding loans, the cash required to fund these repurchases will substantially reduce our excess liquidity. Moreover, depending on the capitalization and regulatory treatment of depository institutions, including whether an institution is subject to a supervisory prompt corrective action directive, certain additional regulatory restrictions and prohibitions may apply, including restrictions on growth, restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, restrictions or prohibitions on payment of dividends, and restrictions on the acceptance of brokered deposits. In the event such restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits become applicable to us, we will likely need to reduce our interest rates paid on a large segment of our deposits, which could result in significant deposit withdrawals. In addition, as of December 31, 2019, approximately 17.3% of our total deposits are not FDIC-insured, and a significant portion of those deposits could be withdrawn in the event of volatile economic conditions. Significant deposit withdrawals could materially reduce our liquidity, and, in such an event, we may be required to replace such deposits with higher-costing borrowings. See \"Item 1. Business-Supervision and Regulation-Federal Banking Regulation-Capital Requirements\" and \"Item 1. Business-Supervision and Regulation-Federal Banking Regulation-Prompt Corrective Action.\"\nOther primary sources of funds consist of cash flows from operations and sales of investment securities, and proceeds from the issuance and sale of our equity securities, including, most recently, net proceeds of approximately $85.5 million from our 2017 initial public offering. Additional liquidity is provided by our ability to borrow from the FHLB of Indianapolis or our ability to sell portions of our loan portfolio. We also may borrow funds from third-party lenders, such as other financial institutions. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our activities, or on terms that are acceptable to us, could be impaired by factors that affect us directly or the financial services industry or economy in general, such as disruptions in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry. Our access to funding sources could also be affected by a decrease in the ability to sell mortgage portfolios as a result of a downturn in our markets or by one or more adverse regulatory actions against us. A lack of liquidity could also attract increased regulatory scrutiny and potential restraints imposed on us by regulators.\nAny decline in available funding could adversely impact our ability to originate loans, invest in securities, meet our expenses, or to fulfill obligations such as repaying our borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on external financing to fund our operations and the failure to obtain such financing on favorable terms, or at all, in the future could materially and adversely impact our growth strategy and prospects.\nWe rely in part on advances from the FHLB, subordinated debt, and brokered deposits to fund our operations. Although we consider such sources of funds adequate for our current needs, we may need to seek additional debt or equity capital in the future to restore capital that may be depleted due to losses related to adverse results from government investigations and ligations, adverse economic conditions due to COVID 19 and other risks identified herein, as well as to fund future growth. The sale of equity or equity-related securities in the future may be dilutive to our shareholders, and debt financing arrangements may require us to pledge some of our assets and enter into various affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on operational activities and financing alternatives. Future financing sources, if sought, might be unavailable to us or, if available, could be on terms unfavorable to us and may require regulatory approval. If financing sources are unavailable or are not available on favorable terms or we are unable to obtain regulatory approval, our capital base, growth strategy and future prospects could be materially and adversely impacted.\nAs a business operating in the financial services industry, our business and operations may be adversely affected in numerous and complex ways by weak economic conditions.\nOur business and operations, which primarily consist of lending money to customers in the form of loans, borrowing money from customers in the form of deposits and investing in securities, are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the United States. If the U.S. economy weakens, our growth and profitability from our lending, deposit and investment operations could be constrained. Uncertainty about the federal fiscal policymaking process, the medium and long-term fiscal outlook of the federal government, and future tax rates is a concern for businesses, consumers and investors in the United States. In addition, economic conditions in foreign countries, including uncertainty over the stability of the euro currency, could affect the stability of global financial markets, which could hinder U.S. economic growth. Weak economic conditions are characterized by deflation, fluctuations in debt and equity capital markets, a lack of liquidity and/or depressed prices in the secondary market for mortgage loans, increased delinquencies on mortgage, consumer and commercial loans, residential and commercial real estate price declines and lower home sales and commercial activity. The current economic environment is also characterized by interest rates at historically low levels, which impacts our ability to attract deposits and to generate attractive earnings through our investment portfolio. All of these factors are detrimental to our business, and the interplay between these factors can be complex and unpredictable. Our business is also significantly affected by monetary and related policies of the U.S. federal government and its agencies. Changes in any of these policies are influenced by macroeconomic conditions and other factors that are beyond our control. Adverse economic conditions and government policy responses to such conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur business is affected by changes in the state of the general economy and the financial markets, and a slowdown or downturn in the general economy or the financial markets could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur customer activity is intrinsically linked to the health of the economy generally and of the financial markets specifically. In addition to the economic factors discussed above, a downturn in the real estate or commercial markets generally could cause our customers and potential customers to exit the market for real estate or commercial loans. As a result, we believe that fluctuations, disruptions, instability or downturns in the general economy and the financial markets could disproportionately affect demand for our residential and commercial loan services. If such conditions occur and persist, our business and financial results, including our liquidity and our ability to fulfill our debt obligations, could be materially adversely affected.\nChanges in economic conditions could cause an increase in delinquencies and nonperforming assets, including loan charge offs, which could depress our net income and growth.\nOur loan portfolio includes primarily real estate secured loans, demand for which may decrease during economic downturns as a result of, among other things, an increase in unemployment, a decrease in real estate values and a slowdown in housing. If we see negative economic conditions develop in the United States as a whole or in the markets that we serve, we could experience higher delinquencies and loan charge offs, which would reduce our net income and adversely affect our financial condition. Furthermore, to the extent that real estate collateral is obtained through foreclosure, the costs of holding and marketing the real estate collateral, as well as the ultimate values obtained from disposition, could reduce our earnings and adversely affect our financial condition.\nBecause we intend to continue to increase our commercial loans, our credit risk may increase in our commercial loan portfolios.\nAt December 31, 2019, our commercial loans totaled $436.4 million, or 15% of our total loans. As a result of the permanent discontinuation of the Advantage Loan Program, we expect this percentage to materially increase. We intend to increase our originations of commercial loans, within permissible limits for a federal savings bank, which primarily consists of commercial real estate, construction and development, business loans, and commercial lines of credit. These loans generally have more risk than residential mortgage loans.\nBecause we plan to continue to increase our originations of these loans, commercial loans generally have a larger average size as compared with other loans such as residential loans. The collateral for commercial loans is generally less readily-marketable and losses incurred on a small number of commercial loans could have a disproportionate and material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nMonetary policies and regulations of the FRB could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to being affected by general economic conditions, our earnings and growth are affected by the policies of the FRB. An important function of the FRB is to regulate the money supply and credit conditions. Among the instruments used by the FRB to implement these objectives are open market purchases and sales of U.S. government securities, adjustments of the discount rate and changes in banks' reserve requirements against bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.\nThe monetary policies and regulations of the FRB have had a significant effect on the operating results of banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The effects of such policies upon our business, financial condition and results of operations cannot be predicted.\nInterest rate shifts may reduce net interest income and otherwise negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe majority of our banking assets are monetary in nature and subject to risk from changes in interest rates. Like most financial institutions, our earnings and cash flows depend to a great extent upon the level of our net interest income, or the difference between the interest income we earn on loans, investments and other interest earning assets, and the interest we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Changes in interest rates can increase or decrease our net interest income, because different types of assets and liabilities may react differently, and at different times, to market interest rate changes.\nWhen interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly, or to a greater degree than interest earning assets in a period, an increase in interest rates could reduce net interest income. Similarly, when interest earning assets mature or reprice more quickly, or to a greater degree than interest-bearing liabilities, falling interest rates could reduce net interest income. Additionally, an increase in interest rates may, among other things, reduce the demand for loans and our ability to originate loans and decrease loan repayment rates. A decrease in the general level of interest rates may affect us through, among other things, increased prepayments on our loan portfolio. Accordingly, changes in the level of market interest rates affect our net yield on interest earning assets, loan origination volume and our overall results. Although our asset-liability management strategy is designed to control and mitigate exposure to the risks related to changes in market interest rates, those rates are affected by many factors outside of our control, including governmental monetary policies, inflation,\ndeflation, recession, changes in unemployment, the money supply, international disorder and instability in domestic and foreign financial markets.\nFuture changes in interest rates could reduce our profits and asset values.\nNet interest income makes up a majority of our income and is based on the difference between:\n\u2022 the interest income we earn on interest earning assets, such as loans and securities; and\n\u2022 the interest expense we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings.\nThe rates we earn on our assets and the rates we pay on our liabilities are generally fixed for a contractual period of time. Like many savings institutions, our liabilities generally have shorter contractual maturities than our assets. This imbalance can create significant earnings volatility because market interest rates change over time. In a period of rising interest rates, the demand for our residential lending products may decline and the interest income we earn on our assets may not increase as rapidly as the interest we pay on our liabilities. In a period of declining interest rates, the interest income we earn on our assets may decrease more rapidly than the interest we pay on our liabilities, as borrowers prepay mortgage loans, and mortgage-backed securities and callable investment securities are called, requiring us to reinvest those cash flows at lower interest rates. Such changes in interest rates could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and overall profitability.\nIn addition, changes in interest rates can affect the average life of loans and mortgage-backed and related securities. A decline in interest rates results in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed and related securities as borrowers refinance their debt to reduce their borrowing costs. This creates reinvestment risk, which is the risk that we may not be able to reinvest prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates we earned on the prepaid loans or securities. Furthermore, an inverted interest rate yield curve, where short-term interest rates (which are usually the rates at which financial institutions borrow funds) are higher than long-term interest rates (which are usually the rates at which financial institutions lend funds for fixed-rate loans) can reduce our net interest margin and create financial risk for financial institutions like ours.\nA continuation of the historically low interest rate environment and the possibility that we may access higher-cost funds to support our loan growth and operations may adversely affect our net interest income and profitability.\nIn prior years the FRB's policy has been to maintain interest rates at historically low levels through its targeted federal funds rate and the purchase of mortgage-backed securities. After steadily increasing the target federal funds rate in 2018 and 2017, the FRB in 2019 decreased the target federal funds rate by 75 basis points, and in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, decreased the target federal funds rate by an additional 150 basis points to a range of 0.0% to 0.25% as of March 31, 2020. The FRB could make additional changes in interest rates during 2020 subject to economic conditions. If the FRB increases the target federal funds rate, overall interest rates will likely rise, which may negatively impact the housing markets and the U.S. economic recovery. Our ability to reduce our interest expense may be limited at current interest rate levels while the average yield on our interest-earning assets may continue to decrease, and our interest expense may increase as we access non-core funding sources or increase deposit rates to fund our operations. A continuation of a low, or relatively low, interest rate environment or increasing our cost of funds may adversely affect our net interest income, which would have a material adverse effect on our profitability.\nUncertainty relating to the LIBOR calculation process and potential phasing out of LIBOR may adversely affect our results of operations.\nLIBOR is the reference rate used for many of our transactions, including our lending and borrowing and our purchase and sale of securities, as well as the derivatives that we use to manage risk related to such transactions. However, a reduced volume of interbank unsecured term borrowing coupled with recent legal and regulatory proceedings related to rate manipulation by certain financial institutions has led to international reconsideration of LIBOR as a financial benchmark. The United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\"), which regulates the process for establishing LIBOR, announced in July 2017 that the sustainability of LIBOR cannot be guaranteed. Accordingly, the FCA intends to stop persuading, or compelling, banks to submit to LIBOR after 2021. Until such time, however, FCA panel banks have agreed to continue to support LIBOR.\nWe have not yet determined which alternative rate is most applicable, and there can be no assurances on which benchmark rate(s) may replace LIBOR or how LIBOR will be determined for purposes of financial instruments that are currently referencing LIBOR if and when it ceases to exist. If LIBOR is discontinued after 2021 as expected, there may be uncertainty or differences in the calculation of the applicable interest rate or payment amount depending on the terms of the governing instruments, and such discontinuation may increase operational and other risks to the Company and the industry.\nWhile there is no consensus on what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, a group of large banks, the Alternative Reference Rate Committee, or ARRC, selected the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") as an alternative to LIBOR. SOFR has been published by the FRBNY since May 2018, and it is intended to be a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities. The FRBNY reports that SOFR includes all trades in the Broad General Collateral Rate, plus bilateral U.S. Treasury repurchase agreement transactions cleared through the delivery-versus-payment service offered by the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, a subsidiary of the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation.\nThe Federal Reserve Bank of New York (\"FRBNY\") currently publishes SOFR daily on its website at https://apps.newyorkfed.org/markets/autorates/sofr. The FRBNY states on its publication page for SOFR that use of SOFR is subject to important disclaimers, limitations and indemnification obligations, including that the FRBNY may alter the methods of calculation, publication schedule, rate revision practices or availability of SOFR at any time without notice.\nBecause SOFR is published by the FRBNY based on data received from other sources, the Bank has no control over its determination, calculation or publication. There can be no assurance that SOFR will not be discontinued or fundamentally altered in a manner that is materially adverse to the parties that utilize SOFR as the reference rate for transactions. There is no assurance that SOFR will be widely adopted as the replacement reference rate for LIBOR (or that the Company will ultimately decide to adopt SOFR as the reference rate for its lending or borrowing transactions).\nThe market transition away from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate, including SOFR, is complex and could have a range of adverse effects on the Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations. In particular, any such transition could:\n\u2022 adversely affect the interest rates paid or received on, and the revenue and expenses associated with, the Company's floating rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates, or other securities or financial arrangements given LIBOR's role in determining market interest rates globally;\n\u2022 adversely affect the value of the Company's floating rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates, or other securities or financial arrangements given LIBOR's role in determining market interest rates globally;\n\u2022 prompt inquiries or other actions from regulators in respect of the Company's preparation and readiness for the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate;\n\u2022 result in disputes, litigation or other actions with counterparties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language in LIBOR-based securities; and\n\u2022 require the transition to or development of appropriate systems and analytics to effectively transition our risk management processes from LIBOR-based products to those based on the applicable alternative pricing benchmark.\nIn addition, the implementation of LIBOR reform proposals may result in increased compliance costs and operational costs, including costs related to continued participation in LIBOR and the transition to a replacement reference rate or rates. We cannot reasonably estimate the expected cost.\nThe FASB has issued an accounting standard update that will result in a significant change in how we provide for credit losses and may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which replaces the current \"incurred loss\" model for recognizing credit losses with an \"expected loss\" model referred to as the Current Expected Credit Loss (\"CECL\") model. Under the CECL model, we will be required to present certain financial assets carried at amortized cost, such as loans held for investment and held-to-maturity debt securities, at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is to be based on information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. This measurement will take place at the time the financial asset is first added to the balance sheet and periodically thereafter. This differs significantly from the current \"incurred loss\" model, which delays recognition until it is probable a loss has been incurred. Accordingly, we expect that the adoption of the CECL model will materially affect how we determine our allowance for loan losses and could require us to significantly increase our allowance for loan losses. Moreover, the CECL model may create more volatility in the level of our allowance for loan losses. If we are required to materially increase our level of allowance for loan losses for any reason, such increase could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe new CECL standard will be effective on January 1, 2023 for the Company. We are currently evaluating the impact the CECL model will have on our accounting, but we expect to recognize a one-time cumulative-effect adjustment to our allowance for loan losses as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the new standard is effective, consistent with regulatory expectations set forth in interagency guidance issued at the end of 2016. We cannot yet determine the magnitude of any such one-time cumulative adjustment or of the overall impact of the new standard on our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur accounting estimates and risk management processes and controls rely on analytical and forecasting techniques and models and assumptions, which may not accurately predict future events.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Our management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods so they comply with U.S. GAAP and reflect management's judgment of the most appropriate manner in which to report our financial condition and results. In some cases, management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives, any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances, yet which may result in our reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative.\nCertain accounting policies are critical to presenting our financial condition and results of operations. They require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain. Materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates. These critical accounting policies include the allowance for loan losses, the fair value of financial instruments and the valuation of mortgage servicing rights. Because of the uncertainty of estimates involved in these matters, we may be required to significantly increase the allowance for loan losses or sustain loan losses that are significantly higher than the reserve provided or reduce the carrying value of an asset measured at fair value. Any of these could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. See \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\"\nOur internal controls, disclosure controls, processes and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures are based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable (not absolute) assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls, processes and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls, processes and procedures could necessitate changes in those controls, processes and procedures, which may increase our compliance costs, divert management attention from our business or subject us to regulatory actions and increased regulatory scrutiny. Any of these could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf the allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, earnings could decrease.\nLoan customers may not repay their loans according to the terms of their loans, and the collateral securing the payment of their loans may be insufficient to assure repayment. We may experience significant credit losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of the loan portfolio are made, including the creditworthiness of borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, management reviews the loans and the loss and delinquency experience and evaluates economic conditions.\nAt December 31, 2019, our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 0.75%. The determination of the appropriate level of allowance for loan losses is subject to judgment and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which are subject to material changes. If assumptions prove to be incorrect, the allowance for loan losses may not cover incurred losses in the loan portfolio at the date of the financial statements. Significant additions to the allowance for loan losses would materially decrease net income. Nonperforming loans may increase and nonperforming or delinquent loans may adversely affect future performance. In addition, federal regulators periodically review the allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge offs. Any significant increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge offs as required by these regulatory agencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nTax matters, including the changes in corporate tax rates, disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to regular reviews, examinations, and audits by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities with respect to our taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken, we could face additional tax liability, including interest and penalties. There can be no assurance that payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes will not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.\nLikewise, the Company operates in an environment that imposes income taxes on its operations at both the federal and state levels to varying degrees. Changes in tax laws could significantly affect our financial position and results of operations. In addition, we are subject to regular review and audit by U.S. federal and certain state authorities. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nA substantial majority of our loans and operations are in California, and therefore our business is particularly vulnerable to a downturn in the local economies in which we operate.\nUnlike larger financial institutions that are more geographically diversified, a large portion of our business is concentrated primarily in the state of California, specifically in the San Francisco Bay and Los Angeles Areas. As of December 31, 2019, 89% of our loan portfolio was based in California and our loan portfolio had concentrations of 54% and 35% in the San Francisco Bay and Los Angeles Areas, respectively. While there is not a single employer or industry in our market areas on which a significant number of our customers are dependent, if the local economies, and particularly the real estate market, declines, the rates of delinquencies, defaults, foreclosures, bankruptcies and losses in our loan portfolio would likely increase. Notably, the COVID-19 pandemic has had, and likely will continue to have, a significant effect on the California real estate market. In response to this crisis, California lawmakers have adopted legislation and other orders requiring us to take, or refrain from taking, certain action to assist borrowers who have experienced a COVID-19-related financial hardship, including by offering forbearance and other loss mitigation options and delaying foreclosure proceedings. Similarly, catastrophic natural events such as earthquakes or wildfires could have a disproportionate effect on our financial condition. As a result of this lack of diversification in our loan portfolio, a downturn in the local economies generally and real estate market specifically could significantly reduce our profitability and growth and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe face strong competition in the banking industry, and we may not be able to successfully grow or retain market share in our existing markets.\nWe face intense competition in the banking industry from many competitors who compete with us on an international, regional or local level. Our strategy for future growth relies in part on growth in the communities we serve and our ability to develop relationships in particular locations, and we expect to continue to face strong competition from competitors in all of our markets. In addition, our competitors may seek to benefit from the recent negative publicity surrounding our permanent discontinuation of the Advantage Loan Program and target our customers. If we fail to compete effectively against our competitors, we may be unable to expand our market share in our existing markets, and we may be unable to retain our existing market share in key growth markets or in those markets in which we have traditionally had a strong presence. Failure to protect our market share on a regional level or to grow our market share in key growth markets and product categories could have a material adverse effect on our overall market share and on our profitability.\nThe value of our mortgage servicing rights can be volatile.\nWe sell in the secondary market residential mortgage loans that we originate, which provides a meaningful portion of our non-interest income in the form of gains on the sale of mortgage loans. We also earn revenue from fees we receive for servicing mortgage loans. As a result of our mortgage servicing business, we have a portfolio of mortgage servicing rights. A mortgage servicing right is the right to service a mortgage loan-collect principal, interest, and escrow amounts-for a fee. We acquire mortgage servicing rights when we keep the servicing rights in connection with the sale of loans we have originated.\nChanges in interest rates may impact our mortgage servicing revenues, which could negatively impact our non-interest income. When rates rise, net revenue from our mortgage servicing activities can increase due to slower prepayments, which reduces our amortization expense for mortgage servicing rights. When rates fall, the value of our mortgage servicing rights usually tends to decline as a result of a higher volume of prepayments, resulting in a decline in our net revenue. It is possible that, because of economic conditions and/or a weak or deteriorating housing market, even if interest rates were to fall or remain low, mortgage originations may also fall or any increase in mortgage originations may not be enough to offset the decrease in the mortgage servicing rights value caused by the lower rates. Because the value of our mortgage servicing rights is recorded on our balance sheet and evaluated on a quarterly basis, any significant decline in value could adversely affect our income, our capital ratios or require us to raise additional capital, which may not be available on favorable terms.\nOne of our historical markets, minority and immigrant individuals, may be threatened by gentrification or adverse political developments, which could decrease our growth and profitability.\nWe believe that a significant part of our historical strength has been our focus on the minority and immigrant markets. The continuing displacement of minorities due to gentrification of our communities may adversely affect us unless we are able to adapt and increase the acceptance of our products and services by non-minority customers. We may also be unfavorably impacted by political developments adverse to the United States and specifically adverse to markets that are dependent on immigrant populations. We may be further limited in our ability to attract immigrant clients to the extent the U.S. adopts restrictive domestic immigration laws. Changes to U.S. immigration policies as proposed that restrain the flow of immigrants may inhibit our ability to meet our goals and budgets for non-qualified mortgage loans and deposits, which may adversely affect our net interest income and net income.\nWe depend on the accuracy and completeness of information provided by customers and counterparties.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers and counterparties, we may rely on information furnished to us by, or on behalf of, customers and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. We also may rely on representations of customers and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. In deciding whether to extend credit, we may rely upon our customers' representations that their financial statements are accurate. We also may rely on customer representations and certifications, or other audit or accountants' reports, with respect to the business and financial condition of our commercial clients. Our financial condition, results of operations, financial reporting and reputation could be materially adversely affected if we rely on materially misleading, false, inaccurate or fraudulent information.\nWe could be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions and other third parties we rely on.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks and other institutional entities. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when our collateral cannot be foreclosed upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due.\nWe are a community bank and our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance.\nWe are a community bank, and our reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business. Recent negative publicity regarding the Advantage Loan Program may cause substantial damage to our reputation in the communities we serve. While we will seek to restore any such damage, in part, by recruiting, hiring and retaining employees who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities we serve, and delivering superior service to our customers and caring about our customers and associates, we cannot assure you these efforts will be successful. If our reputation continues to be negatively affected by the actions of our former employees, by our inability to conduct our operations in a manner that is appealing to current or prospective customers, or otherwise, our business and, therefore, our operating results may be materially adversely affected.\nIf our enterprise risk management framework is not effective at mitigating risk and loss to us, we could suffer unexpected losses and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur enterprise risk management framework seeks to achieve an appropriate balance between risk and return, which is critical to optimizing shareholder value. We have established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report and analyze the types of risk to which we are subject, including credit, liquidity, operational, regulatory compliance and reputational. However, as with any risk management framework, there are inherent limitations to our risk management strategies as there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that we have not appropriately anticipated or identified. If our risk management framework proves ineffective, we could suffer unexpected losses and our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur modest size makes it more difficult for us to compete.\nOur modest size makes it more difficult to compete with other financial institutions which are generally larger and can more easily afford to invest in the marketing and technologies needed to attract and retain customers. Because our principal source of income is the net interest income we earn on our loans and investments after deducting interest paid on deposits and other sources of funds, our ability to generate the revenues needed to cover our expenses and finance such investments is limited by the size of our loan and investment portfolios. Accordingly, we are not always able to offer new products and services as quickly as our competitors. As a smaller institution, we are also disproportionately affected by the continually increasing costs of compliance with new banking and other regulations.\nWe face risks related to our operational, technological and organizational infrastructure.\nOur ability to grow and compete, including to develop and deliver new products that meet the needs of our existing customers and attract new ones, is dependent on our ability to build or acquire the necessary operational and technological infrastructure and to manage the cost of that infrastructure as we expand. Our ability to run our business in compliance with applicable laws and regulations is also dependent on that infrastructure. Similar to other corporations, operational risk can manifest itself in many ways, such as errors related to failed or inadequate processes, faulty or disabled computer systems, fraud by employees or outside persons and exposure to external events. As discussed below, we are dependent on our operational infrastructure to help manage these risks. In addition, we are heavily dependent on the strength and capability of our technology systems, which we use both to interface with our customers and to manage our internal financial records and other systems. Any shortcomings in our technology systems, including, by way of example, an inability to prevent manual journal entries, subjects us to risk of misconduct by our employees that may go undetected.\nWe monitor our operational and technological capabilities and make modifications and improvements when we believe it will be cost effective to do so. In some instances, we may build and maintain these capabilities ourselves. Specifically, we provide our own core systems processing and essential web hosting. We also outsource some of these functions to third parties. If we experience difficulties, fail to comply with banking regulations or keep up with increasingly sophisticated technologies, our operations could be interrupted. If an interruption were to continue for a significant period of time, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, perhaps materially. Even if we are able to replace them, it may be at a higher cost to us, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdherence to our internal policies and procedures by our employees is critical to our performance and how we are perceived by our regulators.\nOur internal policies and procedures are a critical component of our corporate governance and, in some cases, compliance with applicable regulations. We adopt internal policies and procedures to guide management and employees regarding the operation and conduct of our business. Any deviation or non-adherence to these internal policies and procedures, such as the conduct leading to the permanent discontinuation of the Advantage Loan Program, whether intentional or unintentional, could have a detrimental effect on our management, operations or financial condition.\nWe must keep pace with technological change to remain competitive and introduce new products and services.\nFinancial products and services have become increasingly technologically driven. Our ability to meet the needs of our customers competitively and introduce new products in a cost-efficient manner is dependent on the ability to keep pace with technological advances, to invest in new technology as it becomes available, and to obtain and maintain related essential personnel. Many of our competitors have already implemented critical technologies and have greater resources to invest in technology than we do and may be better equipped to market new technologically driven products and services. In addition, we may not have the same ability to rapidly respond to technological innovations as our competitors do. Furthermore, the introduction of new technologies and products by financial technology companies and \"fintech\" platforms may adversely affect our ability to obtain new customers and successfully grow our business. The ability to keep pace with technological change is important, and the failure to do so, due to cost, proficiency or otherwise, could have a material adverse impact on our business and therefore on our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in accounting standards could materially impact our financial statements.\nFrom time to time, the FASB or the SEC may change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Such changes may result in us being subject to new or changing accounting and reporting standards. In addition, the bodies that interpret the accounting standards (such as banking regulators, outside auditors or management) may change their interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. These changes may be beyond our control, can be hard to predict, and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retrospectively, or apply an existing standard differently, also retrospectively, in each case resulting in our needing to revise or restate prior period consolidated financial statements.\nAdverse conditions internationally could adversely affect our business.\nMany of our customers are recent immigrants or foreign nationals. U.S. and global economic policies, military tensions, and unfavorable global economic conditions may adversely impact the economies in which our customers have family or business ties. A significant deterioration of economic conditions internationally, and in Asia in particular, could expose us to, among other things, economic\nand transfer risk, and we could experience an outflow of deposits by those of our customers with connections to Asia. In addition, foreign currency restrictions, particularly on the movement of cash from abroad, could adversely affect many of our customers, including with respect to their ability to make down payments or repay loans. Adverse economic conditions abroad, and in China or Taiwan in particular, may also negatively impact asset values and the profitability and liquidity of our customers with ties to these regions.\nThe permanent discontinuation of the Advantage Loan Program may significantly reduce our ability to meet the needs of many of our customers.\nMany of our customers are recent immigrants or foreign nationals who often lack the traditional financial documentation required to qualify for conforming mortgages. The Advantage Loan Program was designed in part to meet the financing needs of this community. If we are unable to replace the Advantage Loan Program with a reliable and prudent loan program, we may lose the ability to service these customers, which would result in a material and adverse effect on our loan production and results of operations.\nChanges in the valuation of our securities portfolio could hurt our profits and reduce our shareholders' equity.\nOur securities portfolio may be impacted by fluctuations in market value, potentially reducing accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and/or net income. Fluctuations in market value may be caused by changes in market interest rates, lower market prices for securities and limited investor demand. Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis, with more frequent evaluation for selected issues. In analyzing a debt issuer's financial condition, management may consider whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies, whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred and industry analysts' reports. In analyzing an equity issuer's financial condition, management may consider industry analysts' reports, financial performance and projected target prices of investment analysts. If this evaluation shows impairment to the actual or projected cash flows associated with one or more securities, a potential loss to net income may occur. Changes in interest rates can also have an adverse effect on our financial condition, as our available-for-sale securities are reported at their estimated fair value, and therefore are impacted by fluctuations in interest rates. We increase or decrease our shareholders' equity by the amount of change in the estimated fair value of the available-for-sale securities, net of taxes. Declines in market value could result in other-than-temporary impairments of these assets, which would lead to accounting charges that could have a material adverse effect on our net income and capital levels. See \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Investment Securities Portfolio.\"\nAs part of our asset/liability management strategy, we sell portions of our residential loan portfolio from time to time, while retaining servicing rights. If the market for our mortgage loans to the secondary market were to significantly contract, or if purchasers were to lose confidence in the quality of our loans, our earnings profile would be negatively affected and our ability to manage our balance sheet would be materially and adversely affected.\nFrom time to time, we manage our liquidity and balance sheet risk by selling loans in our mortgage portfolio into the secondary market. If the market for our mortgages were to contract or our counterparties were to lose confidence in our asset quality, we would lose a key piece of our liquidity strategy and would need to find alternative means to manage our liquidity that may be less effective. In addition, in connection with residential mortgages packaged for sale in the secondary market, we make representations and warranties, which, if breached, may require us to repurchase such loans, substitute other loans or indemnify the purchasers of such loans for actual losses incurred in respect of such loans. The recent permanent discontinuation of our Advantage Loan Program may lead some\npurchasers to claim that the historical representations and warranties we have made in connection with such sales were inaccurate. A substantial decline in residential real estate values in the markets in which we originated such loans could increase the risk of such claims. While we currently believe our repurchase risk remains low based upon the minimal credit losses experienced in our historical loan portfolio, it is possible that requests to repurchase loans could occur in the future. If the market for our residential portfolio were to contract or if a significant number of purchasers claimed our historical representations and warranties made in connection with loans made under the Advantage Loan Program were inaccurate and requested that we repurchase such loans, our liquidity, capital ratios and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\nAny debt service obligations will reduce the funds available for other business purposes, and the terms and covenants relating to our current and future indebtedness could adversely impact our financial performance and liquidity.\nWe have sold $65.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 7.0% Fixed to Floating Subordinated Notes due April 15, 2026. As a result, we are currently, and to the extent we incur significant debt in the future, we will be, subject to risks typically associated with debt financing, such as insufficient cash flow to meet required debt service payment obligations and the inability to refinance existing indebtedness. In addition, our subordinated notes and the related subordinated note purchase agreements contain customary covenants, which under certain circumstances place restrictions on our ability to pay dividends or make other distributions and enter into certain transactions, including acquisition activity. If we fail to satisfy one or more of the covenants under our subordinated notes, we would be in default under such notes, and may be required to repay such debt with capital from other sources. Under such circumstances, other sources of capital may not be available to us on reasonable terms or at all.\nWe and our borrowers in our California communities may be adversely affected by earthquakes or other natural disasters and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster.\nThe majority of our branches are located in the San Francisco and Los Angeles, California areas, which in the past have experienced both severe earthquakes and wildfires. We do not carry earthquake insurance on our properties. Earthquakes, wildfires or other natural disasters could severely disrupt our operations, and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. In addition, our customers and loan collateral may be severely impacted by such events, resulting in losses.\nIf a natural disaster, power outage or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our branches, that damaged critical infrastructure or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible, for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time in the San Francisco and/or Los Angeles, California areas. The disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place currently are limited and are unlikely to prove adequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial expenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, which, particularly when taken together with our lack of earthquake insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Governance Matters\nWe have been a \"controlled company\" under the corporate governance rules for Nasdaq-listed companies, and we may elect to take full advantage of the \"controlled company\" exception, which would make our common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\nBecause we have qualified as a \"controlled company\" under the corporate governance rules for Nasdaq-listed companies since our initial public offering, we are not required to have a majority of our board of directors be independent, nor are we required to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating function. Although we have recently received informal notice that due to a recent change in trustee for a number of the Seligman family trusts, we may lose controlled company status, we are still eligible to take full advantage of the controlled company exceptions for one year following the loss of controlled company status. Currently, Sandra Seligman and Seth Meltzer, who are not independent directors, serve on our Nominating Committee. Although we do not intend to rely upon the \"controlled company\" exception to the board of directors and committee independence requirements under the rules of Nasdaq, except for our Nominating Committee, we could elect to do so in the future. In this regard, in light of our status as a controlled company, our board of directors could elect not to have a majority of our board of directors be independent or not to have a compensation committee. Accordingly, should the interests of our controlling shareholder differ from those of other shareholders, the other shareholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance rules for Nasdaq-listed companies. We may take advantage of some or all the \"controlled company\" exceptions and to the extent we do not, this determination could change in the future. Our status as a controlled company could make our common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\nThe Seligman family, directly through the family's trust, has influenced and has the ability to continue to influence Company operations and to control the outcome of matters submitted for shareholder approval and may have interests that differ from those of our other shareholders.\nScott J. Seligman and others of his family members were the original founders of the Bank, and Mr. Seligman has had a variety of senior roles and positions over the course of many years. Prior to 2000, he served as a member of the Bank's board and as chief executive officer of the Bank. After 2000 and through December 31, 2019, he served as a consulting director to the board of the Bank and retained the title of vice president of the Company. In these roles, Mr. Seligman participated in the conduct of the affairs of the Bank and had a significant influence over the Bank's operations. In addition, Mr. Seligman caused the Bank to engage in various transactions with other Seligman-controlled businesses. For example, the Bank has a sublease agreement with Seligman & Associates for office space, and the Bank provides monthly data processing and programming services to entities controlled by the Company's controlling shareholders. Mr. Seligman resigned from his positions as consulting director to the board of the Bank and as vice president of the Company effective December 31, 2019.\nCertain trusts for the benefit of members of the Seligman family and administered by their trustees or other Seligman family members or their designees beneficially own approximately 70% of our common stock. The trustees of the trusts for the benefit of Scott J. Seligman have voting and dispositive power over approximately 48% of our common stock, effectively giving such trusts control over the outcome of the shareholder votes on most matters. The trustee of the trusts for the benefit of Sandra Seligman has voting and dispositive power over approximately 18% of our common stock. Prior to August 2020, Mr. Seligman and Ms. Seligman utilized the same trustee for their respective trusts. Should the Seligman family and their trusts vote as a block, they would have effective control over the outcome of the votes on all matters requiring approval by shareholders, including the election of directors, the adoption of amendments to our articles of incorporation and bylaws and the approval of a sale of the Company and other significant corporate transactions, regardless of how other\nshareholders vote on these matters. Furthermore, the interests of the Seligman family may be different than the interests of other shareholders. This concentration of voting power could also have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control or other business combination that might otherwise be beneficial to our shareholders.\nCertain provisions of our corporate governance documents and Michigan law could discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition at a premium price.\nOur second amended and restated articles of incorporation contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our Company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors. These include provisions that, among other things:\n\u2022 permit the board to issue up to 10 million shares of preferred stock, with any rights, preferences and privileges as they may determine (including the right to approve an acquisition or other change in control);\n\u2022 provide that the authorized number of directors may be fixed only by the board in accordance with our amended and restated bylaws;\n\u2022 do not provide for cumulative voting rights (therefore allowing the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote in any election of directors to elect all of the directors standing for election);\n\u2022 divide our board into three staggered classes;\n\u2022 provide that all vacancies and newly created directorships may be filled by the affirmative vote of at least 80% of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum;\n\u2022 prohibit removal of directors without cause;\n\u2022 prohibit shareholders from calling special meetings of shareholders;\n\u2022 require unanimous consent for stockholders to take action by written consent without approval of the action by our board;\n\u2022 provide that shareholders seeking to present proposals before a meeting of shareholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at a meeting of shareholders must provide advance notice in writing and also comply with specified requirements related to the form and content of a shareholder's notice;\n\u2022 require at least 80% supermajority shareholder approval to alter, amend or repeal certain provisions of our second amended and restated articles of incorporation; and\n\u2022 require at least 80% supermajority shareholder approval in order for shareholders to adopt, amend or repeal our amended and restated bylaws.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for shareholders to replace members of the board of directors, which is responsible for appointing members of our management. Any matters requiring the approval of our shareholders will require the approval of the Seligman family and their trustees, which may have interests that differ from those of our other shareholders.\nIn addition, the 2017 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan provides that restricted stock awards become fully vested in the event of a change in control and permits the board of directors or a committee thereof to accelerate, vest or cause the restrictions to lapse with respect to other outstanding awards including stock options, in the event of, or immediately prior to, a change in control. Such vesting or acceleration could discourage the acquisition of our Company.\nWe could also become subject to certain anti-takeover provisions under Michigan law which may discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring us or merging with us, whether or not an acquisition or merger is desired by or beneficial to our shareholders. If a corporation's board of directors chooses to \"opt-in\" to certain provisions of Michigan Law, such corporation may not, in general, engage in a business combination with any beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 10% of the corporation's outstanding voting shares unless the holder has held the shares for five years or more or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the business combination. Our board of directors has not elected to be subject to this provision, but could do so in the future. Any provision of our second amended and restated articles of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws or Michigan law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our shareholders to receive a premium for their shares, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock otherwise.\nOur second amended and restated articles of incorporation designates the courts of the State of Michigan located in Oakland County and the United States District for the Eastern District of Michigan as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders, which could limit our shareholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.\nOur second amended and restated articles of incorporation provides that the courts of the State of Michigan located in Oakland County and the United States District for the Eastern District of Michigan shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, or employees to us or our shareholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Michigan Business Corporation Act (as it may be amended from time to time, the \"MBCA\"), or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us governed by the State of Michigan's internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our common stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of our second amended and restated articles of incorporation described above. This choice of forum provision may limit a shareholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our second amended and restated articles of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur ability to pay dividends is restricted by applicable law and the terms of our subordinated notes.\nOur ability to pay cash dividends is restricted by the terms of our subordinated notes as well as applicable provisions of Michigan law and the rules and regulations of the OCC and the FRB. Any future determination to pay dividends to holders of our common stock will depend on our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements, banking regulations, contractual restrictions and any other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant, and we can provide no assurance that we will pay any dividends to our shareholders in the future.", "PERMNO": 17121, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "SBT"}
