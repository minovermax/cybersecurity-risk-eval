Most are general risks and uncertainties applicable to all water and wastewater utility companies. We describe below some of the specific known risk factors that could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. If one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results may vary materially from our projections.\nOur operating revenue is primarily from water sales. The rates that we charge our customers are subject to the regulations of the public service commissions in the states in which we operate. If a public service commission disapproves or is unable to timely approve our requests for rate increases or approves rate increases that are inadequate to cover our investments or increased costs, our profitability may suffer.\nWe file rate increase requests, from time to time, to recover our investments in utility plant and expenses. Once a rate increase petition is filed with a public service commission, the ensuing administrative and hearing process may be lengthy and costly. We can provide no assurances that any future rate increase request will be approved by the DEPSC, MDPSC or PAPUC, and if approved, we cannot guarantee that these rate increases will be granted in a timely manner and/or will be sufficient in amount to cover the investments and expenses for which we initially sought the rate increase. To the extent we are able to pass through such costs to customers and a state public service commission subsequently determines that such costs should not have been paid by customers, we may be required to refund such costs, with interest, to customers. Any such costs not recovered through rates, or any such refund, could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nWe rely on governmental approvals in the States of Delaware, Maryland and Pennsylvania, as well as from the Delaware River Basin Commission and Susquehanna River Basin Commission for applicable water allocation, water appropriation and water capacity permits. In addition, we rely on governmental approvals in the State of Delaware for applicable wastewater collection, treatment and disposal permits that will assist in the operation of our wastewater business.\nOur water and wastewater services are governed by various federal and state governmental agencies. Pursuant to these regulations, we are required to obtain various permits for any additional systems to assist in our operations. If any of those permit approvals are not received timely or at all, we may risk the loss of economic opportunity and our ability to create additional systems for the effective operation of our water business in the States of Delaware, Maryland and Pennsylvania or our wastewater business in the State of Delaware. We can provide no assurances that we will receive all necessary permits to create additional systems to assist in the operation of our water or wastewater business.\nOur operating costs could be significantly increased if new or stricter regulatory standards are imposed by federal and state environmental agencies.\nOur water and wastewater services are governed by various federal and state environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations, including the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, the Clean Water Act and similar state laws. These federal and state regulations are issued by the EPA and state environmental regulatory agencies. Pursuant to these laws, we are required to obtain various water allocation permits and environmental permits for our operations. The water allocation permits control the amount of water that can be drawn from water resources. New or stricter water allocation regulations can adversely affect our ability to meet the demands of our customers. While we have budgeted for future capital and operating expenditures to maintain compliance with these laws and our permits, it is possible that new or stricter standards would be imposed that will raise our operating costs. Thus, we can provide no assurances that our costs of complying with, or discharging liability under current and future environmental and health and safety laws will not adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur business is subject to seasonal fluctuations, which could affect demand for our water service and our revenues.\nDemand for water during warmer months is generally greater than during cooler months primarily due to additional customer requirements in irrigation systems, swimming pools, cooling systems and other outside water use. In the event that temperatures during typically warmer months are cooler than normal, or rainfall is more than normal, the demand for our water may decrease and adversely affect our revenues.\nDrought conditions and government imposed water use restrictions may impact our ability to serve our current and future customers, and may impact our customers\u2019 use of our water, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe believe that we have in place sufficient capacity to provide water service for the foreseeable future to all existing and new customers in all of our service territories. However, severe drought conditions could interfere with our sources of water supply and could adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our existing and future customers. This may adversely affect our revenues and earnings. Moreover, governmental restrictions on water usage during drought conditions may result in a decreased demand for water, which may adversely affect our revenue and earnings.\nWe are subject to risks associated with the collection, treatment and disposal of wastewater.\nWastewater collection, treatment and disposal involve various unique risks. If collection or treatment systems fail, overflow, or do not operate properly, untreated wastewater or other contaminants could spill onto nearby properties or into nearby streams and rivers, causing damage to persons or property, injury to aquatic life and economic damages, which may not be recoverable in fees. This risk is most acute during periods of substantial rainfall or flooding, which are common causes of sewer overflow and system failure. Liabilities resulting from such damages and injuries could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nTurnover in our management team could have an adverse impact on our business or the financial market\u2019s perception of our ability to continue to grow.\nOur success depends significantly on the continued contribution of our management team both individually and collectively. The loss of the services of any member of our management team or the inability to hire and retain experienced management personnel could harm our operating results. In addition, turnover in our management team could adversely affect the financial market\u2019s perception of our ability to continue to grow.\nWe face competition from other water and wastewater utilities for the acquisition of new exclusive service territories.\nWe face competition from other water and wastewater utilities as we pursue the right to exclusively serve territories in Delaware and Maryland by entering into agreements with landowners, developers or municipalities and, under current law, then applying to the DEPSC or the MDPSC for a CPCN. If we are unable to enter into agreements with landowners, developers or municipalities and secure CPCNs for the right to exclusively serve territories in Delaware or Maryland, our ability to expand may be significantly impeded.\nWe depend on the availability of capital for expansion, construction and maintenance. Weaknesses in capital and credit markets may limit our access to capital.\nOur ability to continue our expansion efforts and fund our utility construction and maintenance program depends on the availability of adequate capital. There is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain sufficient capital in the future on favorable terms and conditions for expansion, construction and maintenance. In the event our lines of credit are not extended or we are unable to refinance our first mortgage bonds when due and the borrowings are called for payment, we will have to seek alternative financing sources, although there can be no assurance that these alternative financing sources will be available on terms acceptable to us. In the event we are unable to obtain sufficient capital, our expansion efforts could be curtailed, which may affect our growth and may affect our future results of operations.\nGeneral economic conditions may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe effects of adverse U.S. economic conditions may lead to a number of impacts on our business that may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Such impacts may include a reduction in discretionary and recreational water use by our residential water customers, particularly during the summer months; a decline in usage by industrial and commercial customers as a result of decreased business activity and commerce in our customers\u2019 businesses; an increased incidence of customers\u2019 inability, bankruptcy or delay in paying their bills which may lead to higher bad debt expense and reduced cash flow; and a lower natural customer growth rate may result as compared to what had been experienced before the economic downturn due to a decline in new housing starts and a possible slight decline in the number of active customers due to housing vacancies or abandonments.\nAny future acquisitions we undertake or other actions to further grow our water and wastewater business may involve risks.\nAn element of our growth strategy is the acquisition and integration of water and wastewater systems in order to broaden our current service areas, and move into new ones. It is our intent, when practical, to integrate any businesses we acquire with our existing operations. The negotiation of potential acquisitions as well as the integration of acquired businesses could require us to incur significant costs and cause diversion of our management\u2019s time and resources. We may not be successful in the future in identifying businesses that meet our acquisition criteria. The failure to identify such businesses may limit the rate of our growth. In addition, future acquisitions or expansion of our service areas by us could result in:\n-\nDilutive issuance of our equity securities;\n-\nIncurrence of debt and contingent liabilities;\n-\nDifficulties in integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses;\n-\nDiversion of our management\u2019s attention from ongoing business concerns;\n-\nFailure to have effective internal control over financial reporting;\n-\nOverload of human resources; and\n-\nOther acquisition-related expense.\nSome or all of these items could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to finance our business and comply with regulatory requirements. The businesses we acquire in the future may not achieve sales and profitability that would justify our investment.\nWe also may experience risks relating to the challenges and costs of closing a transaction and the risk that an announced transaction may not close. Completion of certain acquisition transactions are conditioned upon, among other things, the receipt of approvals, including from certain state public utilities commissions. Failure to complete a pending transaction would prevent us from realizing the anticipated benefits. We would also remain liable for significant transaction costs, including legal and accounting fees, whether or not the transaction is completed.\nWe are subject to, and could be further subject to, governmental investigations or actions by other third parties.\nWe are subject to various federal and state laws, including environmental laws, violations of which can involve civil or criminal sanctions.\nOur operations from time to time could be parties to or targets of lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including system failure, injury, contract, environmental, health and safety and employment matters, which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. The results of any future litigation or settlement of such lawsuits and claims are inherently unpredictable, but such outcomes could also materially and adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.\nContamination of our water supply may result in disruption in our services and could lead to litigation that may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur water supplies are subject to contamination from naturally-occurring compounds as well as pollution resulting from man-made sources. Even though we monitor the quality of our water on an on-going basis, any possible contamination due to factors beyond our control could interrupt the use of our water supply until we are able to substitute it from an uncontaminated water source. Additionally, treating the contaminated water source could involve significant costs and could adversely affect our business. We could also be held liable for consequences arising out of human or environmental exposure to hazardous substances, if found, in our water supply. This could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAging infrastructure may lead to service disruptions, property damage and increased capital expenditures and operation and management costs, all of which could negatively impact our financial results.\nWe have risks associated with aging infrastructure, including water and sewer mains, pumping stations and water and wastewater treatment facilities. Additionally, the nature of information available on buried and newly acquired assets may be limited, which may challenge our ability to conduct efficient asset management and maintenance practices. Assets that have aged beyond their expected useful lives may experience a higher rate of failure. Failure of aging infrastructure could result in increased capital expenditures and operation and management costs. In addition, failure of aging infrastructure may result in property damage, and in safety, environmental and public health impacts. To the extent that any increased costs or expenditures are not fully recovered in rates, our results of operations, liquidity and cash flows could be negatively impacted.\nWe are dependent on the continuous and reliable operation of our information technology systems.\nWe rely on our information technology systems to manage our operation of our business. Specifically, our business relies on the following technology systems: customer information system, financial reporting system, asset tracking system, remote monitoring system for some of our treatment, storage and pumping facilities, human resources management system, inventory management system, and accounts receivable collection management system. Such systems require periodic modifications, upgrades or replacement that subject us to inherent costs and risks, including substantial capital expenditures, additional administration and operating expenses, and other risks and costs of delays in transitioning to new systems or of integrating new systems into our current systems. Our computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by natural disasters, telecommunications failures or acts of war or terrorism or similar events or disruptions. A loss of these systems or major problems with the operation of these systems could affect our operations and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThere have been an increasing number of cyber-attacks on companies around the world, which have caused operational failures or compromised sensitive corporate or customer data. These attacks have occurred over the internet, through malware, viruses or attachments to e-mails, or through persons inside the organization or with access to systems inside the organization. We have implemented security measures and will continue to devote resources to address any security vulnerabilities in an effort to prevent cyber-attacks. Despite our efforts, a cyber-attack, if it occurred, could cause water or wastewater system problems, disrupt service to our customers, compromise important data or systems or result in an unintended release of customer information. We feel we have adequate cyber-security insurance coverage to mitigate the cost of any such cyber-attack; however, a possible cyber-attack could affect our operations and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nPotential terrorist attacks may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe have security measures in place at our facilities, including for delivery and handling of certain chemicals, as well as programs in place to ensure employee awareness of potential threats. We have and will continue to bear any increase in costs, most of which have been recoverable under state regulatory policies, for security precautions to protect our facilities, operations and supplies. While the costs of increases in security, including capital expenditures, may be significant, we expect these costs to continue to be recoverable in water and wastewater rates. Despite our security measures, we may not be in a position to control the outcome of terrorist events, or other attacks on our water systems, should they occur.\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends in the future or, if dividends are paid, that they will be in amounts similar to past dividends.\nDividends on our common stock will only be paid if and when declared by our Board of Directors. Our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, applicable regulations and other factors, including the timeliness and adequacy of rate increases, will determine both our ability to pay dividends on common stock and the amount of the dividends declared by our Board of Directors. There can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends in the future or, if dividends are paid, that they will be in amounts similar to past dividends.\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile and may be affected by market conditions beyond our control.\nThe trading price of our common stock may fluctuate in the future based on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control and unrelated to our financial results. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock include but are not limited to volatility of the general stock market or the utility stock index, regulatory developments, general economic conditions and trends, actual or anticipated changes or fluctuations in our results of operations, actual or anticipated changes in the expectations of investors or securities analysts, actual or anticipated developments in our competitors\u2019 businesses or the competitive landscape generally, litigation involving us or our industry, major catastrophic events or sales of large blocks of our stock. Furthermore, we believe that stockholders invest in public utility stocks in part because they seek reliable dividend payments. If there is an over supply of stock of public utilities in the market relative to demand by such investors, the trading price of our common stock may decrease. Additionally, if interest rates rise above the dividend yield offered by our common stock, demand for our stock and its trading price may also decrease.", "PERMNO": 83469, "SIC": 4941, "TIC": "ARTNA"}
