{"cik": "719220", "company": "S&T BANCORP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvestments in our common stock involve risk. The following discussion highlights the risks that we believe are material to S&T, but does not necessarily include all risks that we may face.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results have varied significantly in the past and could vary significantly in the future, which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results. Our operating results may fluctuate due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including the changing U.S. economic environment and changes in the commercial and residential real estate market, any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate. If our operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Our stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors including, among other things:\n\u2022\nvolatility of stock market prices and volumes in general;\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022\nchanges in conditions in credit markets;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting policies or procedures as required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, or other regulatory agencies;\n\u2022\nlegislative and regulatory actions (including the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act and related regulations) subjecting us to additional regulatory oversight which may result in increased compliance costs and/or require us to change our business model;\n\u2022\ngovernment intervention in the U.S. financial system and the effects of and changes in trade and monetary and fiscal policies and laws, including the interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve Board;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key members of management;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results; and\n\u2022\nchanges in analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial performance.\nRisks Related to Credit\nOur ability to assess the credit-worthiness of our customers may diminish, which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe take credit risk by virtue of making loans and extending loan commitments and letters of credit. Our exposure to credit risk is managed through the use of consistent underwriting standards that emphasize \u201cin-market\u201d lending while avoiding highly leveraged transactions as well as excessive industry and other concentrations. Our credit administration function employs risk management techniques to ensure that loans adhere to corporate policy and problem loans are promptly identified. There can be no assurance that such measures will be effective in avoiding undue credit risk. If the models and approaches we use to select, manage and underwrite our consumer and commercial loan products become less predictive of future charge-offs (due, for example, to rapid changes in the economy, including the unemployment rate), our credit losses may increase.\nThe value of the collateral used to secure our loans may not be sufficient to compensate for the amount of an unpaid loan and we may be unsuccessful in recovering the remaining balance from our customers.\nDecreases in real estate values, particularly with respect to our commercial lending and mortgage activities, could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral for our loans and our customers\u2019 ability to repay these loans, which in turn could impact our profitability. Repayment of our commercial loans is often dependent on the cash flow of the borrower, which may become unpredictable. If the value of the assets, such as real estate, serving as collateral for the loan portfolio were to decline materially, a significant part of the loan portfolio could become under-collateralized. If the loans that are secured by real estate become troubled when real estate market conditions are declining or have declined, in the event of foreclosure, we may not be able to realize the amount of collateral that was anticipated at the time of originating the loan. This could result in higher charge-offs which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nChanges in the overall credit quality of our portfolio can have a significant impact on our earnings.\nLike other lenders, we face the risk that our customers will not repay their loans. We reserve for losses in our loan portfolio based on our assessment of inherent credit losses. This process, which is critical to our financial results and condition, requires complex judgment including our assessment of economic conditions, which are difficult to predict. Through a periodic review of the loan portfolio, management determines the amount of the allowance for loan loss, or ALL, by considering historical losses combined with qualitative factors including general and regional economic conditions, asset quality trends, loan policy and underwriting and changes in loan concentrations and collateral values. The amount of future losses is susceptible to changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in interest rates, which may be beyond our control. We may underestimate our inherent losses and fail to hold an ALL sufficient to account for these losses. Incorrect assumptions\ncould lead to material underestimates of inherent losses and an inadequate ALL. As our assessment of inherent losses changes, we may need to increase or decrease our ALL, which could impact our financial results and profitability.\nOur loan portfolio is concentrated in western Pennsylvania, and our lack of geographic diversification increases our risk profile.\nThe regional economic conditions in western Pennsylvania affect the demand for our products and services as well as the ability of our customers to repay their loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans. We are less able than a larger institution to spread the risks of unfavorable local economic conditions across a large number of diversified economies. A significant decline in the regional economy caused by inflation, recession, unemployment or other factors could negatively affect our customers, the quality of our loan portfolio and the demand for our products and services. Any sustained period of increased payment delinquencies, foreclosures or losses caused by adverse market or economic conditions in our market area could adversely affect the value of our assets, revenues, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, we cannot give any assurance that we will benefit from any market growth or favorable economic conditions in our primary market area.\nOur loan portfolio has a significant concentration of commercial real estate loans.\nThe majority of our loans are to commercial borrowers. The commercial real estate, or CRE, segment of our loan portfolio is typically more impacted by economic fluctuations. CRE lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts, and the repayment of these loans is generally dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the properties securing the loans to cover operating expenses and debt service. Because payments on loans secured by CRE often depend upon the successful operation and management of the properties, repayment of these loans may be affected by factors outside the borrower\u2019s control, including adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. Additionally, we have a number of significant credit exposures to commercial borrowers, and while the majority of these borrowers have numerous projects that make up the total aggregate exposure, if one or more of these borrowers default or have financial difficulties, we could experience higher credit losses, which could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nAn interruption or security breach of our information systems may result in financial losses or in a loss of customers.\nWe depend upon data processing, communication and information exchange on a variety of computing platforms and networks, including the internet. We have experienced cyber security incidents in the past, which we did not deem material, and may experience them in the future. We believe that we have implemented appropriate measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology and our operations from these information technology disruptions. However, we cannot be certain that all of our systems are entirely free from vulnerability to attack, despite safeguards we have instituted. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions or security breaches of our information systems could disrupt our continuity of operations or result in the disclosure of sensitive, personal customer information which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations through damage to our reputation, loss of customer business, remedial costs, additional regulatory scrutiny or exposure to civil litigation and possible financial liability. Losses arising from such a breach could materially exceed the amount of insurance coverage we have, which could adversely affect our results of operation.\nWe rely on third-party providers and other suppliers for a number of services that are important to our business. An interruption or cessation of an important service by any third party could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are dependent for the majority of our technology, including our core operating system, on third party providers. If these companies were to discontinue providing services to us, we may experience significant disruption to our business. If any of our third party service providers experience financial, operational or technological difficulties, or if there is any other disruption in our relationships with them, we may be required to locate alternative sources of such services. We are dependent on these third-party retailers securing their information systems, over which we have no control, and a breach of their information systems could result in the disclosure of sensitive, personal customer information, which could have a material adverse impact on our business through damage to our reputation, loss of customer business, remedial costs, additional regulatory scrutiny or exposure to civil litigation and possible financial liability. Assurance cannot be provided that we could negotiate terms with alternative service sources that are as favorable or could obtain services with similar functionality as found in existing systems without the need to expend substantial resources, if at all, thereby resulting in a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Interest Rates and Investments\nOur net interest income could be negatively affected by interest rate changes which may adversely affect our financial condition.\nOur results of operations are largely dependent on net interest income, which is the difference between the interest and fees earned on interest-earning assets and the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. There may be mismatches between the maturity and repricing of our assets and liabilities that could cause the net interest rate spread to compress, depending on the level and type of changes in the interest rate environment. Interest rates could remain at historical low levels causing rate spread compression over an extended period of time. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental agencies. In addition, some of our customers often have the ability to prepay loans or redeem deposits with either no penalties, or penalties that are insufficient to compensate us for the lost income. A significant reduction in our net interest income will adversely affect our business and results of operations. If we are unable to manage interest rate risk effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed.\nDeclines in the value of investment securities held by us could require write-downs, which would reduce our earnings.\nIn order to diversify earnings and enhance liquidity, we own both debt and equity instruments of government agencies, municipalities and other companies. We may be required to record impairment charges on our investment securities if they suffer a decline in value that is considered other-than-temporary. Additionally, the value of these investments may fluctuate depending on the interest rate environment, general economic conditions and circumstances specific to the issuer. Volatile market conditions may detrimentally affect the value of these securities, such as through reduced valuations due to the perception of heightened credit or liquidity risks. Changes in the value of these instruments may result in a reduction to earnings and/or capital, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Business Strategy\nOur strategy includes growth plans through organic growth and by means of acquisitions, which includes growth within our current footprint and growth through market expansion. Our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively.\nWe intend to continue pursuing a growth strategy through, organic growth and by means of acquisitions, both within our current footprint and market expansion. In addition to our acquisition of Integrity Bancshares, Inc., which we expect to complete in the first quarter of 2015, we continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities as another source of growth. We cannot give assurance that we will be able to expand our existing market presence, or successfully enter new markets or that any such expansion will not adversely affect our results of operations. Failure to manage our growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, future prospects, financial condition or results of operations and could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our business strategy.\nOur failure to find suitable acquisition candidates, or successfully bid against other competitors for acquisitions, could adversely affect our ability to fully implement our business strategy. If we are successful in acquiring other entities, the process of integrating such entities, including Integrity Bancshares, Inc., will divert significant management time and resources. We may not be able to integrate efficiently or operate profitably Integrity Bancshares, Inc. or any other entity we may acquire. We may experience disruption and incur unexpected expenses in integrating acquisitions. These failures could adversely impact our future prospects and results of operation.\nWe are subject to competition from both banks and non-banking companies.\nThe financial services industry is highly competitive, and we encounter strong competition for deposits, loans and other financial services in our market area. Our principal competitors include commercial banks of all types, finance companies, credit unions, mortgage brokers, insurance agencies, trust companies and various sellers of investments and investment advice. Many of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same degree of regulation that we are and have advantages over us in providing certain services. Additionally, many of our competitors are significantly larger than we are and have greater access to capital and other resources. Failure to compete effectively for deposit, loan and other financial services customers in our markets could cause us to lose market share, slow our growth rate and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be required to raise capital in the future, but that capital may not be available or may not be on acceptable terms when it is needed.\nWe are required by federal regulatory authorities to maintain adequate capital levels to support operations. New regulations to implement Basel III and the Dodd-Frank Act require us to have more capital. While we believe we currently have sufficient capital, if we cannot raise additional capital when needed, we may not be able to meet these requirements. Also our ability to further expand our operations through organic growth, which includes growth within our current footprint and growth through market expansion may be adversely affected. Our ability to raise additional capital is dependent on capital market conditions at that time and on our financial performance and outlook.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Compliance and Legal Matters\nLegislation enacted in response to market and economic conditions may significantly affect our operations, financial condition and earnings.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act was enacted as a major reform in response to the financial crisis that began in the last decade. The Dodd-Frank Act increases regulation and oversight of the financial services industry, and imposes restrictions on the ability of institutions within the industry to conduct business consistent with historical practices, including aspects such as capital requirements, affiliate transactions, compensation, consumer protection regulations and mortgage regulation, among others. It is not clear what impact the Dodd-Frank Act and the numerous implementing regulations will ultimately have on the financial markets or on the U.S. banking and financial services industries and the broader U.S. and global economies. They may increase our costs of regulatory compliance and of doing business and otherwise affect our operations, and will likely result in additional costs and a diversion of management\u2019s time from other business activities, any of which may adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity or financial condition.They also may significantly affect our business strategy, the markets in which we do business, the markets for and value of our investments and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability.\nOur deposit insurance premiums may increase in the future, which could have a material adverse impact on our future earnings and financial condition.\nThe FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured depository institutions, including S&T Bank. The FDIC charges insured depository institutions premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund, or DIF, at a specific level. The Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum target DIF ratio from 1.15 percent of estimated insured deposits to 1.35 percent of estimated insured deposits. The FDIC must seek to achieve the 1.35 percent ratio by September 30, 2020. Insured institutions with assets of $10 billion or more are supposed to fund the increase.\nThe FDIC has issued regulations to implement these provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. It has, in addition, established a higher reserve ratio of 2 percent as a long-term goal beyond what is required by statute. There is no implementation deadline for the 2 percent ratio. The FDIC may increase the assessment rates or impose additional special assessments in the future to keep the DIF at or above the statutory minimum target. Any increase in our FDIC premiums could have an adverse effect on the Bank\u2019s profits and financial condition. Refer to Supervision and Regulation within Part I, Item 1 of this Report for additional information.\nFuture governmental regulation and legislation could limit our growth.\nWe are subject to extensive state and federal regulation, supervision and legislation that govern nearly every aspect of our operations. The regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors, customers and the banking system as a whole, not shareholders. Failure to comply with applicable regulations could lead to penalties and damage to our reputation. Furthermore, as shown through the Dodd-Frank Act, the regulatory environment is constantly undergoing change and the impact of changes to laws, the rapid implementation of regulations, the interpretation of such laws or regulations or other actions by existing or new regulatory agencies could make regulatory compliance more difficult or expensive, and thus could affect our ability to deliver or expand services, or it could diminish the value of our business. The ramifications and uncertainties of the recent increase in government intervention in the U.S. financial system could also adversely affect us. Refer to Supervision and Regulation within Part I, Item 1 of this Report for additional information.\nNegative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely impact our earnings and liquidity.\nReputational risk, or the risk to our business, earnings, liquidity and capital from negative public opinion, could result from our actual or alleged conduct in a variety of areas, including legal and regulatory compliance, lending practices, corporate governance, litigation, ethical issues or inadequate protection of customer information. We are dependent on third-party providers for a number of services that are important to our business. Refer to the risk factor titled, \u201cWe rely on third-party providers and other suppliers for a number of services that are important to our business. An interruption or cessation of an important service by any third party could have a material adverse effect on our business\u201d for additional information. A failure by any of these third-party service providers could cause a disruption in our operations, which could result in negative public opinion about us or damage to our reputation. We expend significant resources to comply with regulatory requirements, and the\nfailure to comply with such regulations could result in reputational harm or significant legal or remedial costs. Damage to our reputation could adversely affect our ability to retain and attract new customers and adversely impact our earnings and liquidity.\nWe may be a defendant from time to time in a variety of litigation and other actions, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, customers and others make claims and take legal action pertaining to the performance of our responsibilities. Whether customer claims and legal action related to the performance of our responsibilities are founded or unfounded, if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to us, they may result in significant expenses, attention from management and financial liability. Any financial liability or reputational damage could have a material adverse effect on our business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Liquidity\nWe rely on a stable core deposit base as our primary source of liquidity.\nWe are dependent for our funding on a stable base of core deposits. Our ability to maintain a stable core deposit base is a function of our financial performance, our reputation and the security provided by FDIC insurance, which combined, gives customers confidence in us. If any of these items are damaged or come into question, the stability of our core deposits could be harmed.\nOur ability to meet contingency funding needs, in the event of a crisis that causes a disruption to our core deposit base, is dependent on access to wholesale markets, including funds provided by the FHLB of Pittsburgh.\nWe own stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank, or FHLB, in order to qualify for membership in the FHLB system, which enables us to borrow on our line of credit with the FHLB that is secured by a blanket lien on a significant portion of our loan portfolio. Changes or disruptions to the FHLB or the FHLB system in general may materially impact our ability to meet short and long-term liquidity needs or meet growth plans. Additionally, we cannot be assured that the FHLB will be able to provide funding to us when needed, nor can we be certain that the FHLB will provide funds specifically to us, should our financial condition and/or our regulators prevent access to our line of credit. The inability to access this source of funds could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to meet our customer\u2019s needs. Our financial flexibility could be severely constrained if we were unable to maintain our access to funding or if adequate financing is not available at acceptable interest rates.\nRisks Related to Owning Our Stock\nOur outstanding warrant may be dilutive to holders of our common stock.\nThe ownership interest of the existing holders of our common stock may be diluted to the extent our outstanding warrant is exercised. The warrant will remain outstanding until 2019. The shares of common stock underlying the warrant represent approximately 1.71 percent of the shares of our common stock outstanding as of January 31, 2015 (including the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrant in total shares outstanding). The warrant holder has the right to vote any of the shares of common stock it receives upon exercise of the warrant.\nOur ability to pay dividends on our common stock may be limited.\nHolders of our common stock will be entitled to receive only such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so and our Board of Directors could reduce, suspend or eliminate our dividend at any time. Any decrease or elimination to the dividends on our common stock could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 77528, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "STBA"}
