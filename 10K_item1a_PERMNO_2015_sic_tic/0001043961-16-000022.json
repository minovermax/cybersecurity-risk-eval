Our operating loss for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $9.2 million and $10.6 million, respectively. These historical losses have been due principally to the expenses that we have incurred in order to develop and market our products, the fixed nature of our manufacturing costs and merger and acquisition costs.\nRecurring operating losses raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe have incurred substantial operating losses and have used cash in our operating activities for the past several years. As of December 31, 2015, we had negative working capital of approximately $13.7 million. During the first quarter of 2016, we received net proceeds of approximately $2.0 million from the issuance of preferred stock and warrants to purchase shares of common stock.\nOur current operating plan projects improved operating results, improvement in collection rates and monetization of underutilized assets. There are no guarantees that these efforts will be successful and, if not, we may use more cash than projected and not be able to meet our current obligations through December 31, 2016. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nAs with any operating plan, there are risks associated with our ability to execute it. Therefore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to satisfy our obligations, or achieve the operating improvements as contemplated by the current operating plan. If we are unable to execute this plan, we will need to find additional sources of cash not contemplated by the current operating plan and/or raise additional capital to sustain continuing operations as currently contemplated. We could seek to raise additional funds through various potential sources such as through the sale of assets or sale of debt or equity securities. However, there can be no assurance that the additional funding sources will be available to us at reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to achieve our operating plan or obtain additional financing, our business would be jeopardized and we may not be able to continue as a going concern.\nOur future capital needs are uncertain and we may need to raise additional funds in the future.\nOur future capital needs are uncertain and we may need to raise additional funds in the future through debt or equity offerings. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nRevenue generated by sales of our products;\n\u2022\nExpenses incurred in manufacturing and selling our products;\n\u2022\nCosts of developing new products or technologies;\n\u2022\nCosts associated with capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nThe number and timing of strategic transactions; and\n\u2022\nWorking capital requirements related to growing existing business.\nWe may need additional capital to finance our growth or to compete, which may cause dilution to existing stockholders or limit our flexibility in conducting our business activities.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future to fund expansion, respond to competitive pressures or acquire complementary businesses, technologies or services. Such additional financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. To the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution, and to the extent we engage in additional debt financing, if available, we may become subject to additional restrictive covenants that could limit our flexibility in conducting future business activities. If additional financing is not available or not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to continue as a going concern, fund our expansion, promote our brands, take advantage of acquisition opportunities, develop or enhance services or respond to competitive pressures.\nGovernmental payers and health care plans have taken steps to control costs.\nMedicare, Medicaid and private insurers have increased their efforts to control the costs of health care services, including clinical testing services. They may reduce fee schedules or limit/exclude coverage for certain types of tests that we perform. Medicaid reimbursement varies by state and is subject to administrative and billing requirements and budget pressures. We expect efforts to reduce reimbursements, impose more stringent cost controls and reduce utilization of testing services will continue. These efforts, including changes in laws or regulations, may have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWeakness in U.S. or global economic conditions could have an adverse effect on our businesses.\nThe economies of the United States and other regions of the world in which we do business have experienced significant weakness, which, in the case of the U.S., has recently resulted in significant unemployment and slower growth in economic activity. A decline in economic conditions may adversely affect demand for our services and products, thus reducing our revenue. These conditions could also impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us. The strengthening dollar has the potential to adversely impact U.S. businesses that operate overseas.\nSales have been variable.\nOur laboratory performs project-based work that changes from quarter to quarter. Therefore, comparison of the results of successive quarters may not accurately reflect trends or results for the full year due to the fact that ICP is a new product and will enable the liquid biopsy market to evolve rapidly and ensure Precision Medicine is adopted globally. We see the ICP business and revenues growing as our commercial strategy is successful and our partnerships and licensing agreements become profitable.\nChanges in payer mix could have a material adverse impact on our net sales and profitability.\nTesting services are billed to physicians, patients, government payers such as Medicare, and insurance companies. Tests may be billed to different payers depending on a particular patient\u2019s medical insurance coverage. Government payers have increased their efforts to control the cost, utilization and delivery of health care services as well as reimbursement for laboratory testing services. Further reductions of reimbursement for Medicare and Medicaid services or changes in policy regarding coverage of tests or other requirements for payment, such as prior authorization or a physician or qualified practitioner\u2019s signature on test requisitions, may be implemented from time to time. Reimbursement for the laboratory services component of our business is also subject to statutory and regulatory reduction. Reductions in the reimbursement rates and changes in payment policies of other third party payers may occur as well. Such changes in the past have resulted in reduced payments as well as added costs and have decreased test utilization for the clinical laboratory industry by adding more complex new regulatory and administrative requirements. As a result, increases in the percentage of services billed to government payers could have an adverse impact on our net sales.\nWe may experience temporary disruptions and delays in processing biological samples at our facilities.\nWe may experience delays in processing biological samples caused by software and other errors. Any delay in processing samples could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur laboratories require ongoing CLIA certification.\nThe CLIA extended federal oversight to virtually all clinical laboratories by requiring that they be certified by the federal government or by a federally-approved accreditation agency. The CLIA requires that all clinical laboratories meet quality assurance, quality control and personnel standards. Laboratories must also undergo proficiency testing and are subject to inspections.\nThe sanctions for failure to comply with the CLIA requirements include suspension, revocation or limitation of a laboratory\u2019s CLIA certificate, which is necessary to conduct business, cancellation or suspension of the laboratory\u2019s approval to receive Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursement, as well as significant fines and/or criminal penalties. The loss or suspension of a CLIA certification, imposition of a fine or other penalties, or future changes in the CLIA law or regulations (or interpretation of the law or regulations) could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe believe that we are in compliance with all applicable laboratory requirements, but no assurances can be given that our laboratories will pass all future certification inspections.\nFailure to comply with HIPAA could be costly.\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (\u201cHIPAA\u201d) and associated regulations protect the privacy and security of certain patient health information and establish standards for electronic health care transactions in the United States. These privacy regulations establish federal standards regarding the uses and disclosures of protected health information. Our Molecular Labs are subject to HIPAA and its associated regulations. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations we could suffer civil and criminal penalties, fines, exclusion from participation in governmental health care programs and the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our Patient Testing business. We could also incur liabilities from third party claims.\nOur business could be adversely impacted by health care reform.\nGovernment attention to the health care industry in the United States is significant and may increase. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act passed by Congress and signed into law by President Obama in March 2010 could adversely impact our business. While certain portions of the legislation have already gone into effect, the ultimate impact of the legislation on the health care industry is still unknown, and the overall impact on our business is likely to be extensive and could result in significant changes to our business and our customers\u2019 businesses.\nWe may be subject to client lawsuits.\nProviders of clinical testing services may be subject to lawsuits alleging negligence or other legal claims. Potential suits could involve claims for substantial damages. Litigation could also have an adverse impact on our client base and our reputation. We maintain liability insurance coverage for certain claims that could result from providing or failing to provide clinical testing services, including inaccurate testing results and other exposures. Our insurance coverage limits our maximum recovery on individual claims and, therefore, there is no assurance that such coverage will be adequate.\nThe sale of our products and business operations in international markets subjects us to additional risks.\nDuring the past several years, international sales have represented a significant portion of our total net sales. As a result, a major portion of our net sales are subject to risks associated with international sales and operations. These risks include:\n\u2022\nPayment cycles in foreign markets are typically longer than in the U.S., and capital spending budgets for research agencies can vary over time with foreign governments;\n\u2022\nChanges in foreign currency exchange rates can make our products more costly in local currencies because our foreign sales are typically paid for in British Pounds or in Euros;\n\u2022\nThe potential for changes in U.S. and foreign laws or regulations that result in additional import or export restrictions, higher tariffs or other taxes, more burdensome licensing requirements or similar impediments may limit our ability to sell products and services profitably in these markets; and\n\u2022\nThe fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates to the U.S. Dollar and the Euro to the British Pound can cause our net sales and expenses to increase or decrease, which adds risk to our financial statements.\nOur dependence on our suppliers exposes us to certain risks.\nWe rely on various suppliers for products and materials to produce our products. In the event that they would be unable to deliver these items due to product shortages or business closures, we may be unable to deliver our products to our customers in a timely manner or may need to increase our prices. The current economy poses the additional risk of our suppliers\u2019 inability to continue their businesses as usual.\nOur markets are very competitive.\nMany of our competitors have greater resources than we do and may enjoy other competitive advantages. This may allow them to more effectively market their products to our customers or potential customers, to develop products that make our products obsolete or to produce and sell products less expensively than us. As a result of these competitive factors, demand for and pricing of our products and services could be negatively affected.\nOur patents may not protect us from others using our technology, which could harm our business and competitive position.\nPatent law relating to the scope of claims in the technology fields in which we operate is still evolving. The degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain. Furthermore, we cannot be certain that others will not independently develop similar or alternative products or technology, duplicate any of our products, or, if patents are issued to us, design around the patented products developed by us. Our patents or licenses could be challenged by litigation and, if the outcome of such litigation were adverse to us, our competitors could be free to use our technology. We may not be able to obtain additional patents for our technology, or if we are able to do so, patents may not provide us with adequate protection or be commercially beneficial. In addition, we could incur substantial costs in litigation if we are required to defend ourselves in patent suits brought by third parties or if we initiate such suits.\nWe cannot be certain that other measures taken to protect our intellectual property will be effective.\nWe rely upon trade secrets, copyright and trademark laws, non-disclosure agreements and other contractual confidentiality provisions to protect some of our confidential and proprietary information that we are not seeking patent protection for various reasons. Such measures, however, may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information. If such measures do not protect our rights, third parties could use our technology and our ability to compete in the market would be reduced.\nWe are dependent upon licensed technologies and may need to obtain additional licenses in the future to offer our products and remain competitive.\nWe have licensed key components of our technologies from third parties. If these agreements were to terminate prematurely due to our breach of the terms of these licenses or we otherwise fail to maintain our rights to such technologies, we may lose the right to manufacture or sell a substantial portion of our products. In addition, we may need to obtain licenses to\nadditional technologies in the future in order to keep our products competitive. If we fail to license or otherwise acquire necessary technologies, we may not be able to develop new products that we need to remain competitive.\nThe protection of intellectual property in foreign countries is uncertain.\nA significant percentage of our sales are to customers located outside the U.S. Patent and other intellectual property laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as U.S. laws. We may need to bring proceedings to defend our patent rights or to determine the validity of our competitors\u2019 foreign patents. These proceedings could result in substantial cost and diversion of our other efforts. Finally, some of the patent protections available to us in the U.S. are not available to us in foreign countries due to the laws of those countries.\nOur products could infringe on the intellectual property rights of others.\nThere are a significant number of U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications submitted for technologies in, or related to, our area of business. As a result, our use of our technology could infringe patents or proprietary rights of others. This may lead others to assert patent infringement or other intellectual property claims against us. We could incur substantial costs in litigation if we are required to defend against intellectual property claims by third parties. Additionally, any licenses that we might need as a result of any actual infringement might not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nOur failure to comply with any applicable government laws and regulations or otherwise respond to claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of hazardous chemicals that we use may adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur research and development and manufacturing activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemicals. We are subject to federal, state, local and international laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials and waste products. If we fail to comply with applicable laws or regulations, we could be required to pay penalties or be held liable for any damages that result and this liability could exceed our financial resources. We cannot be certain that accidental contamination or injury will not occur. Any such accident could damage our research and manufacturing facilities and operations, resulting in delays and increased costs.\nWe may issue a substantial amount of our common stock to holders of options and warrants and this could reduce the market price for our stock.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had obligations to issue 9,963,886 shares of common stock upon exercise of outstanding stock options, warrants or conversion rights. The issuance of these securities may be dilutive to our current stockholders and\ncould negatively impact the market price of our common stock.\nOur common stock is thinly traded and a large percentage of our shares are held by a small group of unrelated, institutional owners.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had 13,915,691 shares of common stock outstanding. The sale of a significant number of shares into the public market has the potential to cause significant downward pressure on the price of our common stock. This is particularly the case if the shares being placed into the market exceed the market\u2019s ability to absorb the stock. This presents an opportunity for short sellers to contribute to the further decline of our stock price. If there are significant short sales of our stock, the price decline that would result from this activity will cause the share price to decline more so, which, in turn, may cause long holders of the stock to sell their shares, thereby contributing to sales of our stock in the market. In addition, the large concentration of our shares are held by a small group of stockholders which could result in increased volatility in our stock price due to the limited number of shares available in the market.\nWe have previously identified material weaknesses and ineffective internal controls could impact our business and financial results.\nOur internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. In the course of auditing our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014, our independent registered public accounting firm identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting relating to proper timing and recognition of revenue and the elements used in our analysis and evaluation of the allowance for doubtful accounts to ensure that the allowance for doubtful accounts is reasonably stated. We remediated these material weaknesses in the year ended December 31, 2015.\nEven effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business and financial results could be harmed, we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations and we may not be able to accurately report financial results or prevent fraud.\nFailure to comply with covenants in our loan agreement with affiliates of Third Security, LLC could adversely affect us.\nOur revolving line of credit and term loan with affiliates of Third Security, LLC, a related party, (the \u201cLenders\u201d) are governed by a Loan and Security Agreement, which contains certain affirmative and negative covenants. Under the term loan, we are required to maintain a minimum liquidity ratio and achieve a minimum amount of revenue, and we also agreed not to (i) pledge or otherwise encumber our assets other than to the Lenders, (ii) enter into additional borrowings or guarantees, (iii) repurchase our capital stock, or (iv) enter into certain mergers or acquisitions without the Lenders\u2019 consent. To secure the repayment of amounts borrowed under the revolving line of credit and term loan, we granted the Lenders a security interest in all of our assets. Failure to comply with the covenants under the loan agreement would be an event of default under the loan agreement that, if not cured or waived, would give the Lenders the right to cease making additional advances, accelerate repayment of all sums due and take action to collect the amounts owed to them, including foreclosing on their security interest, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. As of December 31, 2015, we were not in compliance with the financial covenants of the Loan and Security Agreement.\nIf we cannot meet the continued listing requirements of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (\u201cNasdaq\u201d), Nasdaq may delist our shares of common stock, which would have an adverse impact on the trading volume, liquidity and market price of our common shares.\nOn February 23, 2016, we received written notice (the \u201cNotice\u201d) from Nasdaq indicating that, based on the closing bid price of our common stock for the preceding 30 consecutive business days, we were not in compliance with the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market (the \u201cMinimum Bid Price Requirement\u201d), as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). The Notice has no immediate effect on the listing of our common stock, and our common stock will continue to trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \u201cTBIO\u201d at this time. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we have a period of 180 calendar days, or until August 22, 2016, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. To regain compliance, the closing bid price of our common stock must meet or exceed $1.00 per share for at least ten consecutive business days during this 180 calendar day period.\nIf we are not in compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement by August 22, 2016, Nasdaq may provide us with a second 180 calendar day period to regain compliance. To qualify for the second 180 calendar day period, we would be required to (i) meet the continued listing requirement for the Nasdaq Capital Market for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for the Nasdaq Capital Market, except for the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, and (ii) notify Nasdaq of our intent to cure our noncompliance with the Minimum Bid Price, including by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary. If we do not indicate our intent to cure the deficiency or if it does not appear to Nasdaq that it would be possible for us to cure the deficiency, we would not be eligible for the second 180 calendar day period, and our common stock would then be subject to delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nIf we do not regain compliance within the allotted compliance period(s), including any extensions that may be granted by Nasdaq, Nasdaq will provide notice that our common stock will be subject to delisting. We would then be entitled to appeal the Nasdaq Staff\u2019s determination to a Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel and request a hearing.\nWe intend to monitor the closing bid price of our common stock and consider our available options to resolve our noncompliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. No determination regarding our response to the Notice has been made at this time. There can be no assurance that we will be able to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement or will otherwise be in compliance with the other listing standards for the Nasdaq Capital Market. A suspension or delisting of our common stock could adversely affect our relationships with our business partners and suppliers and customers\u2019 and potential customers\u2019 decisions to purchase our products and services, and could have a material, adverse impact on our business and operating results. In addition, a suspension or delisting could impair our ability to raise additional capital through equity or debt financings and our ability to attract and retain employees by means of equity compensation.\nIn the event of a delisting or suspension, our common stock could begin trading on the over-the-counter bulletin board, or in the so-called \u201cpink sheets.\u201d In the event of such trading, it is likely that there would be significantly less liquidity in the trading of our common stock; decreases in institutional and other investor demand for our common stock, coverage by securities analysts, market making activity and information available concerning trading prices and volume; and fewer broker-dealers willing to execute trades in our common stock. The occurrence of any of these events could result in a further decline in the market price of our common stock and could have a material adverse effect on us.", "PERMNO": 88471, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "PRPO"}
