{"cik": "61398", "company": "MAGELLAN PETROLEUM CORP /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-09-14", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information included in this report, the following risk factors should be carefully considered when evaluating an investment in us. These risk factors and other uncertainties may cause our actual future results or performance to differ materially from any future results or performance expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements contained in this report and in other public statements we make. In addition, because of these risks and uncertainties, as well as other variables affecting our operating results, our past financial performance is not necessarily indicative of future performance.\nRISKS RELATING TO TELLURIAN\u2019S BUSINESS, THE MERGER, AND THE COMBINED COMPANY FOLLOWING THE MERGER\nMagellan\u2019s business is and will be subject to risks relating to Tellurian\u2019s business, the proposed merger with Tellurian, and the combined business following the merger. For a description of these risks, see the risk factors set forth in Exhibit 99.2 to this report, which risk factors are incorporated by reference into this report and will be included in the joint proxy statement/prospectus that will form part of a registration statement on Form S-4 to be filed with the SEC shortly after the filing of this report, as such risk factors may be updated or supplemented in Magellan\u2019s subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or current reports on Form 8-K.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS\nThere is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe Company has incurred losses from operations for the year ended June 30, 2016, of $5.3 million, and as of June 30, 2016, its cash balance was $1.7 million. The Company continues to experience liquidity constraints and since July 2015, has been selling certain of its assets to fund its operations, which has resulted in a significant reduction in the Company\u2019s monthly cash burn rate. However, these liquidity constraints continue and proceeds from these asset sales may not provide sufficient liquidity to fund the Company's operations for the next twelve months. As a result of these conditions and events, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements included in this report do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or amounts of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nWe believe that upon the closing of the merger with Tellurian, the combined company will be better positioned to raise capital to fund the combined company's operations due to the attributes of Tellurian's business plan and management. Therefore, we believe that Magellan's ability to continue as a going concern in the short-term is subject to the closing of the merger with Tellurian, the primary condition of which closing is the approval by the Company\u2019s shareholders of the merger agreement that is expected to be sought in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2016. However, following the closing of the merger with Tellurian, the combined company may not be able to raise sufficient capital in a timely manner to fund the operations of the combined company. Should the merger with Tellurian not close, the Company will need to pursue other alternatives in order to continue as a going concern.\nOur current liquidity position is very constrained.\nAs of June 30, 2016, we had $1.7 million in cash and cash equivalents. The increase in cash and cash equivalents during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 primarily reflects losses incurred by operations of the Poplar field and the ongoing general and administrative expenses related to the Company's public platform and international assets, offset by cost reductions and monetization of certain assets to meet the Company's capital needs. As of September 9, 2016, our cash balances amounted to approximately $1.3 million, and we currently have a monthly cash burn rate ranging between $200 thousand and $300 thousand. Accordingly, we are facing liquidity constraints in the short term, and there is a substantial risk that we will not be able to fund our activities beyond the anticipated closing of the merger with Tellurian. Although we have been implementing cost savings initiatives to fund our activities, there is no assurance that those initiatives will be successful. For additional information, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Consolidated Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d included in this report.\nAlthough we divested our largest and only revenue-producing asset in the One Stone Exchange, we retained certain contingent liabilities associated with the asset that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a result of the closing of the One Stone Exchange, we sold to One Stone all of our interest in the Poplar field. The Poplar field comprised approximately 78% of our assets on a book value basis and was our only revenue-producing asset. However, the Purchase and Sale Agreement between us and the owners of the interests in Nautilus Technical Group, LLC and Eastern Rider, LLC provides for potential future contingent production payments, payable by us in cash to the sellers, of up to a total of $5.0 million if certain increased average daily production rates for the underlying properties are achieved. These contingent production payments remain an obligation of ours. Although the contingent production payments are unlikely to come due based on the latest reserve estimates available to us, there is no assurance that we will not be required to make such production payments in the future. If this contingent liability comes due and we are unable to dispose of it before such time, then the obligation to pay the liability could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulations related to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and operating restrictions or delays that could affect the value of our assets.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons, particularly natural gas, from tight formations. The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, sand, and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. We own interests in the Horse Hill-1 well and related licenses in the Weald Basin, onshore UK. Although the UK government lifted a temporary moratorium on hydraulic fracturing in December 2012 and an Office of Unconventional Gas and Oil has been established in the UK to coordinate the related activities of various regulatory authorities, hydraulic fracturing remains a publicly controversial topic, with media and local community concerns regarding the use of fracturing fluids, impacts on drinking water supplies, and the potential for impacts to surface water, groundwater, and the environment generally. For example, local planning permission requirements in the UK may have the effect of restricting or delaying drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing in particular. If drilling activities are restricted or delayed or made more costly, the volumes of oil and natural gas that can be economically recovered could be reduced, which would adversely affect the value of our interests.\nOur use of 2-D and 3-D seismic data is subject to interpretation and may not accurately identify the presence of oil and natural gas, which could adversely affect the results of our Australian NT/P82 prospect and other exploration and development activities.\nWe have incurred significant expenditures to acquire extensive 2-D and 3-D seismic data with respect to our NT/P82 exploration permit area in the Bonaparte Basin, offshore Northern Territory, Australia, and we use 2-D and 3-D seismic data in our other exploration and development activities. Even when properly used and interpreted, 2-D and 3-D seismic data and visualization techniques are only tools used to assist geoscientists in identifying subsurface structures and hydrocarbon indicators, and do not enable the interpreter to know whether hydrocarbons are, in fact, present in those structures. In addition, the use of 3-D seismic and other advanced technologies requires greater predrilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies, and we could incur losses as a result of such expenditures. As a result, our drilling activities may not be successful or economical.\nWe may not be successful in sharing the exploration and development costs of the fields, licenses, and permits in which we hold interests, such as our Australian NT/P82 prospect.\nDuring fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, we tried to sell or farmout our 100% interest in the NT/P82 Exploration Permit in the Bonaparte Basin, offshore Northern Territory, Australia, with the support of our financial advisor for this matter, RFC Ambrian. We were unsuccessful in executing a potential transaction, which we believe was due to i) the weak commodity price environment and material reduction in current export LNG prices in Australia, which are believed to have resulted in a significant reduction in exploration budgets of large companies operating in the area and ii) the short remaining term of the license, which was due to expire by May 12, 2016, unless the work requirements of the license had been met. In April 2016, we applied to the NOPTA to\nextend the permit term by 18 months to allow the varied minimum work condition to be undertaken. On June 29, 2016, NOPTA informed us that the Commonwealth-Northern Territory Offshore Petroleum Joint Authority approved these variations, and the term of the license is now due to end on November 12, 2017. If we are not able to secure a farm-in, farmout, or other arrangement in a timely manner, or on terms which are economically attractive to us, we may be forced to bear higher exploration and development costs with respect to our licenses and permits, in which case our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be adversely affected and the market price of our common stock could decline.\nWe may not realize the expected value and potential liquidity from our investments in Central Petroleum Limited and UK Oil and Gas Investments PLC.\nOn March 31, 2014, we sold our non-core assets in the Amadeus Basin of Australia to Central Petroleum Limited, in exchange for AUD $20.0 million in cash and 39.5 million shares of Central's stock, which are listed for trading on the Australian Securities Exchange (\"ASX\") and which represented an approximately 11% equity ownership interest in Central. Under the terms of the agreement for that transaction, the Central shares were valued at AUD $15.0 million. As of June 30, 2016, we held approximately 8.2 million Central shares, which represented an approximately 1.9% equity ownership interest in Central and were carried on our consolidated balance sheet at a fair value of $0.6 million, based on the closing per share market price for Central stock as reported on the ASX on that date and applicable foreign currency translation adjustments. On August 11, 2016, the transactions contemplated by the Weald ATA and IoW ATA closed and the Settlement Agreement with Celtique became effective, resulting in the net issuance to Magellan of approximately 50.9 million shares of UKOG, which shares are listed for trading on the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange and at the at the time of closing represented an approximately 2.0% equity ownership in UKOG and were worth approximately GBP 703 thousand.\nCentral is a Brisbane, Australia-based junior exploration and production company that operates one of the largest holdings of prospective onshore acreage in Australia. UKOG is a London-based oil and gas company focused in the Weald Basin in southern England. Accordingly, each of Central and UKOG and the value of its respective stock is subject to similar business, industry, and oil and natural gas price fluctuation risk factors that we are subject to, as well as each of Central's and UKOG's own particular risk factors based on its current circumstances and operating areas in Australia and England, respectively. As a result, or for other reasons, the market price of Central or UKOG stock may experience significant fluctuations, including significant decreases. We do not control Central or UKOG, and our investment is subject to the risk that Central or UKOG may make business, financial, or management decisions with which we do not agree. Although the shares of Central and UKOG that we hold are not restricted and may be sold on the ASX or Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange, respectively, the average daily trading volumes for Central and UKOG stock relative to the number of Central or UKOG shares that we hold may mean that our Central or UKOG shares would need to be sold over a substantial period of time, exposing our investment return to risks of downward movement in the market price during the intended disposition period. Accordingly, we may ultimately realize a lower value and potential liquidity from our investments in Central and UKOG than we expect.\nExploration and development drilling may not result in commercially producible reserves.\nCrude oil and natural gas drilling and production activities are subject to numerous risks, including the risk that no commercially producible crude oil or natural gas will be found. The cost of drilling and completing wells is often uncertain, and crude oil or natural gas drilling and production activities may be shortened, delayed, or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022\nunexpected drilling conditions;\n\u2022\ntitle problems;\n\u2022\ndisputes with owners or holders of surface interests on or near areas where we intend to drill;\n\u2022\npressure or geologic irregularities in formations;\n\u2022\nengineering and construction delays;\n\u2022\nequipment failures or accidents;\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions;\n\u2022\ncompliance with environmental and other governmental requirements; and\n\u2022\nshortages or delays in the availability of or increases in the cost of drilling rigs and crews, equipment, pipe, water, and other supplies.\nThe prevailing prices for crude oil and natural gas affect the cost of, and demand for, drilling rigs, completion and production equipment, and other related services. However, changes in costs may not occur simultaneously with corresponding changes in commodity prices. The availability of drilling rigs can vary significantly from region to region at any particular time. Although land drilling rigs can be moved from one region to another in response to changes in levels of demand, an undersupply of rigs in any region may result in drilling delays and higher drilling costs for the rigs that are available in that region. In addition, general and industry economic and financial downturns can adversely affect the financial condition of some drilling contractors, which may constrain the availability of drilling services in some areas.\nAnother significant risk inherent in drilling plans is the need to obtain drilling permits from state, local, and other governmental authorities. Delays in obtaining regulatory approvals and drilling permits, including delays that jeopardize our ability to realize the potential benefits from leased or licensed properties within the applicable lease or license periods, the failure to obtain a drilling permit for a well, or the receipt of a permit with unreasonable conditions or costs could have a material adverse effect on our ability to explore on or develop the properties we have or may acquire.\nThe wells we drill may not be productive and we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in such wells. The seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well if crude oil or natural gas is present, or whether it can be produced economically. The cost of drilling, completing, and operating a well is often uncertain, and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a project. Drilling activities can result in dry holes or wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net revenues after operating and other costs to cover initial drilling and completion costs.\nOur future drilling activities may not be successful. Although we have identified potential drilling locations, we may not be able to economically produce oil or natural gas from them.\nThe loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to operate.\nWe depend, and will continue to depend in the foreseeable future, on the services of our executive management team and other key personnel. The ability to retain officers and key employees is important to our success and growth. The unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on our business. If we cannot retain our technical personnel or attract additional experienced technical personnel and professionals, our ability to compete could be harmed.\nWe have limited management and staff and are dependent upon partnering arrangements.\nWe had 13 total employees as of June 30, 2016, and four total employees as of September 9, 2016. Due to our limited number of employees, we expect that we will continue to require the services of independent consultants and contractors to perform various professional services, including reservoir engineering, land, legal, environmental, and tax services. We also plan to pursue alliances with partners in the areas of geological and geophysical services and prospect generation, evaluation, and prospect leasing. Our dependence on third party consultants and service providers creates a number of risks, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe possibility that such third parties may not be available to us as and when needed; and\n\u2022\nthe risk that we may not be able to properly control the timing and quality of work conducted with respect to our projects.\nIf we experience significant delays in obtaining the services of such third parties or poor performance by such parties, our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nThere are risks inherent in foreign operations and investments, such as adverse changes in currency values and foreign regulations relating to MPUK's, MPA's, and Central's exploration and development operations, and potential taxes or restrictions on dividends to MPC from foreign subsidiaries or investments.\nThe properties in which we have operating or investment interests that are located outside the United States are subject to certain risks related to the indirect ownership and development of, or investment in, foreign properties, including government expropriation and nationalization, adverse changes in currency values and foreign exchange controls, foreign taxes, United States taxes on the repatriation of funds to the United States, and other laws and regulations, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our properties, investments, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Although there are currently no foreign exchange controls on the payment of dividends to MPC by its subsidiaries or other entities in which it has invested, such payments could be restricted by foreign exchange controls, if implemented.\nOil and natural gas prices are volatile. Further declines in prices could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, access to capital, and ability to grow.\nOur results of operations, future rate of growth, and the carrying value of our oil and gas properties depend heavily on the prices we receive for any crude oil and natural gas we sell. Prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital. The markets for crude oil and natural gas have historically been, and are likely to continue to be, volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to numerous factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nworldwide and domestic supplies of oil and gas, and the productive capacity of the oil and gas industry as a whole;\n\u2022\nchanges in the supply and the level of consumer demand for such fuels;\n\u2022\noverall global and domestic economic conditions;\n\u2022\npolitical conditions in oil, natural gas, and other fuel-producing and fuel-consuming areas;\n\u2022\nthe extent of UK and Australian domestic oil and gas production and the consumption and importation of such fuels and substitute fuels in UK, Australian, and other relevant markets;\n\u2022\nthe availability and capacity of gathering, transportation, processing, and/or refining facilities in regional or localized areas that may affect the realized price for crude oil or natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe price and level of foreign imports of crude oil, refined petroleum products, and liquefied natural gas;\n\u2022\nweather conditions, including effects of weather conditions on prices and supplies in worldwide energy markets;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption and conservation;\n\u2022\nthe ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other exporting countries to agree to and maintain crude oil prices and production controls;\n\u2022\nthe competitive position of each such fuel as a source of energy as compared to other energy sources;\n\u2022\nstrengthening and weakening of the US dollar relative to other currencies; and\n\u2022\nthe effect of governmental regulations and taxes on the production, transportation, and sale of oil, natural gas, and other fuels.\nThese factors and the volatility of the energy markets make it extremely difficult to predict future oil and gas price movements with any certainty, but in general we expect oil and gas prices to continue to fluctuate significantly.\nFurther and sustained declines in oil and gas prices could reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Further, oil and gas prices do not necessarily move in tandem. Future oil and gas sales would generate lower revenue if oil and natural gas prices were to continue to decline. Prices for sales of oil production are primarily affected by global oil prices, and the volatility of those prices will affect future oil revenues.\nCompetition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, and many of our competitors have greater financial, technical, and other resources than we do.\nWe face intense competition from major oil and gas companies and independent oil and gas exploration and production companies who seek oil and gas investments throughout the world, as well as the equipment, expertise, labor, and materials required to explore, develop, and operate crude oil and natural gas properties. Many of our competitors have financial, technical, and other resources vastly exceeding those available to us, and many crude oil and natural gas properties are sold in a competitive bidding process in which our competitors may be able and willing to pay more for development prospects and productive properties, or in which our competitors have technological information or expertise that is not available to us to evaluate and successfully bid for the properties. In addition, shortages of equipment, labor, or materials as a result of intense competition may result in increased costs or the inability to obtain those resources as needed. We may not be successful in acquiring, exploring, and developing profitable properties in the face of this competition.\nWe also compete for human resources. Over the last several years, the number of talented people available across all disciplines in the industry has not grown significantly, and in many cases, is declining due to the demographics of the industry.\nOur acquisitions of or investments in new oil and gas properties or other assets may not be worth what we pay due to uncertainties in evaluating recoverable reserves and other expected benefits, as well as potential liabilities.\nSuccessful property or other acquisitions or investments require an assessment of a number of factors sometimes beyond our control. These factors include exploration potential, future crude oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, and potential environmental and other liabilities. These assessments are not precise, and their accuracy is inherently uncertain.\nIn connection with our acquisitions or investments, we typically perform a customary review of the properties that will not necessarily reveal all existing or potential problems. In addition, our review may not allow us to fully assess the potential deficiencies of the properties. We do not inspect every well, and even when we inspect a well we may not discover structural, subsurface, or environmental problems that may exist or arise. We may not be entitled to contractual indemnification for pre-closing liabilities, including environmental liabilities. Normally, we acquire interests or otherwise invest in properties on an \"as is\" basis with limited remedies for breaches of representations and warranties.\nIn addition, significant acquisitions can change the nature of our operations and business if the acquired properties have substantially different operating and geological characteristics or are in different geographic locations or business sectors than our existing properties or business. To the extent acquired properties are substantially different than our existing properties or business, our ability to efficiently realize the expected economic benefits of such acquisitions may be limited.\nIntegrating acquired properties involves a number of other special risks, including the risk that management may be distracted from normal business concerns by the need to integrate operations and systems as well as retain and assimilate additional employees. Therefore, we may not be able to realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions.\nThese factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Consideration paid for any future acquisitions or investments could include our stock or require that we incur additional\ndebt and contingent liabilities. As a result, future acquisitions or investments could cause dilution of existing equity interests and earnings per share.\nOur operations are subject to complex laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations that result in substantial costs and other risks.\nUK and Australian governmental authorities, extensively regulate the oil and natural gas industry. Legislation and regulations affecting the industry are under constant review for amendment or expansion, raising the possibility of changes that may become more stringent and, as a result, may affect, among other things, the pricing or marketing of crude oil and natural gas production. Noncompliance with statutes and regulations and more vigorous enforcement of such statutes and regulations by regulatory agencies may lead to substantial administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, including the assessment of natural resource damages, the imposition of significant investigatory and remedial obligations, and may also result in the suspension or termination of our operations. The overall regulatory burden on the industry increases the cost to place, design, drill, complete, install, operate, and abandon wells and related facilities and, in turn, decreases profitability.\nGovernmental authorities regulate various aspects of drilling for and the production of crude oil and natural gas, including the permit and bonding requirements of drilling wells, the spacing of wells, the unitization or pooling of interests in crude oil and natural gas properties, rights-of-way and easements, environmental matters, occupational health and safety, the sharing of markets, production limitations, plugging, abandonment, and restoration standards, and oil and gas operations. Public interest in environmental protection has increased in recent years, and environmental organizations have opposed, with some success, certain projects. Under certain circumstances, regulatory authorities may deny a proposed permit or right-of-way or impose conditions of approval to mitigate potential environmental impacts, which could, in either case, negatively affect our ability to explore or develop certain properties. Governmental authorities also may require any of our ongoing or planned operations on their leases or licenses to be delayed, suspended, or terminated. Any such delay, suspension, or termination could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nOur operations are also subject to complex and constantly changing environmental laws and regulations adopted by governmental authorities in jurisdictions where we are engaged in exploration or production operations. New laws or regulations, or changes to current requirements, could result in material costs or claims with respect to properties we own or have owned. We will continue to be subject to uncertainty associated with new regulatory interpretations and inconsistent interpretations between various regulatory agencies. Under existing or future environmental laws and regulations, we could incur significant liability, including joint and several liability or strict liability under environmental laws for noise emissions and for discharges of crude oil, natural gas, and associated liquids or other pollutants into the air, soil, surface water, or groundwater. We could be required to spend substantial amounts on investigations, litigation, and remediation for these discharges and other compliance issues. Any unpermitted release of petroleum or other pollutants from our operations could result not only in cleanup costs but also natural resources, real or personal property, and other compensatory damages and civil and criminal liability. Existing environmental laws or regulations, as currently interpreted or enforced, or as they may be interpreted, enforced, or altered in the future, may have a material adverse effect on us.\nLegislative and regulatory initiatives related to global warming and climate change could have an adverse effect on our operations and the demand for crude oil and natural gas.\nDue to concerns about the risks of global warming and climate change, a number of various national and regional legislative and regulatory initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions are currently in various stages of discussion or implementation. Legislative and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to incur substantially increased capital, operating, maintenance, and compliance costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, costs to acquire emissions allowances, and costs to comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements. Any such legislative or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, the oil and natural gas we produce. Consequently, legislative and regulatory programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIn addition, there has been public discussion that climate change may be associated with more extreme weather conditions, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods. Extreme weather conditions can interfere with our development and production activities, increase our costs of operations or reduce the efficiency of our operations, and potentially increase costs for insurance coverage in the aftermath of such conditions. Significant physical effects of climate change could also have an indirect effect on our financing and operations by disrupting the transportation or process related services provided by midstream companies, service companies, or suppliers with whom we have a business relationship. We may not be able to recover through insurance some or any of the damages, losses, or costs that may result from potential physical effects of climate change.\nOur estimated reserves as of June 30, 2016 are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any significant inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions may materially affect the quantities and present value of such reserves.\nThis report contains estimates of our proved and probable reserves and the estimated future net revenues from our proved reserves as of June 30, 2016. All our reserves are related to the proved oil and gas properties of Poplar. As a result of the closing of the Exchange with One Stone on August 1, 2016, all our reserves were disposed of as of that date. In any case, the reserve estimates are based upon various assumptions, including assumptions required by the SEC relating to oil and gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes, and availability of funds. The process of estimating oil and gas reserves is complex. The process involves significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering, and economic data for each reservoir. Actual future production, oil and gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses, and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves will most likely vary from these estimates. Any significant variation of any nature could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our proved reserves, and the actual quantities and present value may be significantly less than we have previously estimated. Estimates of proved reserves may be adjusted to reflect production history, results of exploration and development drilling, prevailing oil and natural gas prices, costs to develop and operate properties, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, our properties may also be susceptible to hydrocarbon drainage from production by operators on adjacent properties. Probable reserves are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves.\nThe present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. We base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the average, first-day-of-the-month price during the 12-month period preceding the measurement date, in accordance with SEC rules. However, actual future net cash flows from our oil and natural gas properties also will be affected by factors such as:\n\u2022\nactual prices we receive for oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nactual costs of development and production expenditures;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of actual production;\n\u2022\nsupply of and demand for oil and natural gas; and\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulations or taxation, including severance and excise taxes.\nThe timing of production from oil and natural gas properties and of related expenses affects the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves, and thus their actual present value. In addition, the 10% discount factor required by the SEC to be used to calculate discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes may not be the most appropriate discount factor in view of actual interest rates, costs of capital, and other risks to which our business or the oil and natural gas industry in general are subject.\nSEC rules could limit our ability to book proved undeveloped reserves in the future.\nSEC rules require that, subject to limited exceptions, proved undeveloped reserves may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years after the date of booking. This requirement has limited and may continue to limit in the future our ability to book proved undeveloped reserves as we pursue drilling programs on our undeveloped properties.\nSubstantial capital is required for our business and projects.\nOur exploration, development, and acquisition activities require substantial capital expenditures. Historically, we have funded our capital expenditures through a combination of cash flows from operations, farming-in other companies or investors to our exploration and development projects in which we have an interest, sales of non-core assets, and/or debt or equity financings. Future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, such as the level of production from existing wells, prices for oil and natural gas, and our success in developing and producing new reserves. If our cash flows from operations are not sufficient to fund our planned capital expenditures, we must reduce our capital expenditures unless we can raise additional capital through debt, equity, or other financings, the divestment of assets or farm-in, farmout or other arrangements. Debt or equity financing may not always be available to us in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms, the proceeds offered to us for potential divestitures may not always be of acceptable value to us, and farm-in, farmout or other arrangements may not be available to us on terms which are economically attractive to us, or at all.\nIf we are not able to replace reserves, we will not be able to generate production.\nAll our reserves as of June 30, 2016 are related to the proved oil and gas properties of Poplar. As a result of the closing of the Exchange with One Stone on August 1, 2016, all our reserves were disposed of as of that date. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to find, develop, or acquire additional oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable. Recovery of any additional reserves will require significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations. We may not be able to successfully find and produce reserves economically in the future. In addition, we may not be able to acquire proved or probable reserves at acceptable costs.\nFuture price declines may result in further write-downs of our asset carrying values.\nWe follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas operations. Under this method, all property acquisition costs and costs of exploratory and development wells are capitalized when incurred, pending determination of whether proved reserves have been discovered. If proved reserves are not discovered with an exploratory well, the costs of drilling the well are expensed.\nThe capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties, on a depletion pool basis, cannot exceed the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows of that depletion pool. If net capitalized costs exceed undiscounted future net revenues, we generally must write down the costs of each depletion pool to the estimated fair value (discounted future net cash flows of that depletion pool). For example, in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, as a result of significant declines in oil commodity prices, we incurred an impairment loss of $7.8 million on our proved oil and gas properties included in discontinued operations. Although only $337 thousand of capitalized well costs remain as of June 30, 2016, a further significant decline in oil or natural gas prices from current levels, or other factors, could cause a further impairment write-down of capitalized costs and a non-cash charge against future earnings. Once incurred, a write-down of capitalized assets cannot be reversed at a later date, even if oil or natural gas prices increase.\nOil and gas drilling and production operations are hazardous and expose us to environmental liabilities.\nOil and gas operations are subject to many risks, including well blowouts, cratering and explosions, pipe failure, fires, formations with abnormal pressures, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, brine, or well fluids, and other environmental hazards and risks. Drilling operations involve risks from high pressures and from mechanical difficulties such as stuck pipes, collapsed casings, and separated cables. If any of these or similar events occur, we could sustain substantial losses as a result of:\n\u2022\ninjury or loss of life;\n\u2022\nsevere damage to, or destruction of, property, natural resources, and equipment;\n\u2022\npollution or other environmental damage;\n\u2022\nclean-up responsibilities;\n\u2022\nregulatory investigations and penalties; and\n\u2022\nsuspension of operations.\nOur liability for environmental hazards may include those created either by the previous owners of properties that we purchase, lease, or license, or by acquired companies prior to the date we acquire them. We maintain insurance against some, but not all, of the risks described above. Our insurance may not be adequate to cover casualty losses or liabilities, and in the future we may not be able to obtain insurance at premium levels that justify its purchase.\nWeakness in economic conditions or uncertainty in financial markets may have material adverse impacts on our business that we cannot predict.\nIn recent years, the US, UK, Australian, and global economies and financial systems have experienced turmoil and upheaval characterized by extreme volatility and declines in prices of securities, diminished liquidity and credit availability, inability to access capital markets, the bankruptcy, failure, collapse, or sale of financial institutions, increased levels of unemployment, and an unprecedented level of government intervention. Although some portions of the economy appear to have stabilized and may be recovering, the extent and timing of a recovery, and whether it can be sustained, are uncertain. Renewed weakness in the UK, Australian, or other large economies could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIn addition, some of our oil and gas properties in the United Kingdom are operated by third parties that we depend on for timely performance of drilling and other contractual obligations and, in some cases, for distribution to us of our proportionate share of revenues from sales of oil and natural gas production. If weak economic conditions adversely impact our third party operators, we are exposed to the risk that drilling operations or revenue disbursements to us could be delayed or suspended.\nWe have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate.\nSome of the UK properties in which we have an ownership interest are operated by other companies. As a result, we have limited ability to exercise influence over, and control the risks associated with, the development and operation of those properties. The timing and success of drilling and development activities on those properties depend on a number of factors outside of our control, including the operator's:\n\u2022\ndetermination of the nature and timing of flow test, drilling and operational activities;\n\u2022\ndetermination of the timing and amount of capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nexpertise and financial resources;\n\u2022\napproval of other participants in drilling wells; and\n\u2022\nselection of suitable technology.\nThe failure of an operator of our properties to adequately perform development and operational activities, an operator's breach of the applicable agreements, or an operator's failure to act in ways that are in our best interests could reduce production, revenues, and reserves, and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations may negatively affect our operating results.\nThe exchange rates between the US dollar and the British pound, as well as the exchange rates between the Australian dollar and the US dollar, have fluctuated in recent periods and may fluctuate substantially in the future. Because of our UK development program, a portion of our expenses, including exploration costs and capital and operating expenditures, will continue to be denominated in British pounds. Accordingly, any material appreciation of the British pound against the US dollar could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Our foreign exchange transaction loss for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, was $234 thousand and is included under general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations.\nProposed changes to US tax laws, if adopted, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe US President's budget proposals have included recommendations that would, if enacted, make significant changes to US tax laws applicable to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies, and legislation has been previously introduced in the US Congress that would implement many of these proposals. These proposed changes include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\neliminating the current deduction for intangible drilling and development costs;\n\u2022\neliminating the deduction for certain US production activities for oil and natural gas production;\n\u2022\nrepealing the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties; and\n\u2022\nextending the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures.\nThese proposed changes in the US tax laws, if adopted, or other similar changes that reduce or eliminate deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nCertain of our interests in the United Kingdom and Australia are subject to licenses that could be forfeited if certain drilling requirements are not met.\nWe own certain interests in the UK that are subject to licenses issued by the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change under the UK Petroleum Act 1998. In addition, we own a 100% interest in the NT/P82 Exploration Permit in the Bonaparte Basin, offshore Northern Territory, Australia, issued by the Commonwealth-Northern Territory Offshore Petroleum Joint Authority that is subject to certain terms. In order to retain the interests granted by the licenses and permit, we are required to meet certain drilling, expenditure or seismic requirements. If the applicable requirements are not met or waived, the interests granted by the licenses or permit must be forfeited.\nIn the UK, with respect to PEDLs 137 and 246, we and our partners negotiated with the OGA an amendment to the terms of the licenses, whereby for PEDL 137, the expiration of the second exploration term was extended to September 30, 2016, and for PEDL 246, the expiration of the initial exploration term was extended to June 30, 2016, and the expiration of the second exploration term was extended to June 30, 2019. Following the successful results of the flow test at the HH-1, the OGA and Secretary of State approved the work plan for each of these licenses (extending the expiration dates for PEDLs 137 and 246 to June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017, respectively) and the creation of retention areas covering the entire geographic area of them, which retention areas effectively replace the second term of the licenses.\nIn the case of the Australian NT/P82 prospect, the term of the license was due to expire by May 12, 2016, unless the work requirements of the license had been met. In April 2016, we applied to the NOPTA to extend the permit term by 18 months to allow the minimum work condition to be undertaken. On June 29, 2016, NOPTA informed us that the Commonwealth-Northern Territory Offshore Petroleum Joint Authority approved the extension of the term of the license to November 12, 2017.\nConservation measures and technological advances could reduce demand for oil and natural gas.\nFuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas, and technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices could reduce demand for oil and natural gas. The impact of changing demand for oil and natural gas may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, which may make certain projects uneconomical and/or result in losses for investors.\nDuring the past several years, the stock markets in general and for oil and gas exploration and production companies in particular have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating results and asset values of the underlying companies. In addition, due to relatively low trading volumes for our common stock, the market price for our common stock may fluctuate significantly more than the markets as a whole. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors, including factors beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022\nchanges in crude oil or natural gas commodity prices;\n\u2022\nour quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u2022\ninvestment recommendations by securities analysts following our business or our industry;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\nchanges in the business, earnings estimates, or market perceptions of comparable companies;\n\u2022\nchanges in industry, general market, or regional or global economic conditions; and\n\u2022\nannouncements of legislative or regulatory changes affecting our business or our industry.\nFluctuations in the market price of our common stock may be significant and may make certain projects uneconomical and/or result in losses for investors.\nWe may issue a significant number of shares of common stock under outstanding stock options and future equity awards under our 2012 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan, and common stockholders may be adversely affected by the issuance and sale of those shares.\nAs of June 30, 2016, we had 726,973 stock options outstanding, of which 384,528 were fully vested and exercisable. As of that date, there were 306,481 shares of common stock remaining available for future awards under our 2012 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan. If all of the 726,973 outstanding stock options, which have exercise prices ranging from $8.12 to $16.76 per share, are exercised, the shares of common stock issued would represent approximately 11% of the outstanding common shares. Sales of those shares could adversely affect the market price of our common stock, even if our business is doing well.\nIf our common stock is delisted from the NASDAQ Capital Market, its liquidity and value could be reduced.\nIn order for us to maintain the listing of our shares of common stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market, our stockholders' equity must meet the minimum $2.5 million required for continued listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market pursuant to NASDAQ Stock Market Rule 5550(b)(1). On May 17, 2016, we received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of the NASDAQ Stock Market indicating that our stockholders\u2019 equity as reported in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2016 did not meet the minimum $2.5 million required for continued listing. After we submitted a plan to the NASDAQ Stock Market to regain compliance, on July 29, 2016, we received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of the NASDAQ Stock Market indicating that it had determined to grant us an extension until October 14, 2016 to regain compliance with Rule 5550(b). We believe that the combination of the One Stone exchange, the sale of the Mereenie Bonus and the Weald ATA should result in an increase of our stockholders\u2019 equity sufficient to achieve compliance. As of June 30, 2016, pro forma for the One Stone Exchange closing and the sale of the Central Weald and Peripheral Weald licenses closing, our stockholders\u2019 equity was $3.7 million.\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement with Tellurian, it is a condition to the completion of the Merger that the shares of Magellan common stock to be issued to Tellurian stockholders pursuant to the Merger be authorized for listing to be traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market, subject to official notice of issuance.\nIf our common stock were delisted from trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market, it may be eligible for trading on the OTCQB, but the delisting of our common stock could adversely impact the liquidity and value of our common stock and our ability to raise capital or consummate the merger with Tellurian.\nThe reverse stock split of our shares of common stock may have reduced and may continue to limit the market trading liquidity of the shares due to the reduced number of shares outstanding, and may potentially have an anti-takeover effect.\nIn July 2015, we effected a one share for eight shares reverse stock split of common stock in order to increase the bid price to more than $1.00 per share and thus maintain the listing for our common stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market. Although the reverse stock split was intended to avoid decreased liquidity for the shares in the event of a delisting from the NASDAQ Capital Market, the liquidity of the shares may be adversely affected by the reverse stock split as a result of the\nreduced number of shares outstanding following the reverse stock split. In addition, the reverse stock split may have increased the number of stockholders who own odd lots (less than 100 shares) of our common stock, creating the potential for such stockholders to experience an increase in the cost of selling their shares and greater difficulty effecting such sales. Further, since the stockholder-approved reverse stock split was accomplished without a corresponding reduction in the number of shares authorized for issuance under our certificate of incorporation, the relative increase in the number of shares authorized for issuance could, under certain circumstances, have an anti-takeover effect by enabling the Board of Directors to issue additional shares of common stock in a transaction making it more difficult for a party to obtain control of us by tender offer or other means.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, and therefore only appreciation of the price of our common stock will provide a return to our common stockholders.\nWe currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings, if any, to reduce our accumulated deficit and finance the growth and development of our business. Any future determination as to the declaration and payment of cash dividends on our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our financial condition, results of operations, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects, and any other factors that our board determines to be relevant. As a result, only appreciation of the price of our common stock, which may not occur, will provide a return to our common stockholders.\nProvisions in our charter documents and Delaware law make it more difficult to effect a change in control of our company, which could prevent stockholders from receiving a takeover premium on their investment.\nWe are a Delaware corporation, and the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose various barriers to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change of control would be attractive to our existing stockholders. In addition, our certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain several provisions that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us without the approval of our board of directors. These provisions may make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding common stock. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u2022\nauthorize us to issue preferred stock that can be created and issued by the board of directors without prior stockholder approval, with rights senior to those of the common stock;\n\u2022\nclassify our board of directors so that only some of our directors are elected each year;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholders from calling special meetings of stockholders; and\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for submitting nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting.\nThese provisions also may delay, prevent, or deter a merger, acquisition, tender offer, proxy contest, or other transaction that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price of their common stock.", "PERMNO": 89790, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "TELL"}
