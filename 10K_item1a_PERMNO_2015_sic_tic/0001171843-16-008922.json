RISK FACTORS.\nRisks Related to Our General Business\nWe may not be able to continue as a going concern if we do not obtain additional financing.\nOur recurring losses from operations and our stockholders\u2019 deficit raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, and our independent accountants\u2019 audit report for the year ended December 31, 2015 states that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is highly dependent upon obtaining additional financing for our operations as well as the disposition of our ancillary network business on favorable terms. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise any additional funds, or if we are able to raise additional funds, that such funds will be in the amounts required or on terms favorable to us. In addition, the perception that we may not be able to continue as a going concern may cause others to choose not to deal with us due to concerns about our ability to meet our contractual obligations and may adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital.\nWe have incurred losses in most of our years of operation, and we may never be profitable again, despite our new business strategy.\nWith the exception of the years 2008, 2009 and 2010, we have incurred losses in each year since our inception. At December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $35.2 million. We incurred a net loss of $13.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, and losses are continuing through the date hereof. All losses prior to the second half of 2014 were attributable to our ancillary network business. Our prospects in the ancillary network business must be considered in light of the numerous risks, expenses, delays and difficulties frequently encountered in a highly-competitive, consolidating industry as well as the risks inherent in our management arrangement with HealthSmart. No assurances can be given that our future revenue from the ancillary network business will not continue to decline, which will result in continued operating losses.\nWe announced our entry into the urgent and primary care market in April 2014. We incurred losses of approximately $5.2 million from this business segment for the year ended December 31, 2015. Although we plan to grow and operate the urgent and primary care business profitably, no assurances can be given that our efforts will be successful.\nWe will require additional capital to fund our operating and expansion costs, and our inability to obtain such capital will likely harm our business.\nWe will require additional capital to fund our urgent and primary care growth and expansion plans. We may also need additional capital if we are unable to exit the ancillary network business or if we are unable to operate our urgent and primary care business profitably. Furthermore, if the profit we receive from our two business lines is not sufficient to cover our central overhead costs, we will also need additional capital. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing in a timely manner, on favorable terms or at all.\nIf additional financing is not available on satisfactory terms or at all, we may be unable to expand our business or acquire new centers at our projected rate, or at all, and our operating results may suffer. Debt financing increases expenses and must be repaid regardless of operating results and may impose restrictions on the manner in which we operate our business. Equity financing, or debt financing that is convertible into equity, could result in additional dilution to our existing stockholders. Furthermore, if we are unable to obtain adequate capital, whether in the form of equity or debt, to fund our business and growth strategies we may be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our expansion plans, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, or prospects.\nThere is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining sufficient capital financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or, if we did obtain capital financing, that it would not be dilutive to current stockholders.\nWe may need to raise additional capital to satisfy our indebtedness.\nOur indebtedness to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, or Wells Fargo, under our credit agreements, which totaled $11.1 million at December 31, 2015, matures in part on June 1, 2016 ($5.0 million) and on October 1, 2016 (remainder). If we are unable to extend or refinance the Wells Fargo debt, we will need to raise additional capital to repay Wells Fargo on the applicable maturity dates. In addition, our indebtedness to sellers of urgent and primary care centers that we acquired in 2014 and 2015 now totals approximately $0.7 million and is payable at varying times and in varying amounts until June 2017. We can provide no assurances that any additional sources of financing will be available to us on favorable terms, if at all, to repay our indebtedness or for any other purpose. Our failure to raise a sufficient amount of additional capital may significantly impact our ability to operate and expand our business and would create substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.. For further discussion of our liquidity requirements, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources,\u201d included elsewhere in this report.\nOur subleases, management services agreement and other contractual arrangements may not result in our realizing the financial benefits of direct ownership of Medac and may not be as effective as direct ownership in providing managerial control over Medac.\nThere is a risk that state authorities in some jurisdictions, including North Carolina, may find that certain of our contractual relationships, including those entered into in connection with the Medac Asset Acquisition, violate laws prohibiting the corporate practice of medicine and fee-splitting arrangements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our common stock. These laws are generally intended to prevent unlicensed persons or entities from interfering with or inappropriately influencing a physician\u2019s professional judgment and may prevent or limit the sharing or assignment of income generated by certain of our physicians. See \u201cBusiness - Our Urgent Care and Primary Care Business - Government Regulation - Our Urgent and Primary Care Business - State Laws Regarding Prohibition of Corporate Practice of Medicine and Fee Splitting Arrangements.\u201d\nUnder applicable state law, we are prohibited from directly owning an interest in a medical practice in North Carolina, including Medac. Accordingly, we are realizing the benefit of the Medac Asset Acquisition though our subleases, management services agreement and other contractual arrangements. These arrangements may not be as effective as direct ownership in providing us with the financial benefits of or managerial control over Medac. For example, with limited exceptions, the annual consideration due to us under the subleases, management services agreement and other contractual arrangements must be set in advance, which could result in our receipt of less than all of Medac\u2019s annual earnings. Additionally, because we do not consolidate Medac for income tax purposes, we may be unable to receive the benefit of any tax losses accrued by Medac. In the event we or our contractual arrangements are found to violate applicable North Carolina law, such contractual arrangements could be deemed void and unenforceable as a matter of law, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flow and financial condition.\nIf we had direct ownership of Medac, we would be able to exercise our rights as an equity holder directly to effect changes to the board of directors of Medac, which could effect changes at the management and operational levels. With our contractual arrangements, we may not be able to directly change the members of the board of directors of Medac and will have to rely on the rights provided in our subleases, management services agreement and other contractual arrangements for such purposes. The parties to our subleases, management services agreement and other contractual arrangements may have conflicts of interest with us or our stockholders, and they may not act in our best interests or may not perform their obligations under these contracts. Such risks will exist throughout the period in which we manage Medac through such contractual arrangements unless a change in the law is enacted. If any dispute relating to such contracts remained unresolved, we would have to enforce our rights under these contracts under state law through arbitration, litigation and other legal proceedings and therefore will be subject to uncertainties in the legal system. Any such dispute could result in the ultimate termination of such contracts, which would require that we identify a new medical company to operate the clinical aspects of the business. Therefore, our subleases, management services agreement and other contractual arrangements may not be as effective in ensuring our financial rights or control over the relevant portion of Medac\u2019s business operations as direct ownership would be.\nWe have experienced significant turnover in our senior management and our business may be adversely affected by the transitions in our senior management team or by our inability to effectively handle our transition and any future succession planning.\nWe are highly dependent on the executive leadership of our senior management and key employees and their extensive experience in the urgent and primary care industry, as well as their extensive knowledge of healthcare operations and center acquisitions. Our success depends, in large part, on the contributions and strategic vision of our senior management team as well as those other key personnel who manage our operations. In October 2014, we received resignation notices from our then-serving Chief Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer after we announced the relocation of our corporate headquarters from Dallas, Texas to Atlanta, Georgia; in April 2015, our President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Richard W. Turner, Ph.D., died unexpectedly; in July 2015, our then-serving Chief Financial Officer announced his resignation; and in January 2016, our President and Chief Operating Officer announced his resignation. On January 8, 2016, our Board of Directors appointed Adam S. Winger to serve as our President and Chief Executive Officer and appointed James A. Honn to the additional position of Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Winger has continuously served us in several capacities during the period from July 2014 until January 2016, including as our Vice President of Acquisitions, Secretary, Interim Chief Financial Officer and General Counsel. Mr. Honn has served as our Chief Information Officer since April 2013. In March 2016, Robert Frye, our Controller and Principal Accounting Officer, was appointed to serve as our Interim Chief Financial Officer.\nThese transitions in our executive team have been disruptive to our business, and if we are unable to manage orderly transitions, our business may continue to be adversely affected. Additionally, the loss of other members of our senior management team or key personnel could harm our ability to implement our business strategy and respond to the rapidly changing market conditions in which we operate. There may be a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions, and we cannot assure you that we would be able to identify or employ such qualified personnel on acceptable terms, if at all. The search for permanent replacements could also result in significant recruiting and relocation costs. If we fail to successfully attract and appoint a permanent Chief Financial Officer with the appropriate expertise, we could experience increased employee turnover and harm to our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nOur business depends on numerous complex information systems, and any failure to successfully maintain these systems or implement new systems could materially harm our operations.\nWe depend on complex, integrated information systems and standardized procedures for operational and financial information. We may not have the necessary resources to enhance existing information systems or implement new systems where necessary to handle our needs. Furthermore, we may experience unanticipated delays, complications and expenses in implementing, integrating and operating our systems. Any interruptions in operations during periods of implementation would adversely affect our ability to properly allocate resources and process information in a timely manner, which could result in customer dissatisfaction and delayed cash flow. In addition, our technology systems, or a disruption in the operation of such systems, could be subject to physical or electronic break-ins, and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering. The failure to successfully implement and maintain operational, financial and billing information systems could have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain new business, retain existing business and maintain or increase our profit margins.\nA failure in or a breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of the third party vendors and other service providers or other third parties with which we transact business, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could disrupt our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs or cause losses.\nWe rely on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Information security risks have generally increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, and terrorists, activists, and other external parties. Our business, financial, accounting, and data processing systems, or other operating systems and facilities may stop operating properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control.\nAlthough we have information security procedures and controls in place, our technologies, systems and networks and our payors\u2019 systems may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss, or destruction of our or our payors\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 confidential information.\nAlthough we have disaster recovery and other policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption or security breach of our information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur or, if, they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. We may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate information security vulnerabilities. Disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our business, or cyber-attacks or security breaches of our networks, systems or devices could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe may not be able to adequately secure or protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights that are material to our business, or to defend successfully against intellectual property infringement claims by third parties.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends in part upon our intellectual property rights, including but not limited to our trademarks. Our use of contractual provisions, confidentiality procedures and agreements, and trademark, copyright, unfair competition, trade secret and other laws to protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, or to defend against claims by third parties that the conduct of our businesses or our use of intellectual property infringes upon such third party\u2019s intellectual property rights. For example, in 2015 a complaint was filed against us in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama by American Family Care, Inc. and Irwin Holdings, LLC. The complaint alleged, among other things, that our use of the trade name \u201cAmerican CareSource\u201d in the urgent and primary care business infringed upon their trademark, \u201cAmerican Family Care.\u201d The parties settled the dispute and the court dismissed the case. Any intellectual property litigation or claims brought against us, whether or not meritorious, could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources, and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained in all cases. The terms of any settlement or judgment may require us to pay substantial amounts to the other party or cease exercising our rights in such intellectual property, including ceasing the use of certain trademarks used by us to distinguish our services from those of others or ceasing the exercise of our rights in copyrightable works. In addition, we may have to seek a license to continue practices found to be in violation of a third party\u2019s rights, which may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result.\nThe credit agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to respond to changes in market conditions or pursue business opportunities.\nOur credit agreements contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u00b7 incur additional secured indebtedness other than purchase money indebtedness not to exceed $1.5 million in the aggregate;\n\u00b7 merge or consolidate with another entity;\n\u00b7 pay dividends or make other distributions;\n\u00b7 make additional investments in fixed assets in any year in excess of $1.5 million, unless such additional investments are made in connection with our acquisition of all or substantially all of another company\u2019s fixed assets;\n\u00b7 guarantee obligations of any other person or entity;\n\u00b7 mortgage or pledge any of our assets except liens securing permitted purchase money indebtedness; or\n\u00b7 make any loans or advances, excluding any loan or advance made to Medac Health Services, P.A., up to $1 million.\nWe also cannot assure you that any third party or unaffiliated guarantors will permit us to respond to changes in market conditions or pursue business opportunities.\nThe limitation on additional investments in fixed assets could limit our ability to execute our de novo clinic growth strategy if the lender does not waive compliance with this covenant. The requirement that we comply with these provisions may materially adversely affect our ability to react to changes in market conditions, take advantage of business opportunities we believe to be desirable, obtain future financing, fund desired capital expenditures or withstand a continuing or future downturn in our business.\nIf we are unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants in our credit agreements, there could be an event of default under the terms of such agreements, which could result in an acceleration of repayment.\nOur ability to comply with the restrictions and covenants in our credit agreements may be affected by events beyond our control. For example, in April 2015, we received notice from Wells Fargo that an event of default had occurred under our July 2014 credit agreement following the unexpected death of our then President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Richard W. Turner, who had guaranteed part of our indebtedness under the July 2014 credit agreement. Although that event of default was cured to the satisfaction of Wells Fargo, and Wells Fargo notified us that it will not enforce its rights and remedies related to Dr. Turner\u2019s death, we cannot assure you that in the future we or our guarantors will be willing or able to comply with the restrictions and covenants in our credit agreements, or that any future events of default will be waived. In the event of a default under our credit agreements, the lender could terminate its commitment to lend or could accelerate the loan and declare all amounts borrowed due and payable. If any of these events occur, we could be forced to liquidate all or a portion of our assets, which might not be sufficient to repay in full all of our outstanding indebtedness and we may be unable to find alternative financing. Even if we could obtain alternative financing, it might not be on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us. Additionally, we may not be able to amend our credit agreements or obtain needed waivers on satisfactory terms.\nOur borrowing under our credit agreements exposes us to interest rate risk.\nOur results of operations are exposed to interest rate risk associated with borrowing under our credit agreements, which bear interest at daily one month London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus 1.75%. By its nature, a variable interest rate will move up or down based on changes in the economy and other factors, all of which are beyond our control. If interest rates increase, so will our interest costs, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows available for working capital and capital expenditures, and our overall financial condition.\nWe may be adversely affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors beyond our control.\nOur ability to attract and retain patients, invest in and grow our business and meet our financial objectives and obligations depends on our operating and financial performance, which, in turn, is subject to numerous factors, including the prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors beyond our control, such as the rate of unemployment, the extent and severity of illness, the number of uninsured persons in the United States and inflationary pressures. We cannot anticipate all the ways in which the current economic climate and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business.\nThe financial instability of our patients, many of whom may be adversely affected by volatile economic conditions, could present a variety of risks that are beyond our control. For example, unemployment and underemployment, and the resultant loss of insurance, may decrease the demand for healthcare services and pharmaceuticals. If fewer patients are seeking medical care because they do not have insurance coverage, our centers may experience reductions in revenues, profitability or cash flow. This, in turn, could adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity. In addition, widespread and prolonged unemployment, notwithstanding the enforceability of the ACA could result in a substantial number of people becoming uninsured or underinsured. In turn, this may lead to fewer individuals pursuing or being able to afford our services. To the extent prevailing economic conditions result in fewer patients being treated, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to limitations.\nIn general, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50% change by value in its equity ownership over a three-year period, is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses, or NOLs. As of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, our NOL carryforwards were approximately $31.6 million, $19.6 million and $14.5 million, respectively, which expire from 2025 through 2034. Our existing NOL carryforwards may be subject to limitations arising from previous ownership changes. Either alone, or when aggregated with past transactions, future changes in our stock ownership, some of which might be beyond our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code. In the event we are deemed to experience such a change in control, we may not be able to utilize some or all of the NOL carryforwards for state or federal income tax purposes even if we attain profitability.\nRisks Related to Our Urgent and Primary Care Business\nWe may not be able to implement successfully our growth strategy for our urgent and primary care business on a timely basis or at all, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe growth of our urgent and primary care business depends on our ability to execute our plan to open and acquire new centers. Our ability to acquire and open profitable centers depends on many factors, including our ability to:\n\u00b7 access capital to fund future acquisitions and preopening expenses;\n\u00b7 successfully identify and secure leases for sites in desirable locations;\n\u00b7 achieve brand awareness in new and existing markets;\n\u00b7 manage costs, which could give rise to delays or cost overruns;\n\u00b7 recruit, train, and retain qualified physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, nurses, medical technologists and other staff in our local markets;\n\u00b7 obtain favorable reimbursement rates for services rendered at the centers;\n\u00b7 successfully staff and operate new centers;\n\u00b7 obtain all required governmental approvals, certificates, licenses and permits on a timely basis;\n\u00b7 manage delays in the acquisition or opening of centers;\n\u00b7 outperform local competitors; and\n\u00b7 maintain adequate information systems and other operational system capabilities.\nFurther, applicable laws, rules and regulations (including licensure requirements) could negatively impact our ability to operate both new and existing centers.\nAccordingly, we may not be able to achieve our planned growth or, even if we are able to grow our center base as planned, any new centers may not be profitable or otherwise perform as planned. Failure to implement successfully our growth strategy would likely have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are operating a new business line, and management has limited experience operating such a line for us.\nOur urgent and primary care business is a new business line for us, and members of our management team do not have substantial experience operating in this segment with our Company. As a result, our historical financial results may not be comparable to future results. Also, we may be subject to risks that we are unable to presently identify, such as regulatory risks. We cannot assure you that management will be able to profitably operate our urgent and primary care business. Such failure may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe long-term success of our urgent and primary care business is highly dependent on our ability to successfully identify and acquire target centers and open new centers.\nTo achieve our growth strategy, we will need to acquire and open new centers and operate them on a profitable basis. We take into account numerous factors in identifying target markets where we can enter or expand.\nThe number and timing of new centers acquired and opened during any given period may be negatively impacted by a number of factors including, without limitation:\n\u00b7 the identification and availability of attractive sites for new centers and the ability to negotiate suitable lease terms;\n\u00b7 our ability to successfully identify and address pertinent risks and benefits during acquisition due diligence;\n\u00b7 the preparation of target centers\u2019 financial statements using methods of accounting other than generally accepted accounting principles;\n\u00b7 the proximity of potential sites to one of our or our competitors\u2019 existing centers;\n\u00b7 our ability to obtain required governmental licenses, permits and authorizations on a timely basis; and\n\u00b7 our ability to recruit qualified physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, nurses, medical technologists and other personnel to staff our centers.\nIf we are unable to find and secure attractive target centers to expand in existing markets or enter new markets, our revenues and profitability may be harmed, we may not be able to implement our growth strategy and our financial results may be negatively affected.\nOur acquisition, integration and opening of centers in new markets exposes us to various risks and may require us to develop new business models.\nOur growth and profitability depend on our ability to successfully implement our growth strategy by expanding the number of centers we operate in both new and existing markets. We cannot assure you that our efforts to expand into new markets, particularly where we do not currently operate, will succeed. To operate in new markets, we may be required to modify our existing business model and cost structure to comply with local regulatory or other requirements, which may expose us to new operational, regulatory or legal risks.\nWe may be unable to acquire target centers within our current price ranges. This may reduce the pace of our growth and increase the need for additional debt and equity capital. The patient population of centers we acquire may be loyal to existing ownership, making it difficult to maintain pre-closing revenue and profit levels. The re-branding of acquired centers may have an adverse market effect in local communities, and our brand may not be received as favorably in the local communities as we anticipate.\nThe process of integration of an acquired center may subject us to a number of risks, including:\n\u00b7 failure to successfully manage relationships with physicians and other staff of the acquired center;\n\u00b7 demands on management related to the increase in size of our Company after the acquisition;\n\u00b7 diversion of management attention from the operation of our business;\n\u00b7 potential difficulties integrating and harmonizing financial reporting systems;\n\u00b7 regulatory and compliance risks;\n\u00b7 difficulties in the assimilation and retention of employees;\n\u00b7 inability to retain the physicians and other staff of the acquired center;\n\u00b7 inability to establish uniform standards, controls, systems, procedures and policies;\n\u00b7 inability to retain the patients of the acquired center;\n\u00b7 inability to improve our operational systems sufficiently to support the expansion of our operations to achieve economies of scale in order to improve operating margins;\n\u00b7 exposure to legal claims for activities of the acquired center prior to acquisition; and\n\u00b7 incurrence of additional expenses in connection with the integration process.\nIf we are unable to successfully integrate acquired centers or if there are delays in integration, the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected.\nAdditionally, centers we open in new markets may take longer to reach expected revenue and profit levels on a consistent basis. The cost of opening and operating new centers may exceed our budget, thereby affecting our overall profitability. New markets may have competitive conditions, consumer preferences, and healthcare spending patterns that are more difficult to predict, identify or satisfy than our existing markets. We may need to make greater investments than we originally planned in advertising and promotional activity in new markets and after closing acquisitions to build brand awareness. We may find it more difficult in new markets to hire, and we may not be able to retain and motivate, qualified physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, medical technologists and other personnel. We may need to augment our labor model to meet regulatory requirements and the overall cost of labor may increase or be higher than anticipated.\nAs a result of any of the foregoing, any new or acquired centers may be less successful than expected, may not achieve target profit margins or our growth objectives and our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf we open new centers in existing markets, revenue at our existing centers may be affected negatively.\nThe number and type of patients using our centers varies by location and depends on a number of factors, including population density, availability of other sources for convenient medical services, area demographics and geography. The opening of a new center in or near our existing centers could adversely affect the revenues of those existing centers. Existing centers could also make it more difficult to build our patient base for a new center in the same market. We may selectively open new centers in and around areas of existing centers that are operating at or near capacity to serve effectively our patients, but revenue cannibalization between our centers may become significant in the future as competition increases and as we continue to expand our operations. This could adversely affect our revenue growth, which could, in turn, adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may be required to make capital expenditures in connection with our acquisitions to implement our growth strategy.\nIn order to effectively integrate our acquired centers, we may need to make significant capital expenditures to the interior and exterior of those centers. This may include making real property improvements and upgrading our medical equipment to serve our patients and remain competitive. Changing competitive conditions or the emergence of significant advances in medical technology could require us to invest significant capital in additional equipment or capacity in order to remain competitive. Along these lines, if the systems and technology of our target centers differ from those we have chosen to utilize, we may be required to invest significant capital to either convert, terminate, or integrate the varying technology platforms. If we are unable to fund any such investment or otherwise fail to make necessary capital expenditures, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nDamage to our reputation or our brand could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe must grow the value of our brand to be successful. We intend to develop a reputation based on the high quality of our medical services and clinic personnel, as well as on our unique culture and the experience of our patients in our centers. If we do not make investments in areas such as marketing and advertising, as well as the day-to-day investments required for center operations, equipment upgrades, and personnel training, the value of our brand may not increase or may be diminished. Any incident, real or perceived, regardless of merit or outcome, that adversely affects our brand, such as, but not limited to, patient disability or death due to medical malpractice or allegations of medical malpractice, failure to comply with federal, state, or local regulations, including allegations or perceptions of non-compliance or failure to comply with ethical and operational standards, could significantly reduce the value of our brand, expose us to negative publicity and damage our overall business and reputation.\nOur marketing activities may not be successful.\nWe incur costs and expend other resources in our marketing efforts to attract and retain patients. Our marketing activities are principally focused on increasing brand awareness in the communities in which we provide services. As we open and acquire new centers, we expect to undertake aggressive marketing campaigns to increase community awareness about our presence and our service capabilities. We conduct our targeted marketing efforts in neighborhoods through channels such as direct mail, billboards, radio advertisements, physician open houses, community sponsorships and various social media. If we are not successful in these efforts, we will have incurred expenses without materially increasing revenue.\nThe urgent and primary care market is highly competitive, including competition for patients, strategic relationships, and commercial payor contracts.\nThe market for providing urgent care and primary care services is highly competitive. Our centers face competition from existing walk-in clinics, hospital emergency rooms, private doctors\u2019 offices, freestanding emergency centers, independent laboratories, occupational medicine clinics, in-store clinics, and hospital- and payor-supported urgent care facilities, depending on the type of patient and geographic market. Our centers compete on the basis of quality, price, accessibility, and overall experience. We compete with national, regional, and local enterprises, many of which have greater financial and other resources available to them, greater access to physicians or greater access to potential patients. We also compete on the basis of our multistate, regional footprint, which we believe will be of value to both employers and third-party payors. As a result of the differing competitive factors within the markets in which we operate and will operate, the individual results of our centers may be adversely affected. If we are unable to compete effectively with any of these entities or groups, or we are unable to implement our business strategies, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to recruit and retain qualified physicians and other healthcare professionals for our urgent and primary care centers.\nOur success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain qualified physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, nurses, medical technologists and other staff. There is currently a national shortage of certain of these healthcare professionals. To the extent a significant number of physicians within an individual community or market decides to partner with our competitors and not with us, we may not be able to operate our centers in such community. We face competition for such personnel from existing urgent and primary care operators, hospital systems, entrepreneurial start-ups, and other organizations. This competition may require us to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain qualified personnel. Our inability to recruit and retain these professionals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow or be profitable.\nWe may not be able to prohibit or limit our physicians and other healthcare professionals from competing with us in our local markets.\nIn certain states in which we operate or intend to operate, non-compete, non-solicitation, and other negative covenants applicable to employment or ownership are judicially or statutorily limited in their effectiveness or are entirely unenforceable against physicians and other healthcare professionals. As a result, we may not be able to retain our patient relationships or protect our market share, operational processes or procedures, or limit insiders from using competitive information against us or competing with us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and ability to remain competitive.\nWe may be unable to enter into or maintain contracts for our urgent and primary care centers on favorable terms with commercial payors.\nA significant portion of our net patient service revenue is derived from nongovernmental, third-party payors, or commercial payors, such as managed care organizations, commercial insurance providers and employer-sponsored healthcare plans. These commercial payors use a variety of methods for reimbursement depending on the arrangement involved. These arrangements include fee-for-service, PPOs and health maintenance organizations, as well as prepaid and discounted medical service packages and capitated, or fixed fee, contracts.\nFrequently, commercial payors classify or may reclassify us as either a primary care or urgent care provider. Such distinctions may result in different payment and reimbursement structures. Such differences may result in increased costs to the patient through higher co-payments, deductibles and other cost-sharing mechanisms. If, due to our classification with commercial payors or to the structure of our contracts with such payors, patients are required to pay higher amounts out of pocket than they are at our competitors, we could experience a decrease in our patient volume which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial condition.\nThere is often pressure to renegotiate reimbursement levels, including, in particular, in connection with changes to Medicare. Frequently, commercial payors reimburse us based upon contracted discounts to our established base rates. If managed care organizations and other commercial payors reduce their rates or we experience a significant shift in our revenue mix toward Medicare or Medicaid reimbursements, then our revenue and profitability would be adversely affected and our operating margins would be reduced. Commercial payors often demand discounted fee structures, and the trend toward consolidation among commercial payors tends to increase their bargaining power over fee structures. Because some commercial payors rely on all or portions of Medicare fee schedules to determine payment rates, changes to government healthcare programs that reduce payments under these schedules may negatively impact payments from commercial payors. Other healthcare providers may impact our ability to negotiate increases and other favorable terms in our reimbursement arrangements with commercial payors. For example, some of our competitors may negotiate exclusivity provisions with commercial payors or otherwise restrict the ability of commercial payors to contract with us. We may be excluded from participating in commercial payor networks, making it more expensive for certain patients to receive treatment at our centers. Our results of operations will depend, in part, on our ability to retain and renew managed care contracts as well as enter into new managed care contracts on terms favorable to us. Our inability to maintain suitable financial arrangements with commercial payors could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nAs various provisions of the ACA are implemented, commercial payors may increasingly demand fee reductions. In addition, there is a growing trend for commercial payors to take steps to shift the primary cost of care to the plan participant by increasing co-payments, co-insurance and deductibles, and these actions could discourage such patients from seeking treatment at our centers. Patient volumes could be negatively impacted if we are unable to enter into or maintain acceptable contracts with such commercial payors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nGovernment healthcare programs may reduce reimbursement rates.\nIn recent years, new legislation has been proposed and adopted at both the federal and state level that is effecting major changes in the healthcare system. Any change in the laws, regulations, or policies governing the healthcare system could adversely affect reimbursement rates and our operations and financial condition. Enacted in 2010, the ACA seeks to expand healthcare coverage, while increasing quality and limiting costs. The ACA substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and commercial payors. As a result of the ACA or the adoption of additional federal and state healthcare reforms measures there could be limits to the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare services, which could result in reduced demand for, or profitability of, our services.\nFurthermore, if due to an allegation of fraud or any other reason one or more of our physicians or other licensed healthcare providers are no longer entitled to bill and receive payment for services rendered to patients whose treatment is paid in whole or in part by a governmental payor, our revenue may be negatively impacted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf payments from commercial or governmental payors are significantly delayed, reduced or eliminated, our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe depend upon compensation from third-party payors for the services provided to patients in our centers. The amount that our centers receive in payment for services may be adversely affected by factors we do not control, including federal or state regulatory or legislative changes, cost-containment decisions and changes in reimbursement schedules of third-party payors. Any reduction or elimination of these payments could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nAdditionally, the reimbursement process is complex and can involve lengthy delays. Although we recognize revenue when healthcare services are provided, there can be delays before we receive payment. In addition, third-party payors may reject, in whole or in part, requests for reimbursement based on determinations that certain amounts are not reimbursable under plan coverage, that services provided were not medically necessary, that additional supporting documentation is necessary, or for other reasons. Retroactive adjustments by third-party payors may be difficult or cost prohibitive to appeal, and such changes could materially reduce the actual amount we receive from those payors. Delays and uncertainties in the reimbursement process may be out of our control and may adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nSignificant changes in our payor mix resulting from fluctuations in the types of patients seen at our centers could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur results may change from period to period due to fluctuations in our payor mix. Payor mix refers to the relative amounts we receive from the mix of persons or entities that pay or reimburse us for healthcare services. Because we generally receive relatively higher payment rates from commercial payors than from governmental payors or self-pay patients, a significant shift in our payor mix toward a higher percentage of self-pay or patients whose treatment is paid in whole or part by a governmental payor, which could occur for reasons beyond our control, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure to bill timely or accurately for our services could have a negative impact on our net revenues, bad debt expense and cash flow.\nBilling for our services is often complex and time consuming. The practice of providing medical services in advance of payment or prior to assessing a patient\u2019s ability to pay for such services may have a significant negative impact on our patient service revenue, bad debt expense and cash flow. We bill numerous and varied payors, including self-pay patients and various forms of commercial insurance providers. Billing requirements that must be met prior to receiving payment for services rendered often vary by payor. Self-pay patients and third-party payors may fail to pay for services even if they have been properly billed. Reimbursement is typically dependent on our providing the proper procedure and diagnosis codes.\nAdditional factors that could affect our collections for the services we render include:\n\u00b7 disputes among payors as to which party is responsible for payment;\n\u00b7 variations in coverage among various payors for similar services;\n\u00b7\nthe difficulty of adherence to specific compliance requirements, coding and various other procedures mandated by responsible parties;\n\u00b7 the institution of new coding standards; and\n\u00b7 failure to properly credential our providers to enable them to bill various payors.\nThe complexity associated with billing for our services may lead to delays in our cash collections, resulting in increased carrying costs associated with the aging of our accounts receivable as well as the increased potential for bad debt expense.\nWe are dependent on our third-party revenue cycle managers for billing and collection of our claims.\nWe submit our claims for services rendered to commercial payors and governmental payors electronically through our third-party revenue cycle managers. We are dependent on our revenue cycle managers for the timely billing and collections of our claims. Any delay by or failure of our revenue cycle managers to timely bill and collect our claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may incur costs resulting from security risks in connection with the electronic data processing by our partner banks.\nBecause we accept electronic payment cards for payments at our facilities, we may incur costs resulting from related security risks in connection with the electronic processing of confidential information by our partner banks. Recently, several large national banks have experienced potential or actual breaches in which similar data has been or may have been stolen. Such occurrences could cause patient dissatisfaction resulting in decreased visits or could also distract our management team from the management of the day-to-day operations.\nA successful challenge by tax authorities to our treatment of certain healthcare providers as independent contractors or the elimination of an existing safe harbor could materially increase our costs relating to these healthcare providers.\nCertain of our physicians and other licensed healthcare providers are engaged as independent contractors by our operating subsidiaries. Because these personnel are treated as independent contractors rather than as employees, our operating subsidiaries do not (i) withhold federal or state income taxes or other employment related taxes from their compensation, (ii) make federal or state unemployment tax or Federal Insurance Contributions Act payments with respect to them, (iii) provide workers compensation insurance with respect to them (except in states where they are required to do so for independent contractors), or (iv) allow them to participate in benefits and retirement programs available to employees. Although we have contracts with these physicians and other licensed healthcare providers obligating them to pay these taxes and other costs, if a challenge to our treatment of these physicians and other licensed healthcare providers as independent contractors by federal or state authorities were successful and they were treated as employees instead of independent contractors, we could be liable for taxes, penalties and interest. In addition, there are currently, and have been in the past, proposals made to eliminate an existing safe harbor that would potentially protect us from the imposition of taxes in these circumstances, and similar proposals could be made in the future. If such a challenge were successful or if the safe harbor were eliminated, this could cause a material increase in our costs relating to these physicians and other personnel and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCurrently, our centers are located in Georgia, Florida, Alabama, North Carolina and Virginia, making us particularly sensitive to regulatory, economic, and other conditions in those states.\nOur current centers are located in Georgia, Florida, Alabama, North Carolina and Virginia. If there were an adverse regulatory, economic or other development in any of those states, our patient volume could decline, our ability to operate our centers under our existing business model could be impacted, or there could be other unanticipated adverse impacts on our business that could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business may be adversely affected by CMS\u2019 adoption of a new coding set for diagnoses.\nCMS required all healthcare providers covered by HIPAA, including our centers, to transition to the new ICD-10 coding system beginning October 1, 2015. The ICD-10 coding system greatly expands the number and detail of billing codes used for claims compared to the existing International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, or ICD-9, coding system. Transition to the ICD-10 system may require significant and continued investment to train staff and physicians on the updated coding practices. In addition, it is possible that our centers could experience disruption or delays in reimbursement due to technical or coding errors or other implementation issues involving our systems, the systems or processes of our revenue cycle vendors, or those of our payors. Further, the ICD-10 coding system could result in decreased reimbursement if the use of ICD-10 codes results in our patients being assigned lower levels of reimbursement than were assigned under the ICD-9 coding system. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is seasonal, which impacts our results of operations.\nOur centers\u2019 patient volumes are sensitive to seasonal fluctuations in urgent care and primary care activity. Typically, winter months see a higher occurrence of influenza, bronchitis, pneumonia and similar illnesses; however, the timing and severity of these outbreaks vary dramatically. Additionally, as consumers shift toward high deductible insurance plans, they are responsible for a greater percentage of their bill, particularly in the early months of the year before other healthcare spending has occurred, which may lead to lower than expected patient volume or an increase in bad debt expense during that period. Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future depending on these and other factors.\nWe could be subject to lawsuits for which we are not fully insured.\nHealthcare providers have become subject to an increasing number of lawsuits alleging medical malpractice and related legal theories such as negligent hiring, supervision and credentialing. Some of these lawsuits involve large claim amounts and substantial defense costs. We generally procure professional liability insurance coverage for our affiliated medical professionals and professional and corporate entities. We are currently insured under policies in amounts management deems appropriate, based upon the nature and risk of our business. Nevertheless, there are exclusions and exceptions to coverage under each insurance policy that may make coverage for any claim unavailable, future claims could exceed the limits of available insurance coverage, existing insurers could become insolvent and fail to meet their obligations to provide coverage for such claims, and such coverage may not always be available with sufficient limits and at reasonable cost to insure us adequately and economically in the future. One or more successful claims against us not covered by, or exceeding the coverage of, our insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, in the normal course of our business, we may be involved in other types of lawsuits, claims, audits and investigations, including those arising out of our billing and marketing practices, employment disputes, contractual claims and other business disputes for which we may have no insurance coverage. Furthermore, for our losses that are insured or reinsured through commercial insurance providers, we are subject to the financial viability of those insurance companies. Although we believe our commercial insurance providers are currently creditworthy, they may not remain so in the future. The outcome of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Legacy Business\nWe may not be able to successfully complete the disposition of our ancillary network business to HealthSmart, or at all.\nTo focus our attention and resources on our urgent and primary care business, on October 1, 2014, we entered into a management services agreement with our largest ancillary network client, HealthSmart. Under the management services agreement, HealthSmart manages and operates our ancillary network business. The agreement also provides that at any time between October 1, 2016 and the expiration date of the management services agreement, HealthSmart may purchase, or we may require that HealthSmart purchase, our ancillary network business. Although HealthSmart\u2019s option to purchase and our option to sell the ancillary network business do not become exercisable until October 1, 2016, we are currently in negotiations with HealthSmart to facilitate a disposition of our ancillary network business. See \u201cBusiness-Ancillary Network-Management Services Agreement.\u201d\nConsummation of a disposition to HealthSmart, whether pursuant to the management services agreement or the current negotiations, would be subject to a number of conditions, including entering into a binding agreement with HealthSmart to acquire our ancillary network business. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in negotiating such an agreement on terms that will be favorable to us and our stockholders, if at all, or that the other conditions to closing will be satisfied. Accordingly, there is no assurance that HealthSmart will purchase our ancillary network business. If we do not consummate the disposition, we expect to market the business for sale to parties other than HealthSmart or expeditiously wind down the business.\nIf a disposition of our ancillary network business to HealthSmart is not completed, our ongoing business may be adversely affected and we will be subject to several risks, including the following:\n\u00b7 having to pay costs relating to the operation and eventual disposition or wind down of the ancillary network business, including approximately $2.8 million to providers as well as legal, accounting, financial advisor and other expenses attributable to such operations;\n\u00b7 focusing our management on the operation of the ancillary network business and eventual disposition or wind down, which could lead to the disruption of our ongoing business or inconsistencies in its services, standards, controls, procedures and policies, any of which could adversely affect the ability of the Company to maintain relationships with patients, regulators, vendors and employees, or could otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial results, without realizing any of the benefits of having the disposition of the ancillary network business completed; and\n\u00b7 the possible incurrence of penalties, charges or other expenses to us in connection with our management services agreement or client contract with HealthSmart that would otherwise be settled by a disposition to HealthSmart.\nAny of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as the price of our stock.\nOne client accounts for a substantial portion of our ancillary network business.\nHealthSmart is our largest client and the manager of our ancillary network business. The loss of this client or significant declines in the level of use of our services by this client, would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Although we have entered into a management services agreement with HealthSmart to manage our ancillary network business, there is no assurance that it will continue to use our ancillary network services as a customer at the same or greater level as it did in 2014. The initial term of our current payor contract with HealthSmart, which is unrelated to our management services agreement, terminates on October 1, 2017, and there is no assurance that it will be extended beyond that date.\nLarge competitors in the healthcare industry may choose to compete with us, reducing our margins. Some of these potential competitors may be our current clients.\nTraditional health insurance companies, specialty provider networks, and specialty healthcare services companies are potential competitors of our ancillary network business. These entities include well-established companies that may have greater financial, marketing and technological resources than we have. Pricing pressure caused by competition has caused many of these companies to reduce the prices charged to clients for core services and to pass on to clients a larger portion of the formulary fees and related revenues received from service providers. Increased price competition from such companies\u2019 entry into the market could reduce our margins and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In fact, our clients could choose to establish their own network of ancillary care providers. As a result, we would not only lose the benefit of revenue from such clients, but we could face additional competition in our market.\nFluctuations in the number and types of claims we process in our ancillary network business could make it more difficult to predict our net revenues in our ancillary network business from quarter to quarter.\nMonthly fluctuations in the number and types of claims we process will impact our quarterly and annual results. Our margins vary depending on the type of ancillary healthcare service provided, the rates associated with those services and the overall mix of these claims, each of which will impact our profitability. Consequently, it may be difficult to predict the net revenue from our ancillary network business from one quarter to another quarter.\nLimited barriers to entry into the ancillary healthcare services market could result in greater competition.\nThere are limited barriers to entering the market for ancillary service providers, meaning that it is relatively easy for other companies to replicate our ancillary network business model and provide the same or similar services that we currently provide. Major benefit management companies and healthcare companies not presently offering ancillary healthcare services may decide to enter the market. These companies may have greater financial, marketing and other resources than are available to us. Competition from other companies may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ancillary network business is dependent upon payments from third-party payors which may reduce rates of reimbursement.\nOur ability to achieve profitability in our ancillary network business depends, in part, on payments made by third-party payors. Competition for patients, efforts by traditional third-party payors to contain or reduce healthcare costs and the increasing influence of managed care payors, such as health maintenance organizations, have resulted in reduced rates of reimbursement in recent years. If continuing, these trends could adversely affect our results of operations and decrease profitability unless we can implement measures to offset the loss of revenues. In addition, changes in reimbursement policies of private and governmental third-party payors, including policies relating to the Medicare and Medicaid programs, could reduce the amounts reimbursed to our clients for the services provided through us, and consequently, the amount these clients would be willing to pay for our services. Also, under the medical loss ratio, or MLR, regulations included in the ACA, it is possible that a portion of the fees our existing and prospective payors are contractually required to pay us and that do not qualify as \u201cincurred claims\u201d may not be included as expenditures for activities that improve health care quality. Such a determination may make it more difficult for us to retain existing clients or add new clients, because our clients\u2019 or prospective clients\u2019 MLR may otherwise not meet the specified targets. This may reduce our net revenues and profit margins.\nWe are dependent upon our network of qualified providers, and our provider agreements may be terminated at any time.\nA network of qualified providers is an essential component of our ancillary network business. The typical form of agreement from ancillary healthcare providers provides that these agreements may be terminated at any time by either party with or without cause. If these agreements are terminated, particularly with our significant providers, such ancillary healthcare providers could enter into new agreements with our competitors which would have an adverse effect on our ability to continue our ancillary network business as it is currently conducted.\nFor any given claim, we are subject to the risk of paying more to the provider than we receive from the payor.\nOur agreements with our payors, on the one hand, and our ancillary network service providers, on the other, are negotiated separately. We have complete discretion in negotiating both the prices we charge our payors and the financial terms of our agreements with the providers. As a result, our profit is primarily a function of the spread between the prices we have agreed to pay our ancillary network service providers and the prices our payors have agreed to pay us. We bear the pricing risk because we are responsible for providing the agreed-upon services to our payors, whether or not we are able to negotiate fees and other agreement terms with our ancillary network service providers that result in a positive margin for us. There can be no assurances that these pricing arrangements will not result in losses to us.\nThe length of the current sales cycle may impede efforts to add new client accounts.\nOver the past several years, we have experienced a lengthening of the period between identification of a prospective payor client and that prospect becoming a new client. Despite efforts to strategically improve our implementation process and our new management arrangement with HealthSmart, we can give no assurances that the process of converting a sales prospect into a new client account will not be lengthy and that our revenues will not continue to decline due to the lack of new client accounts.\nWe are dependent on our manager to operate our ancillary network business.\nWe are dependent on HealthSmart to operate our ancillary network business. We have no employees in our ancillary network business and the individuals who perform services for us are employees of our manager. Our manager may terminate our management agreement at any time after October 1, 2017, or before that date with 90 days\u2019 advanced written notice, and we may not be able to find a suitable replacement in a timely manner, at a reasonable cost, or at all. We are also subject to the risk that our manager will not manage our ancillary network business in a manner that is in our best interests, particularly because HealthSmart operates its own preferred provider network that competes for clients with our ancillary network.\nAdditionally, we pay our manager cash fees for the services it provides in managing our ancillary network business. The payment of these fees may impact the amount of cash available for investment in our urgent and primary care business. We cannot assure you that, after payment of these fees, our ancillary network business will be profitable.\nIf our ancillary network business is sold to HealthSmart under the terms provided for in our management services agreement, the business may not generate net profits sufficient for us to be paid the full purchase price.\nUnder the terms of the asset purchase agreement that was negotiated with HealthSmart in conjunction with our entry into the management services agreement, if HealthSmart buys the ancillary network business it will be obligated to pay the purchase price to us only from the net profits generated by the ancillary network business after closing. Accordingly, we will be dependent on the ancillary network business, and HealthSmart\u2019s operation thereof, to generate net profits sufficient to pay the full purchase price to us. Consequently, there is no assurance that we will receive the full purchase price for the ancillary network business if it is sold to HealthSmart. See \u201cBusiness - Ancillary Network Business - Management Services Agreement.\u201d\nOur manager may be subject to conflicts of interest.\nOur manager has potential conflicts of interest in its management of our ancillary network business. Circumstances under which a conflict could arise between us and our manager include:\n\u00b7 the receipt of compensation by our manager for services for us and costs incurred, which may cause our manager to engage in transactions or incur costs that generate higher fees, rather than transactions that are more appropriate or beneficial to our business;\n\u00b7 taking actions that are beneficial to our manager\u2019s preferred provider network that are detrimental to our ancillary network business;\n\u00b7 taking actions that benefit our manager in its capacity as our client which are not beneficial to our ancillary network business; and\n\u00b7 some of our clients are competitors of our manager, and our manager may take actions that are not in the best interests of those clients.\nWe are also subject to the risk that our manager will not manage our ancillary network business in a manner that is in our best interests, particularly because HealthSmart operates its own preferred provider network that competes for clients with our ancillary network.\nRisks Related to Our Regulatory Environment\nThe healthcare industry is heavily regulated, and if we fail to comply with these laws and government regulations we could incur penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations.\nThe healthcare industry is heavily regulated and closely scrutinized by federal, state and local governments. Comprehensive statutes and regulations govern the manner in which we provide and bill for services, our contractual relationships with our physicians, vendors, patients and clients, our marketing activities and other aspects of our operations. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could be exposed to civil and criminal penalties such as fines, damages, overpayment recoupment, loss of enrollment status and exclusion from government healthcare programs. Any action against us for violation of these laws or regulations, even if successfully defended, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. Our physicians and other licensed healthcare providers are also subject to ethical guidelines and operating standards of professional and private accreditation agencies.\nThe laws, regulations and standards governing the provision of healthcare services may change significantly in the future, and these changes may materially and adversely affect our business. Furthermore, a review of our business by regulatory or accreditation authorities could result in determinations that could adversely affect our operations.\nOur urgent and primary care centers are and will be subject to numerous statutes and regulations in the states in which we operate now or in the future and the failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal sanctions.\nThe operation of urgent and primary care centers subjects us, and will subject us, to many state laws and regulations. In general, states, whether directly or through boards, agencies or other delegated authorities, regulate the ownership and dispensing of controlled substances, the retention and storage of medical records, the ownership and management of entities engaged in healthcare services, patient privacy and protection of health information, the licensure of healthcare providers, and the clinical supervision by physicians of nurse practitioners and physicians assistants, training, client monitoring and supervision of staff, among other aspects of our operations. All such laws and regulations, and the applicable interpretations of such laws and regulations, are subject to change.\nAdditional regulation of centers such as ours has been proposed in several states. The adoption of any such regulations in the states in which we operate now or in the future could force us to change our operational or transactional approach or lead to a finding by regulators that we do not meet legal requirements. We may be subject to criminal prosecution, regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions if our operations or centers are found to not comply with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, we may be required to refund all funds received from patients and third-party payors during the period of noncompliance.\nAlthough we monitor compliance concerns on a corporate level and at each center, and seek to institute best practices on compliance matters, we do not have a dedicated chief compliance officer whose sole job is to monitor and manage compliance matters. Consequently, we may not immediately identify practices that need to be changed or remediated. Further, as we integrate acquired centers, we seek to ensure they comply with the relevant regulations, but we cannot assure you that compliance or regulatory issues will not arise.\nFailure to comply with laws and regulations governing us and the centers we manage could result in civil or criminal sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nState regulation of the expansion of urgent and primary care centers could prevent us from reaching our expansion objectives.\nMany states have certificate of need programs that require some level of prior approval for the development, acquisition or expansion of certain healthcare facilities. Although the states where our current centers operate do not require that we obtain a certificate of need to acquire or operate our centers, in the event we choose to acquire or open centers in a state that does require such approval, we may be required to obtain a certificate of need before the acquisition or opening occurs. If we are unable to obtain such approvals, we may not be able to move forward with the planned activity.\nOnly a few states, including Florida, currently require the licensure of centers such as ours. The lack of a specific licensure process for our centers in the vast majority of states may lead state legislators or regulators to regulate aggressively the growth of our industry, potentially seeking to treat our industry in a manner similar to hospitals or freestanding emergency departments. Further, the growing number of urgent care centers and freestanding emergency departments may lead to legislation or regulations requiring us to change substantially our operations or cease our operations in that state entirely. Any such requirements could have a material adverse effect on our prospects and growth strategy.\nOur urgent and primary care centers are subject to comprehensive laws and regulations that govern the manner in which we bill and are paid for our services by third-party payors, and the failure to comply with these requirements can result in civil or criminal sanctions, including exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs.\nA substantial portion of our urgent and primary care services are paid for by commercial payors and governmental payors. These third-party payors typically have differing and complex billing and documentation requirements. If we fail to meet these requirements, we may not be paid for our services or payment may be substantially delayed or reduced.\nNumerous state and federal laws also apply to our claims for payment, including but not limited to (i) \u201ccoordination of benefits\u201d rules that dictate which payor must be billed first when a patient has coverage from multiple payors, (ii) requirements that overpayments be refunded within a specified period of time, (iii) \u201creassignment\u201d rules governing the ability to bill and collect professional fees on behalf of other providers, (iv) requirements that electronic claims for payment be submitted using certain standardized transaction codes and formats, and (v) laws requiring all health and financial information of patients be handled in a manner that complies with applicable security and privacy standards.\nThird-party payors carefully monitor compliance with these and other applicable rules. Our failure to comply with these rules could result in our obligation to refund amounts previously paid for such services or non-payment for our services.\nIf we are found to have violated any of these or any of the other laws or regulations which govern our activities, the resulting penalties, damages, fines or other sanctions could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.\nChanges in coverage and the rates or methods of third-party reimbursements may adversely affect our urgent and primary care revenue and operations.\nA substantial portion of our urgent and primary care revenue is derived from direct billings to patients and third-party payors. As a result, any changes in the rates or methods of reimbursement for the services we provide could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and financial results. Reimbursement rates can vary depending on whether our center is an in-network or out-of-network provider. Our centers may be out-of-network for some patients. When acting as an out-of-network provider, reimbursement rates may be lower, co-payments and deductibles may be higher and we may have difficulties complying with the billing requirements of certain third-party payors. Additionally, the continued implementation of the ACA could result in substantial changes in coverage and reimbursement, including changes in coverage and amounts paid by private payors, which could have an adverse impact on our revenue from those sources.\nPast and future healthcare reform legislation and other changes in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe healthcare industry is subject to changing political, regulatory and other influences. In March 2010, the President signed the ACA into law, which made major changes in how healthcare is delivered and reimbursed and increased access to health insurance benefits for the uninsured and underinsured population of the United States.\nBecause of the continued uncertainty about the implementation of various provisions of the ACA, we cannot predict with any certainty the impact of the ACA on our business models, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Also, Congress and state legislatures may continue reviewing and assessing alternative healthcare delivery and payment systems and may in the future adopt legislation making additional fundamental changes in the healthcare system. There is no assurance that such changes will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Continued efforts to shift healthcare costs to the patient (through co-payments, deductibles, and other mechanisms) could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are required to restructure our arrangements with physicians because of current or future laws, we may incur additional costs, lose contracts or suffer a reduction in net revenue.\nVarious laws bear on our relationships with the physicians staffing our urgent and primary care centers. Authorities in some states could find that our contractual relationships with our physicians violate laws prohibiting the corporate practice of medicine and fee-splitting. These laws are generally intended to prevent unlicensed persons or entities from interfering with or inappropriately influencing the physician\u2019s professional judgment, but they may also prevent the sharing of professional services income with non-professional or business interests. Approximately 30 states have some form of corporate practice of medicine restrictions, and, as we continue to expand into new markets, our current business model may implicate these restrictions. Two of the states in which we currently operate, Georgia, and North Carolina, have adopted certain corporate practice of medicine restrictions against non-professional entities. Although we believe we are currently in material compliance with applicable law, including with respect to the corporate practice of medicine and fee-splitting, regulatory authorities or other parties, including our employed and contracted physicians, or our physicians, may assert that, among other things, our state-level operating subsidiaries are impermissibly engaged in the practice of medicine. In that event, we could be subject to adverse judicial or administrative interpretations, to civil or criminal penalties, our contracts could be found legally invalid and unenforceable or we could be required to modify our organizational structure, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to execute our growth strategy. Moreover, if we are required to modify our structure and organization to comply with these laws and rules, our financing agreements may prohibit such modifications and require us to obtain the consent of the holders of our debt or require the refinancing of such debt.\nWe are subject to the data privacy, security and breach notification requirements of HIPAA, HITECH and other data privacy and security laws, and the failure to comply with these rules, or allegations that we have failed to do so, could result in civil or criminal sanctions.\nNumerous federal and state laws and regulations, including HIPAA and HITECH, govern the collection, dissemination, security, use and confidentiality of patient-identifiable health information. As required by HIPAA, HHS has adopted standards to protect the privacy and security of this health-related information. The HIPAA privacy regulations contain detailed requirements concerning the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information and the grant of certain rights to patients with respect to the use and disclosure of such information by \u201ccovered entities.\u201d The Company and each of our centers are considered covered entities under HIPAA. We have taken actions to comply with the HIPAA privacy regulations including the creation and implementation of policies and procedures, staff training, execution of HIPAA-compliant contractual arrangements with certain service providers and various other measures. Although we believe we are in substantial compliance, ongoing implementation and oversight of these measures involves significant time, effort and expense.\nIn addition to the privacy requirements, HIPAA-covered entities must implement certain administrative, physical, and technical security standards to protect the integrity, confidentiality and availability of certain electronic health-related information received, maintained, or transmitted by covered entities or their business associates. Although we have taken actions in an effort to be in compliance with these security regulations, a security incident that bypasses our information security systems causing an information security breach, loss of protected health information, or PHI, or other data subject to privacy laws or a material disruption of our operational systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, along with fines. Furthermore, ongoing implementation and oversight of these security measures involves significant time, effort and expense.\nFurther, HITECH, as implemented in part by an omnibus final rule published in the Federal Register on January 25, 2013, further requires that patients be notified of any unauthorized acquisition, access, use, or disclosure of their unsecured PHI that compromises the privacy or security of such information. HHS has established the presumption that all unauthorized uses or disclosures of unsecured PHI constitute breaches unless the covered entity or business associate establishes that there is a low probability the information has been compromised. HITECH and implementing regulations specify that such notifications must be made without unreasonable delay and in no case later than 60 calendar days after discovery of the breach. Breaches affecting 500 patients or more must be reported immediately to HHS, which will post the name of the breaching entity on its public website. Furthermore, breaches affecting 500 patients or more in the same state or jurisdiction must also be reported to the local media. If a breach involves fewer than 500 people, the covered entity must record it in a log and notify HHS of such breaches at least annually. These breach notification requirements apply not only to unauthorized disclosures of unsecured PHI to outside third parties but also to unauthorized internal access to or use of such PHI.\nThe scope of the privacy and security requirements under HIPAA was substantially expanded by HITECH, which also increased penalties for violations. Currently, violations of the HIPAA privacy, security and breach notification standards may result in civil penalties ranging from $100 to $50,000 per violation, subject to a cap of $1.5 million in the aggregate for violations of the same standard in a single calendar year. The amount of penalty that may be assessed depends, in part, upon the culpability of the applicable covered entity or business associate in committing the violation. Some penalties for certain violations that were not due to \u201cwillful neglect\u201d may be waived by the Secretary of HHS, in whole or in part, to the extent that the payment of the penalty would be excessive relative to the violation. HITECH also authorized state attorneys general to file suit on behalf of residents of their states. Applicable courts may be able to award damages, costs and attorneys\u2019 fees related to violations of HIPAA in such cases. HITECH also mandates that the Secretary of HHS conduct periodic compliance audits of a cross-section of HIPAA-covered entities and business associates. Every covered entity and business associate is subject to being audited, regardless of the entity\u2019s compliance record.\nState laws may impose more protective privacy restrictions related to health information and may afford individuals a private right of action with respect to the violation of such laws. Both state and federal laws are subject to modification or enhancement of privacy protection at any time. We are subject to any federal or state privacy-related laws that are more restrictive than the privacy regulations issued under HIPAA. These statutes vary and could impose additional requirements on us and more severe penalties for disclosures of health information. If we fail to comply with HIPAA, similar state laws or any new laws, including laws addressing data confidentiality, security or breach notification, we could incur substantial monetary penalties and substantial damage to our reputation.\nStates may also impose restrictions related to the confidentiality of personal information that is not considered PHI under HIPAA, including certain identifying information and financial information of our patients. Theses state laws may impose additional notification requirements in the event of a breach of such personal information. Failure to comply with such data confidentiality, security and breach notification laws may result in substantial monetary penalties.\nHIPAA and HITECH also include standards for common healthcare electronic transactions and code sets, such as claims information, plan eligibility and payment information. Covered entities such as the Company and each of our centers are required to conform to such transaction set standards.\nOur centers participate in the federal Medicare program and, as a result, we must comply with a number of additional federal regulatory requirements.\nOur centers participate as providers the federal Medicare program. As participants in the Medicare program, we are directly subject to certain federal regulatory requirements, including the Stark Law and the Anti-Kickback Statute. Furthermore, the Medicare program is particularly susceptible to statutory and regulatory changes, retroactive and prospective rate adjustments, spending freezes, federal and state funding reductions and administrative rulings and interpretations concerning, without limitation, patient eligibility requirements, funding levels and the method of calculating payments or reimbursements.\nSince 1992, Medicare has paid for the \u201cmedically necessary\u201d services of physicians, non-physician practitioners, and certain other suppliers under a physician fee schedule, a system that pays for covered physicians\u2019 services furnished to a person with Medicare Part B coverage. Under the physician fee schedule, relative values are assigned to each of more than 7,000 services to reflect the amount of work, the direct and indirect (overhead) practice expenses, and the malpractice expenses typically involved in furnishing that service. Each of these three relative value components is multiplied by a geographic adjustment factor to adjust the payment for variations in the costs of furnishing services in different localities. The RVUs are summed for each service and then are multiplied by a fixed-dollar conversion factor to establish the payment amount for each service. The higher the number of RVUs assigned to a service, the higher the payment. Under the Medicare fee-for-service payment system, an individual can choose any licensed physician enrolled in Medicare and use the services of any healthcare provider or facility certified by Medicare.\nHistorically, CMS was required to limit the growth in spending under the physician fee schedule by a predetermined sustained growth rate, or SGR. Congress typically responded to these automatic physician payment cuts with a series of temporary fixes. On April 16, 2015, however, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, or MACRA, was enacted which includes permanent repeal of the SGR formula. With MACRA, the long sought after goal of permanently repealing the SGR was achieved and overrides a 21.2% across-the-board cut in Medicare physician payments that briefly took effect on April 1, 2015. Under MACRA, physician payment updates are to be linked to quality and value measurement and participation in alternative payment models. Enactment of MACRA and repeal of the SGR could be offset by further reductions in Medicare payments, and any such reductions could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFurthermore, the ACA reduces annual payment updates for certain providers and reduces Medicare payments for certain procedures, and the Budget Control Act of 2011, or BCA, requires automatic spending reductions for each fiscal year through 2021. As a result of the BCA and subsequent activity in Congress, a $1.2 trillion sequester (across-the-board spending cuts) in discretionary programs took effect in 2013. In particular, a 2% reduction in Medicare payments took effect on April 1, 2013 and has recently been extended for an additional two years beyond the original expiration date of 2021.\nWe are subject to CMS\u2019 RAC program.\nThe Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, or MMA, introduced on a trial basis the use of RACs for the purpose of identifying and recouping Medicare overpayments and underpayments. Any overpayment received from Medicare is considered a debt owed to the federal government. In October 2008, CMS made the RAC program permanent. RACs review Medicare claims to determine whether such claims were appropriately reimbursed by Medicare. RACs engage in an automated review and in a complex review of claims. Automated reviews are conducted when a review of the medical record is not required and there is certainty that the service is not covered or is coded incorrectly. Complex reviews involve the review of all underlying medical records supporting the claim, and are generally conducted where there is a high likelihood, but not certainty, that an overpayment has occurred. RACs are paid a contingency fee based on overpayments identified and collected.\nA Medicare administrative contractor, or MAC, may suspend Medicare payments to a provider if it determines that an overpayment has occurred. When a Medicare claim for payment is filed, the MAC will notify the patient and the provider of its initial determination regarding reimbursement. The MAC may deny the claim for one of several reasons, including the lack of necessary information or lack of medical necessity for the services rendered. Providers may appeal any denials for claim payments.\nAny such reviews under the RAC program or denials by the MAC could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are subject to the Anti-Kickback Statute, Stark Law, FCA, Civil Monetary Penalties statute and analogous provisions of applicable state laws and could face substantial penalties if we fail to comply with such laws.\nAnti-Kickback Statute\nThe Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of remuneration, directly or indirectly, in return for the referral of patients or arranging for the referral of patients, or in return for the recommendation, arrangement, purchase, lease or order of items or services that are covered, in whole or in part, by a federal healthcare program such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term \u201cremuneration\u201d has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value such as gifts, discounts, rebates, waiver of payments or providing anything at less than its fair market value. The ACA amended the intent requirement of the Anti-Kickback Statute such that a person or entity can be found guilty of violating the statute without actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violation the statute. Further, the ACA now provides that claims submitted in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitute false or fraudulent claims for purposes of the FCA, including the failure to timely return an overpayment. Many states have adopted similar prohibitions against kickbacks and other practices that are intended to influence the purchase, lease or ordering of healthcare items and services reimbursed by a governmental health program or state Medicaid program. Some of these state prohibitions apply to remuneration for referrals of healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial payors.\nBecause we currently accept funds from governmental healthcare programs, we are subject to the Anti-Kickback Statute. Violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute can result in exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs as well as civil and criminal penalties, such as $25,000 per violation and up to three times the remuneration involved. If in violation, we may be required to enter into settlement agreements with the government to avoid such sanctions. Typically, such settlement agreements require substantial payments to the government in exchange for the government to release its claims and may also require entry into a corporate integrity agreement, or CIA. Any such sanctions or obligations contained in a CIA could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nStark Law\nThe Stark Law prohibits a physician from referring a patient to a healthcare provider for certain \u201cdesignated health services\u201d reimbursable by Medicare if the physician (or close family members) has a financial relationship with that provider, including an ownership or investment interest, a loan or debt relationship or a compensation relationship. The designated health services covered by the law include, among others, laboratory and imaging services and the provision of durable medical equipment. Some states have self-referral laws similar to the Stark Law for Medicaid claims and commercial claims.\nWe have entered into several types of financial relationships with physicians who staff our urgent and primary care centers, including compensation arrangements. We believe that the compensation arrangements under our employment agreements and independent contractor agreements satisfy one or more exceptions to the Stark Law. Although we believe that the compensation provisions included in our written physician agreements, which are the result of arm\u2019s length negotiations, result in fair market value payments for medical services rendered or to be rendered, an enforcement agency could nevertheless challenge the level of compensation that we pay our physicians.\nThe ownership of our stock by any of our physicians will constitute a \u201cfinancial relationship\u201d for purposes of the Stark Law. As a result, in order to bill Medicare for the designated health services referred by such physician stockholder, we must qualify for one or more exceptions to the Stark Law. Although an exception exists for publicly traded securities, we will not qualify until our stockholders\u2019 equity exceeds $75.0 million at the end of our most recent fiscal year or on average during the previous three years. If we are unable to qualify for another exception to the Stark Law, we will not be entitled to bill Medicare for services rendered by a physician stockholder. As a result, we may suffer losses to our net revenue. Further, it may become necessary for us to perform regular compliance tests to determine which, if any, of our physicians own our stock, and, if so, to determine whether or not we meet an applicable exception to the Stark Law. Such efforts could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to compensate physicians, and could result in damage to our reputation.\nViolation of the Stark Law may result in prohibition of payment for services rendered, a refund of any Medicare payments for services that resulted from an unlawful referral, $15,000 civil monetary penalties for specified infractions, criminal penalties, and potential exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, and potential false claims liability. The repayment provisions in the Stark Law are not dependent on the parties having an improper intent; rather, the Stark Law is a strict liability statute and any violation is subject to repayment of all amounts arising out of tainted referrals. If physician self-referral laws are interpreted differently or if other legislative restrictions are issued, we could incur significant sanctions and loss of revenues, or we could have to change our arrangements and operations in a way that could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, damage to our reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nFalse Claims Act\nThe federal civil FCA prohibits providers from, among other things, (i) knowingly presenting or causing to be presented, claims for payments from the Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs that are false or fraudulent; (ii) knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement to get a false or fraudulent claim paid or approved by the federal government; or (iii) knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. The \u201cqui tam\u201d or \u201cwhistleblower\u201d provisions of the FCA allow private individuals to bring actions under the FCA on behalf of the government. These private parties are entitled to share in any amounts recovered by the government, and, as a result, the number of \u201cwhistleblower\u201d lawsuits that have been filed against providers has increased significantly in recent years. Defendants found to be liable under the FCA may be required to pay three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties ranging between $5,500 and $11,000 for each separate false claim as well as possible expulsion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.\nThere are many potential bases for liability under the FCA. The government has used the FCA to prosecute Medicare and other government healthcare program fraud such as coding errors, billing for services not provided, and providing care that is not medically necessary or that is substandard in quality. The ACA also provides that claims submitted in connection with patient referrals that results from violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitute false claims for the purpose of the FCA, and some courts have held that a violation of the Stark law can result in FCA liability as well. In addition, a number of states have adopted their own false claims and whistleblower provisions whereby a private party may file a civil lawsuit in state court. We are required to provide information to our employees and certain contractors about state and federal false claims laws and whistleblower provisions and protections.\nCivil Monetary Penalties Statute\nThe federal Civil Monetary Penalties statute prohibits, among other things, the offering or giving of remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person or entity knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary\u2019s selection of a particular provider or supplier of items or services reimbursable by a federal or state healthcare program.\nThe scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to constant change. Federal and state enforcement entities have significantly increased their scrutiny of healthcare companies and providers which has led to investigations, prosecutions, convictions and large settlements. Although we intend to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable federal and state fraud and abuse laws, many of these laws are broadly worded and may be interpreted or applied in ways that cannot be predicted with any certainty. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our arrangements or business practices will not be subject to government scrutiny or will be found to be in compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws. Further, responding to investigations can be time consuming and result in significant legal fees and can potentially divert management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business.\nThe Office of Inspector General, or OIG, is authorized to seek different amounts of civil monetary penalties and assessments based on the type of violation at issue. For example, in a case of false or fraudulent claims, the OIG may seek a penalty of up to $10,000 for each item or service improperly claimed, and an assessment of up to three times the amount improperly claimed. In a kickback case, the OIG may seek a penalty of up to $50,000 for each improper act and damages of up to three times the amount of remuneration at issue (regardless of whether some of the remuneration was for a lawful purpose).\nIf we fail to effectively and timely implement electronic health record systems, our operations could be adversely affected.\nAs required by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the Secretary of HHS has developed and implemented an incentive payment program for eligible healthcare professionals that adopt and meaningfully use EHR technology. HHS uses PECOS to verify Medicare enrollment prior to making EHR incentive program payments. If our professionals are unable to meet the requirements for participation in the incentive payment program, including having an enrollment record in PECOS, we will not be eligible to receive incentive payments that could offset some of the costs of implementing EHR systems. Further, healthcare professionals that fail to demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology are subject to reduced payments from Medicare. System conversions to comply with EHR could be time consuming and disruptive for physicians and employees. Failure to implement EHR systems effectively and in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe are in process of converting certain of our clinical and patient accounting information system applications to newer versions of existing applications or altogether new applications. In connection with our implementation and conversions, we have incurred capitalized costs and additional training and implementation expenses.\nIf we fail to comply with laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment and human health and safety, we could incur substantial penalties and fines.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety, including those governing the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the cleanup of contaminated sites and the maintenance of a safe workplace. Some of our operations include the use, generations and disposal of hazardous materials. We also plan to acquire ownership in new facilities and properties, some of which may have had a history of commercial or other operations. We may, in the future, incur liability under environmental statutes and regulations with respect to contamination of sites we own or operate, including contamination caused by prior owners or operators of such sites, abutters or other persons, and the off-site disposal of hazardous substances. Violations of these laws and regulations may result in substantial civil penalties or fines.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Securities\nInvestors may experience dilution of their ownership interests because of the future issuance of additional shares of our common stock.\nFrom time to time, we may issue shares of our common stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for common stock in the future in connection with hiring or retaining employees, future acquisitions, future sales of our securities for capital raising purposes, or for other business purposes, resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of our stockholders at that time. At December 31, 2015, we had outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of 962,400 shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $2.92 per share, warrants to purchase an aggregate of 13,167,397 shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $0.85 per share (assumes adjustment of exercise price for warrants to purchase 249,990 shares is approved by stockholders) and 1,575,320 shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under our 2005 Stock Option Plan and our Amended and Restated 2009 Plan.\nOn August 12, 2015, we issued warrants to purchase 300,000 shares of our common stock in connection with the guarantee of our indebtedness at an initial exercise price of $1.70 per share. The exercise prices of the warrants to purchase 800,000 shares of our common stock that were issued on July 30, 2014 at an initial exercise price of $3.15 per share and to purchase 960,000 shares of our common stock that were issued on December 4, 2014 at an initial exercise price of $2.71 per share and the warrant to purchase 50,010 shares issued on August 12, 2015 to an individual who is not an officer or director of the Company have been adjusted downward to $1.46 per share to reflect the closing price of our common stock on August 28, 2015, the date restricted stock was awarded to our directors pursuant to our director compensation plan. The adjustment resulted from our issuing such restricted stock at a price per share less than the exercise price of such warrants. Holders of warrants representing substantially all of the shares issuable under the July 2014 warrants have waived any adjustment in the number of shares that could be purchased pursuant to their warrants as a result of the change in the exercise price. The adjusted exercise price of the December 4, 2014 warrants and the warrant for 50,010 shares issued on August 12, 2015 have been further adjusted to $0.70, the public offering price of the Class A Units in our December 2015 offering. If our stockholders approve certain anti-dilution provisions of the August 12, 2015 warrants to purchase 249,990 shares issued to Mr. Pappajohn and Mr. Oman, the exercise price of those warrants will also be adjusted to $0.70 per share, the public offering price of the Class A Units in our December 2015 offering. We intend to seek such stockholder approval at our 2016 annual meeting of stockholders. The exercise of such outstanding awards and warrants, the issuance of future awards under our 2005 Stock Option Plan and Amended and Restated 2009 Plan, the exercise of Warrants or conversion of Series A Preferred sold in our December 2015 offering, or the future issuance of any such additional shares of common stock, will result in further dilution of your investment and may create downward pressure on the trading price of the common stock. There can also be no assurance that we will not be required to issue additional shares, warrants or other convertible securities in the future in conjunction with any capital raising efforts, including at a price (or exercise prices) below the price at which shares of our common stock are currently traded on The NASDAQ Capital Market, and new investors could gain rights superior to those of our stockholders at that time.\nOur executive officers, directors and principal stockholders have significant voting power.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our executive officers, directors and holders of more than 5% of our outstanding common stock together beneficially owned approximately 87% of our common stock (including shares underlying currently exercisable warrants and options). As a result, if these stockholders were to choose to act together, they would be able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, as well as our management and affairs. For example, these persons, if they choose to act together, would be able to control the election of directors and approval of any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentration of ownership control may:\n\u00b7 delay, defer or prevent a change in control;\n\u00b7 entrench our management and Board of Directors; or\n\u00b7 impede a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us that other stockholders may desire.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile and this may adversely affect our stockholders.\nThe price at which our common stock trades may be volatile. The stock market can experience significant price and volume fluctuations that have affect the market prices of securities, including securities of healthcare companies. The market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u00b7 our operating and financial performance;\n\u00b7 variances in our quarterly financial results compared to expectations;\n\u00b7 the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock;\n\u00b7 future sales of common stock or the perception that sales could occur;\n\u00b7 investor perception of our business and our prospects;\n\u00b7 factors affecting our industry and competitors;\n\u00b7 developments relating to litigation or governmental investigations;\n\u00b7 changes or proposed changes in healthcare laws or regulations or enforcement of these laws and regulations, or announcements relating to these matters;\n\u00b7 general economic and stock market conditions; and\n\u00b7 other risk factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nIn addition, the stock market in general has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of healthcare companies. These broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our financial condition, results from operations, business or prospects. In the past, securities class-action litigation has often been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their respective securities. We may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Litigation of this type is often expensive to defend and may divert our management team\u2019s attention as well as resources from the operation of our business. There is no assurance that the market price of our common stock will not fall in the future.\nWe do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend solely on any appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe do not pay dividends on our shares of common stock and currently intend to retain all future earnings to finance the continued growth and development of our business. In addition, we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future and our credit agreements limit our ability to pay dividends. Any future payment of cash dividends will depend upon our financial condition, capital requirements, earnings and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. As a result, capital appreciation in the price of our common stock, if any, will be your only source of gain on an investment in our common stock. See \u201cMarket for Registrant\u2019s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities - Dividend Policy.\u201d\nOur common stock may be delisted from The NASDAQ Capital Market, which may make it more difficult for you to sell your shares.\nOur common stock is listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market, and we are therefore subject to its continued listing requirements, including requirements with respect to the market value of publicly-held shares, minimum bid price per share, and minimum stockholder's equity, among others, and requirements relating to board and committee independence. If we fail to satisfy one or more of the requirements, we may be delisted from The NASDAQ Capital Market.\nOn May 21, 2015, we received a letter from NASDAQ indicating that as of March 31, 2015, our reported stockholders\u2019 equity of $407,000 did not meet the $2.5 million minimum required to maintain continued listing, as set forth in NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(b)(1). The letter further stated that as of May 20, 2015 we did not meet either of the alternatives of market value of listed securities or net income from continuing operations.\nUnder NASDAQ rules, we submitted a plan to NASDAQ to regain compliance, which NASDAQ accepted, granting us until November 17, 2015 to evidence compliance. However, because we were unable to raise equity capital as we anticipated, we did not evidence compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) by November 17, 2015. On November 18, 2015, we received a letter from NASDAQ stating that we had not regained compliance with the continued listing requirements of The NASDAQ Capital Market. As a result, NASDAQ determined that our common stock would be delisted from The NASDAQ Capital Market effective November 30, 2015. We appealed that determination which stayed the delisting of our common stock until the appeal was heard on January 14, 2016 by the NASDAQ Hearings Panel. Following the hearing, the NASDAQ Hearings Panel continued our listing through May 16, 2016 in order to allow us to meet the $2.5 million minimum stockholders\u2019 equity requirement for continued listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market.\nOn January 8, 2016, we received a deficiency letter from NASDAQ indicating that as of January 8, 2016, our common stock failed to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive days in violation of NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). The notification had no immediate effect on the listing of our common stock on The NASDAQ Capital Market and our common stock is continuing to trade on The NASDAQ Capital Market. Under NASDAQ rules, we were granted a 180-day period within which to regain compliance. If at any time during this compliance period, the closing bid price of our listed securities is at least $1.00 per share for at least ten consecutive business days, NASDAQ will provide us with written confirmation of compliance and the matter will be closed. If we have not regained compliance within the 180-day period, we may be eligible for an additional 180 days to regain compliance if certain additional requirements are met, including our providing written notice to NASDAQ of our intention to cure the deficiency by effecting a reverse stock split.\nWe cannot assure you that NASDAQ will deem us to be in compliance with either of these listing standards and continue the listing of our common stock on The NASDAQ Capital Market. Moreover, our losses are continuing and, even if NASDAQ permits listing of our common stock to continue, we may not be able to continue to satisfy this listing standard in the future. Accordingly, we will likely need to raise additional equity financing to satisfy the NASDAQ minimum stockholders\u2019 equity requirement for continued listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market in the future.\nDelisting from The NASDAQ Capital Market may adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing through the public or private sale of equity securities, may significantly affect the ability of investors to trade our securities and may negatively affect the value and liquidity of our common stock. Delisting also could have other negative results, including the potential loss of employee confidence, the loss of institutional investor interest business development opportunities.\nIf we are delisted from The NASDAQ Capital Market and we are not able to list our common stock on another exchange, our common stock could be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board or in the \u201cpink sheets.\u201d As a result, we could face significant adverse consequences including, among others:\n\u00b7 a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u00b7 a determination that our common stock is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d which will require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities;\n\u00b7 a limited amount of news and little or no analyst coverage for us; and\n\u00b7 a decreased ability to issue additional securities (including pursuant to short-form registration statements on Form S-3) or obtain additional financing in the future.\nIf our common stock becomes subject to the penny stock rules, it would become more difficult to trade our shares.\nThe SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than $5.00, other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or authorized for quotation on certain automated quotation systems, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system. If we do not retain a listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market and if the price of our common stock is less than $5.00, our common stock will be deemed a penny stock. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, before a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document containing specified information. In addition, the penny stock rules require that before effecting any transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, a broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive (i) the purchaser\u2019s written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement; (ii) a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks; and (iii) a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our common stock, and therefore stockholders may have difficulty selling their shares.\nThe market price of our common stock in the future may be affected by different factors than in the past.\nWith our entry into the urgent and primary care line of business and our plans to exit the ancillary network business, the market price of our common stock in the future may be impacted by different factors than those that have affected the market price of our common stock in the past.\nAnti-takeover provisions of our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove the current members of our board and management.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change of control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares. Furthermore, these provisions could prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove members of our Board of Directors. These provisions also could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. Stockholders who wish to participate in these transactions may not have the opportunity to do so. These provisions, among other things:\n\u00b7 authorize our Board of Directors to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock, the rights of which will be determined at the discretion of the Board of Directors and that, if issued, could operate as a \u201cpoison pill\u201d to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer to prevent an acquisition that our Board of Directors does not approve; and\n\u00b7 limit who may call a stockholders meeting.\nIn addition, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or the DGCL, which may, unless certain criteria are met, prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of the voting rights on our common stock, from merging or combining with us for a prescribed period of time.\nWe may not have an active market for our common stock and, as a result, it may be difficult for you to sell your shares of our common stock.\nDespite our current listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market, there may not be a meaningful, consistent, trading market for our common stock. Generally, trading in our common stock has been limited. An inactive market may impair our ability to raise capital by selling shares of our common stock and may impair our ability to enter into strategic partnerships or acquire companies or products by using our shares of common stock as consideration. We cannot predict with any certainty the prices at which our common stock will trade. It is possible that in one or more future periods our results of operations may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors and, as a result of these and other factors, the price of our common stock may fall. If we do not have an active market for our common stock, it may be difficult for investors to sell their shares without depressing the market prices for the shares or at all.", "PERMNO": 91515, "SIC": 8011, "TIC": "GNOW"}
