RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the exhibits hereto, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business. Our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. This section contains forward-looking statements. You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements at the end of Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe recently completed a global strategic review of our business. If our new strategic direction does not yield the expected results or we fail to implement the necessary changes to our operations, we could see material adverse effects on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn fiscal 2017, we organized our products into four categories for purposes of evaluating and developing their growth potential: Plasma, Hemostasis Management, Blood Center and Cell Processing. We believe that Plasma and Hemostasis Management have the greatest growth potential, while Cell Processing innovation offers an opportunity to increase market share and expand into new segments. We believe Blood Center competes in challenging markets which require us to manage the business differently, including reducing costs, shrinking the scope of the current product line, and evaluating opportunities to exit unfavorable customer contracts.\nIf we have not correctly identified the product categories with greatest growth potential, we will not allocate our resources appropriately which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Further, if we are unable to reduce costs and complexity in our Blood Center business unit, we will obtain lower than expected cash flows to fund our future growth and capital needs. This could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to successfully expand our product lines through internal research and development and acquisitions, our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nThe risks of missteps and set backs are an inherent part of the innovation and development processes in the medical device industry.\nContinued growth of our business depends on our maintaining a pipeline of profitable new products and successful improvements to our existing products. This requires accurate market analysis and carefully targeted application of intellectual and financial resources toward the development or acquisition of new products. The creation and adoption of technological advances is only one step. We must also efficiently develop the technology into a product which confers a competitive advantage, represents a cost effective solution or provides improved patient care. Finally, as a part of the regulatory process of obtaining marketing clearance for new products, we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials, the results of which may be unfavorable, or perceived as unfavorable by the market, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nLoss of a significant customer could adversely affect our business.\nIn fiscal 2017, one plasma collection customer accounted for approximately 14% of our net revenues and our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 42% of our net revenues. If any of our largest customers materially reduce their purchases from us or terminate their relationship with us for any reason, we could experience an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur four largest Plasma customers have contracts in place which will expire before the end of fiscal 2019. As a result, we will need to amend current contracts or enter into new contracts for the PCS\u00ae 300. A failure to enter into new contracts with these customers on acceptable terms, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur inability to obtain, or any delay in obtaining, any necessary U.S. or foreign regulatory clearances or approvals for our newly developed products or product enhancements could harm our business and prospects.\nOur products are subject to a high level of regulatory oversight. Our inability to obtain, or any delay in obtaining, any necessary U.S. or foreign regulatory clearances or approvals for newly developed products or product enhancements could harm our business and prospects. The process of obtaining clearances and approvals can be costly and time consuming. In addition, there is a risk that any approvals or clearances, once obtained, may be withdrawn or modified.\nMost medical devices cannot be marketed in the U.S. without 510(k) clearance or premarket approval by the FDA. We have recently submitted a new plasmapheresis device, the PCS\u00ae 300, for 510(k) regulatory clearance with the FDA and continue to work on future enhancements to this important product, some of which may require additional regulatory clearances.\nDelays in receipt of, or failure to obtain, necessary clearances or approvals for our new products could delay or preclude realization of product revenues from new products or result in substantial additional costs which could decrease our profitability.\nIf we are unable to successfully grow our business through business relationships and acquisitions, our business may be materially and adversely affected.\nPromising partnerships and acquisitions may not be completed for reasons such as competition among prospective partners or buyers, our inability to reach satisfactory terms, or the need for regulatory approvals. Any acquisition that we complete may be dilutive to earnings and require the investment of significant resources. The economic environment may constrain our ability to access the capital needed for acquisitions and other capital investments.\nA significant portion of our revenue derives from the sale of blood collection supplies. Declines in the number of blood collection procedures have adversely impacted our business and future declines may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe demand for whole blood disposable products in the U.S. continued to decrease in fiscal 2017 and 2016 due to a sustained decline in transfusion rates and actions taken by hospitals to improve blood management techniques and protocols. In response to this trend, U.S. blood center collection groups prefer single source vendors for their whole blood collection products and are primarily focused on obtaining the lowest average selling prices. While we began to see a moderation in the rate of market decline during fiscal 2017, we expect to see continued declines in transfusion rates and the market to remain price-focused and highly competitive for the foreseeable future. Continued declines in this market could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and results of operations.\nConsolidation of the healthcare providers and blood collectors has increased demand for price concessions and caused the exclusion of suppliers from significant market segments, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPolitical, economic and policy influences are causing the healthcare and blood collection industries to make substantial structural and financial changes that affect our results of operations. Government and private sector initiatives limiting the growth of healthcare costs and causing structural reforms in healthcare delivery, including the reduction in blood use and reduced payments for care. These trends have placed greater pricing pressure on suppliers, decreased average selling prices and increased the number of sole source relationships. This pressure impacts our Hemostasis Management, Cell Processing and Blood Center businesses.\nThe expansion of group purchasing organizations in the United States, integrated delivery networks and large single accounts puts direct price pressure on our Hospital business. It also puts price pressure on our U.S. Blood Center customers who are also facing reduced demand for red cells. Our Blood Center customers have responded to this pressure by creating their own group purchasing organizations and resorting to single source tenders to create incentives for suppliers, including us, to significantly reduce prices.\nWe expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies, government contracting requirements and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide healthcare industry, resulting in further business consolidations and alliances among our customers and competitors. This may exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nQuality problems with our processes, goods, and services could harm our reputation for producing high-quality products and erode our competitive advantage, sales, and market share.\nQuality is extremely important to us and our customers due to the serious and costly consequences of product failure. Our quality certifications are critical to the marketing success of our products and services. If we fail to meet these standards or fail to adapt to evolving standards, our reputation could be damaged, we could lose customers, and our revenue and results of operations could decline.\nIn June 2016, we issued a voluntary recall of certain whole blood collection kits sold to our Blood Center customers in the United States. The recall resulted from some collection sets' filters failing to adequately remove leukocytes from collected blood. Because most U.S. hospitals prefer to transfuse leukoreduced blood, our Blood Center customers may have conducted further tests to confirm the blood was adequately leukoreduced, sold the blood as non-leukoreduced at a lower price or discarded the blood collected using the defective sets. As a result of the recall, we recorded total charges of $7.1 million during fiscal 2017 and have an insurance receivable of $2.9 million as of April 1, 2017. While we believe we have adequate insurance coverage, we may have additional losses in future periods which may or may not be covered by insurance. These losses could have a material impact on our results of operations.\nAn interruption in our ability to manufacture our products, obtain key components or raw materials, or the failure of a sole source supplier may adversely affect our business.\nCertain key products are manufactured at single locations with limited alternate facilities. If an event occurs that results in damage to one or more of these facilities, we may be unable to supply the relevant products at previous levels or at all.\nIn addition, for reasons of quality assurance or cost effectiveness, we purchase certain finished goods, components and raw materials from sole suppliers, notably JMS Co. Ltd., Kawasumi Laboratories and Sanmina Corporation, which is the sole manufacturer of all our apheresis equipment.\nDue to the stringent regulations and requirements of the FDA and other similar non-U.S. regulatory agencies regarding the manufacture of our products, we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components or materials. A reduction or interruption in manufacturing, or an inability to secure alternative sources of raw materials or components, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOngoing delays in expanding our liquid solutions production capacity could reduce our revenue, increase our costs, or prevent us from meeting contracted obligations, which could result in financial penalties and have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe primarily produce two solutions for use in our apheresis procedures: anti-coagulant and saline. Anti-coagulant is required for each apheresis procedure, including the collection of platelets and plasma. Saline is used by our Plasma customers to provide fluid replacement after a donation.\nWe have been working to expand the capacity of our Union, South Carolina facility to produce both anti-coagulant and saline. We have experienced delays in the completion of the project that have required us and a customer to rely on alternative sources of supply. If we are unable to successfully complete the capacity expansion or obtain additional supplies at an appropriate price, our results of operations could continue to be adversely affected.\nPlastics are the principal component of our disposables, which are the main source of our revenues. Any change in the price, composition or availability of the plastics we purchase could adversely affect our business.\nWe face risks related to price, composition and availability of the plastic raw materials used in our business.\nIncreases in the price of petroleum derivatives could result in corresponding increases in our costs to procure plastic raw materials. Increases in the costs of other commodities also may affect our procurement costs to a lesser degree.\nThe composition of the plastic we purchase is also important. Today, we purchase plastics which contain phthalates, which are used to make plastic malleable. Should plastics with phthalates become unavailable due to regulatory changes, we may be required to obtain regulatory approvals from FDA and foreign authorities for a number of products.\nWhile we have not experienced shortages in the past, any interruption in the supply for certain plastics could have a material impact on our business by limiting our ability to manufacture and sell the products which represent a significant portion of our revenues.\nAs approximately half of our revenue comes from outside the United States, we are subject to negative impacts on our results of operations from currency fluctuation, geopolitical events, economic volatility, violations of anti-corruption laws, export and import restrictions, decisions by local regulatory authorities and the laws and medical practices in foreign jurisdictions.\nWe do business in over 100 countries and have distributors in approximately 90 countries. This exposes us to currency fluctuation, geopolitical risk, economic volatility, anti-corruption laws, export and import restrictions, local regulatory authorities and the laws and medical practices in foreign jurisdictions.\nIf there are sanctions or restrictions on the flow of capital which prevent product importation or receipt of payments in Russia or China, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur international operations are governed by the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and other similar anti-corruption laws in other countries. Generally, these laws prohibit companies and their business partners or other intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign governments and government officials in order to obtain or retain business. Global enforcement of such anti-corruption laws has increased in recent years, including aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings. While we have an active compliance program and various other safeguards to discourage impermissible practices, we have distributors in approximately 90 countries, several of which are considered high risk for corruption. As a result, our global operations carry some risk of unauthorized impermissible activity on the part of one of our distributors, employees, agents or consultants. Any alleged or actual violation could subject us to government scrutiny, severe criminal or civil fines, or sanctions on our ability to export product outside the U.S., which could adversely affect our reputation and financial condition.\nExport of U.S. technology or goods manufactured in the United States to some jurisdictions requires special U.S. export authorization or local market controls that may be influenced by factors, including political dynamics, outside our control.\nFinally, any other significant changes in the competitive, legal, regulatory, reimbursement or economic environments of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our international business could have a material impact on our business.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel needed to successfully operate the business.\nWe constantly monitor the dynamics of the economy, the healthcare industry and the markets in which we compete; and we continue to assess our key personnel that we believe are essential to our long-term success. Over the last year, we have hired a new Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and new personnel in a number of key executive positions. We have also effected significant organizational and strategic changes in connection with the addition of these new executives. If we fail to effectively manage our ongoing organizational and strategic changes, our financial condition, results of operations, and reputation, as well as our ability to successfully attract, motivate and retain key employees, could be harmed.\nOur success also depends upon our ability to attract and retain other qualified managerial and technical personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense. We may not be able to attract and retain personnel necessary for the development of our business.\nIf we are unable to meet our debt obligations or experience a disruption in our cash flows, it could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cost of borrowing.\nWe have $315.4 million of debt outstanding at April 1, 2017 due before July 1, 2019. The obligations to pay interest and repay the borrowed amounts may restrict our ability to adjust to adverse economic conditions and our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements. The interest rate on the loan is variable and subject to change based on market forces. Fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect our profitability and cash flows.\nIn addition, as a global corporation, we have significant cash reserves held in foreign countries. These balances may not be immediately available to repay our debt.\nOur credit facilities contain financial covenants that require us to maintain specified financial ratios and make interest and principal payments. If we are unable to satisfy these covenants, we may be required to obtain waivers from our lenders. No assurance can be made that our lenders would grant such waivers on favorable terms, or at all, and we could be required to repay any borrowed amounts on short notice.\nOur operations and plans for future growth may require additional capital that may not be available to us, or only available to us on unfavorable terms.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including operating requirements, product placements, current and future acquisitions and the need to refinance existing debt. Our ability to issue additional debt or enter into other financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected by our debt levels, unfavorable changes in economic conditions generally or uncertainties that affect the capital markets. Higher borrowing costs or the inability to access capital markets could adversely affect our ability to support future growth and operating requirements and, as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. As of April 1, 2017, we had $315.4 million of debt obligations due before July 1, 2019. Refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources within our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of our debt obligations.\nWe recorded goodwill and other asset impairment charges that reduced our income during the current fiscal year and may record additional charges in future periods.\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually, or on an interim basis between annual tests when events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and concluded that we had an impairment of $57.0 million in our North America Blood Center reporting unit, which represented the entire goodwill balance associated with this reporting unit. There were no other reporting units at risk of impairment as of the fiscal 2017 annual test date. The impairment charge recorded does not impact our liquidity, cash flows from operations, future operations, or compliance with debt covenants.\nDuring fiscal 2017, we performed a review of certain non-core and underperforming assets that were at risk of being impaired due to the recent changes in our strategic direction. This review resulted in the decision to discontinue the use of and investment in certain long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. Accordingly, during fiscal 2017, we recorded asset impairment charges of $18.1 million associated with this review. The impairment charges recorded do not impact our liquidity, cash flows from operations, future operations, or compliance with debt covenants.\nFuture goodwill impairment charges or other asset impairment charges, if any, could materially adversely impact our results of operations in the period in which they are recorded. We will continue to monitor our intangible assets for potential impairments in future periods. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies within our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of key assumptions used in our testing.\nAs a medical device manufacturer we are subject to a number of laws and regulations. Non-compliance with those laws or regulations could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe manufacture, distribution and marketing of our products are subject to regulation by the FDA and other non-United States regulatory bodies. We must obtain specific regulatory clearance prior to selling any new product or service, a process which is costly and time consuming. If we are unable to obtain the necessary regulatory clearance we will be unable to introduce new enhanced product. Our operations are also subject to continuous review and monitoring by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Failure to substantially comply with applicable regulations could subject our products to recall or seizure by government authorities, or an order to suspend manufacturing activities. If our products were determined to have design or manufacturing flaws, this could result in their recall or seizure. Either of these situations could also result in the imposition of fines.\nThe European Union regulatory bodies are expected to finalize a new Medical Device Regulation (MDR) in calendar year 2017, replacing the existing directives and providing three years for transition and compliance. The MDR is expected to change several aspects of the existing regulatory framework, such as clinical data requirements, and introduce new ones, such as Unique Device Identification. We, and the notified bodies who will oversee compliance to the new MDR, face uncertainties as the MDR is rolled out and enforced, creating risks in several areas including the CE Marking process and data transparency in the upcoming years.\nWe operate in an industry susceptible to significant product liability claims. Product liability claims could damage our reputation and impair our ability to market our products or obtain professional or product liability insurance, or increase the cost of such insurance.\nOur products are relied upon by medical personnel in connection with the treatment of patients and the collection of blood or blood components from donors. In the event that patients or donors sustain injury or death in connection with their condition or treatment, we, along with others, may be sued, and whether or not we are ultimately determined to be liable, we may incur significant legal expenses. These claims may be brought by individuals seeking relief on their own behalf or purporting to represent a class. In addition, product liability claims may be asserted against us in the future based on events we are not aware of at the present time.\nIn addition, such litigation could damage our reputation and, therefore, impair our ability to market our products or obtain professional or product liability insurance, or increase the cost of such insurance. While we believe that our current product liability insurance coverage is sufficient, there is no assurance that such coverage will be adequate to cover incurred liabilities or that we will be able to obtain acceptable product and professional liability coverage in the future.\nMany of our competitors have significantly greater financial means and resources, which may allow them to more rapidly develop new technologies and more quickly address changes in customer requirements.\nOur ability to remain competitive depends on a combination of factors. Certain factors are within our control such as reputation, regulatory approvals, patents, unpatented proprietary know-how in several technological areas, product quality, safety, cost effectiveness and continued rigorous documentation of clinical performance. Other factors are outside of our control such as regulatory standards, medical standards, reimbursement policies and practices, and the practice of medicine.\nAs a global corporation, we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.\nInternational revenues and expenses account for a substantial portion of our operations. In fiscal 2017, our international revenues accounted for 41.0% of our total revenues. The exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes different forms. Reported revenues, as well as manufacturing and operational costs denominated in foreign currencies by our international businesses, fluctuate due to exchange rate movement when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. Fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our profitability in U.S. dollars of products and services sold by us into international markets, where payment for our products and services and related manufacturing and operational costs is made in local currencies.\nWe are entrusted with sensitive personal information in the course of operating our business and serving our customers. If we suffer a breach of security, our reputation could be harmed and we could incur costs or liabilities.\nGovernment agencies require that we implement measures to ensure the integrity and security of such personal data and, in the event of a breach of protocol, that we inform affected individuals. If our systems are not properly designed or implemented, or\nsuffer a breach of security or an intrusion (e.g., \u201chacking\u201d) by unauthorized persons, our reputation could be harmed, and we could incur costs and liabilities to affected persons and enforcement agencies.\nWe rely on the proper function, availability and security of information technology systems to operate our business and to serve our customers and a cyber-attack or other breach of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe rely on information technology systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations. Similar to other large multi-national companies, the size and complexity of our information technology systems makes them vulnerable to a cyber-attack, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy, or other significant disruption. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect, and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards, the increasing need to protect patient and customer information, and changing customer patterns. In addition, third parties may attempt to hack into our products to obtain data relating to patients with our products or our proprietary information. Any failure by us to maintain or protect our information technology systems and data integrity, including from cyber-attacks, intrusions or other breaches, could result in the unauthorized access to patient data and personally identifiable information, theft of intellectual property or other misappropriation of assets, or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations. Any of these events, in turn, may cause us to lose existing customers, have difficulty preventing, detecting, and controlling fraud, have disputes with customers, physicians, and other health care professionals, be subject to legal claims and liability, have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed, have increases in operating expenses, incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach or theft of intellectual property, or suffer other adverse consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to the risks associated with communicable diseases. A significant outbreak of a disease could reduce the demand for our products and affect our ability to provide our customers with products and services.\nAn eligible donor\u2019s willingness to donate is affected by concerns about their personal health and safety. Concerns about communicable diseases (such as pandemic flu, SARS, or HIV) could reduce the number of donors, and accordingly reduce the demand for our products for a period of time. A significant outbreak of a disease could also affect our employees\u2019 ability to work, which could limit our ability to produce product and service our customers.\nThere is a risk that our intellectual property may be subject to misappropriation in some countries.\nCertain countries, particularly China, do not enforce compliance with laws that protect intellectual property rights with the same degree of vigor as is available under the United States and European systems of justice. Further, certain of our intellectual property rights are not registered in China, or if they were, have since expired. This may permit others to produce copies of products in China that are not covered by currently valid patent registrations. There is also a risk that such products may be exported from China to other countries.\nIn order to aggressively protect our intellectual property throughout the world, we have a program of patent disclosures and filings in markets where we conduct significant business. While we believe this program is reasonable and adequate, the risk of loss is inherent in litigation as different legal systems offer different levels of protection to IP, and it is still possible that even patented technologies may not be protected absolutely from infringement.\nPending and future intellectual property litigation could be costly and disruptive to us.\nWe operate in an industry that is susceptible to significant intellectual property litigation. This type of litigation is expensive, complex and lengthy and its outcome is difficult to predict. Patent litigation may result in adverse outcomes and could significantly divert the attention of our technical and management personnel.\nOur products may be determined to infringe another party's patent, which could lead to financial losses or adversely affect our ability to market our products.\nThere is a risk that one or more of our products may be determined to infringe a patent held by another party. If this were to occur, we may be subject to an injunction or to payment of royalties, or both, which may adversely affect our ability to market the affected product(s) or otherwise have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, competitors may patent technological advances which may give them a competitive advantage or create barriers to entry.\nWe sell our products in certain emerging economies which exposes us to less mature regulatory systems, more volatile markets for our products, and greater credit risks. A loss of funding for our products or changes to the regulatory regime could lead to lost revenue or account receivables.\nThere are risks with doing business in emerging economies, such as Brazil, Russia, India and China. These economies tend to have less mature product regulatory systems and more volatile financial markets. In addition, the government controlled health care system's ability to invest in our products and systems may abruptly shift due to changing government priorities or funding capacity. Our ability to sell products in these economies is dependent upon our ability to hire qualified employees or agents to represent our products locally, and our ability to obtain and maintain the necessary regulatory approvals in a less mature regulatory environment. If we are unable to retain qualified representatives or maintain the necessary regulatory approvals, we will not be able to continue to sell products in these markets. We are exposed to a higher degree of financial risk if we extend credit to customers in these economies.\nIn many of the international markets in which we do business, including certain parts of Europe, South America, the Middle East, Russia and Asia, our employees, agents or distributors offer to sell our products in response to public tenders issued by various governmental agencies.\nThere is additional risk in selling our products through agents or distributors, particularly in public tenders. If they misrepresent our products, do not provide appropriate service and delivery, or commit a violation of local or U.S. law, our reputation could be harmed, and we could be subject to fines, sanctions or both.\nWe have a complex global supply chain which includes key sole source suppliers. Disruptions to this system could delay our ability to deliver finished products.\nWe have a complex global supply chain which involves integrating key suppliers and our manufacturing capacity into a global movement of components and finished goods.\nWe have certain key suppliers, including JMS Co. Ltd., Kawasumi Laboratories and Sanmina Corporation, who have their own complex supply chains throughout Asia.\nAny disruption to one or more of our suppliers\u2019 production or delivery of sufficient volumes of components conforming to our specifications could disrupt or delay our ability to deliver finished products to our customers. For example, we purchase components in Asia for use in manufacturing in the United States, Puerto Rico and Mexico. We source all of our apheresis equipment from Asia and regularly ship finished goods from the United States, Puerto Rico and Mexico to the rest of the world.\nDue to the high standards and FDA requirements applicable to manufacturing our products, such as the FDA's Quality System Regulation and Good Manufacturing Practices, we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain raw materials, components or finished goods. We might be forced to purchase substantial inventory, if available, to last until we are able to qualify an alternate supplier.\nIf we cannot obtain a necessary component, we may need to find, test and obtain regulatory approval or clearance for a replacement component, produce the component ourselves or redesign the related product, which would cause significant delay and could increase our manufacturing costs.\nIn the event that we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of raw materials, components or finished goods on commercially reasonable terms or in a timely manner, our ability to manufacture our products on a timely and cost-competitive basis may be compromised, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur effective tax rate may fluctuate and we may incur obligations in tax jurisdictions in excess of amounts that have been accrued.\nAs a global company, we are subject to taxation in numerous countries, states and other jurisdictions. In preparing our financial statements, we record the amount of tax payable in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our future effective tax rate, however, may be lower or higher than prior years due to numerous factors, including a change in our geographic earnings mix, changes in the measurement of our deferred taxes, and recently enacted and future tax law changes in jurisdictions in which we operate. Changes in our operations, including headcount in Switzerland, Puerto Rico or Malaysia, could adversely affect our tax rate due to favorable tax rulings in these jurisdiction. We are also subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions, and tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes. Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and cash flows.\nChanges in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and/or liquidity.\nWe are subject to income taxes, non-income based taxes and tax audits, in both the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision and have established contingency reserves for material,\nknown tax exposures. However, the calculation of such tax exposures involves the application of complex tax laws and regulations in many jurisdictions, as well as interpretations as to the legality under various rules in certain jurisdictions. Therefore, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these disputes or other tax audits or that issues raised by tax authorities will be resolved at a financial cost that does not exceed our related reserves, and the actual outcomes of these disputes and other tax audits could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition.\nIn addition, further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise, including as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The OECD, which represents a coalition of member countries, has issued recommendations that, in some cases, would make substantial changes to numerous long-standing tax positions and principles. These contemplated changes, to the extent adopted by OECD members and/or other countries, could increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes.\nOur products are made with materials which are subject to regulation by governmental agencies. An agency's prohibition of certain compounds could disrupt our manufacturing operations and delivery of finished products to our customers.\nEnvironmental regulations may prohibit the use of certain compounds in products we market and sell in regulated markets. If we are unable to substitute suitable materials into our processes, our manufacturing operations may be disrupted. In addition, we may be obligated to disclose the origin of certain materials used in our products, including but not limited to, metals mined from locations which have been the site of human rights violations.\nWe have disclosed material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting relating to our accounting for inventory, which could adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows accurately and on a timely basis.\nIn connection with our assessment of internal controls over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we identified a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting relating to our accounting for inventory. For a discussion of our internal controls over financial reporting and a description of the identified material weakness, see Controls and Procedures contained in Item 9A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal controls over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nDuring fiscal 2017, management's assessment identified control deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting related to the valuation of our inventory and cost of goods sold. Specifically, we identified a deficiency in the internal controls executed to appropriately account for manufacturing variances in inventory on our consolidated balance sheet and cost of goods sold on our consolidated statements of operations. Management determined that its accounting process for amortizing manufacturing variances to cost of goods sold lacked adequate levels of monitoring and review controls to appropriately identify and correct errors in the calculation in a timely manner. While reported inventory and related accounts are accurate as of April 1, 2017, the material weakness resulted in errors in these accounts in prior periods. As a result of this deficiency, until it is substantially remediated, it is possible that internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect errors in the accounting for inventory as reflected in our financial statements.\nWhile actions have been taken to improve our internal controls in response to the identified material weakness related to certain aspects of accounting for inventory, additional work continues to address and remediate the identified material weaknesses. Until these actions are fully implemented and tested, the material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting relating to inventory will continue to exist. As a result, our ability to accurately report, on a timely basis, our future financial condition, results of operations or cash flows may be adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 76837, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "HAE"}
