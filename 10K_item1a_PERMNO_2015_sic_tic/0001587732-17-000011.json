{"cik": "1587732", "company": "ONE Gas, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-23", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur investors should consider the following risks that could affect us and our business. Although we have tried to discuss key factors, our investors need to be aware that other risks may prove to be important in the future. New risks may emerge at any time, and we cannot predict such risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect our financial performance. Investors should carefully consider the following discussion of risks and the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report, including \u201cForward-Looking Statements,\u201d which are included in Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nRISK FACTORS INHERENT IN OUR BUSINESS\nRegulatory actions could impact our ability to earn a reasonable rate of return on our invested capital and to fully recover our operating costs.\nIn addition to regulation by other governmental authorities, we are subject to regulation by the OCC, KCC, RRC and various municipalities in Texas. These authorities set the rates that we charge our customers for our services. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain rate increases or that our authorized rates of return will continue at the current levels. We monitor and compare the rates of return we achieve with our allowed rates of return and initiate general and specific rate proceedings as needed. If a regulatory agency were to prohibit us from setting rates that allow for the timely recovery of our costs and a reasonable return by significantly lowering our allowed return or adversely altering our cost allocation, rate design or other tariff provisions, modifying or eliminating cost trackers, prohibiting recovery of regulatory assets or disallowing portions of our expenses, then our earnings could be adversely impacted. Regulatory proceedings also involve a risk of rate reduction, because once a proceeding has been filed, it is subject to challenge by various interveners.\nFurther, accounting principles that govern our company permit certain assets that result from the regulatory process to be recorded on our Balance Sheets that could not be recorded under GAAP for nonregulated entities. We consider factors such as rate orders from regulators, previous rate orders for substantially similar costs, written approval from the regulators and analysis of recoverability by internal and external legal counsel to determine the probability of future recovery of these assets. If we determine future recovery is no longer probable, we would be required to write off the regulatory assets at that time, which would also adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. Regulatory authorities also review whether our natural gas costs are prudent and can adjust the amount of our natural gas costs that we pass through to our customers. If any of our natural gas costs were disallowed, our results of operations and cash flows would also be adversely affected.\nIn the normal course of business in the regulatory environment, assets are placed in service before regulatory action is taken, such as filing a rate case or for interim recovery under a capital tracking mechanism that could result in an adjustment of our returns. Once we make a regulatory filing, regulatory bodies have the authority to suspend implementation of the new rates while studying the filing. Because of this process, we may suffer the negative financial effects of having placed in service assets that do not initially earn our authorized rate of return or may not be allowed recovery on such expenditures at all.\nThe profitability of our operations is dependent on our ability to timely recover the costs related to providing natural gas service to our customers. However, we are unable to predict the impact that new regulatory requirements will have on our operating expenses or the level of capital expenditures and we cannot give assurance that our regulators will continue to allow recovery of such expenditures in the future. Changes in the regulatory environment applicable to our business or the imposition of additional regulation could impair our ability to recover costs absorbed historically by our customers, and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are subject to comprehensive energy regulation by governmental agencies, and the recovery of our costs is dependent on regulatory action.\nWe are subject to comprehensive regulation by several state and municipal utility regulatory agencies, which significantly influences our operating environment and our ability to recover our costs from utility customers. The utility regulatory authorities in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas regulate many aspects of our utility operations, including organization, safety, financing, affiliate transactions, customer service and the terms of service to customers, including the rates that we can charge customers. The profitability of our operations is dependent on our ability to pass through costs related to providing natural gas to our customers by filing periodic rate cases. The regulatory environment applicable to our operations could impair our ability to recover costs historically absorbed by our customers. In addition, as the regulatory environment applicable to our operations increases in complexity, the risk of inadvertent noncompliance could also increase. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines, penalties or other enforcement action by the authorities that regulate our operations.\nWe are unable to predict the impact that the future regulatory activities of these agencies will have on our operations. Changes in regulations or the imposition of additional regulations could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, the results of our operations could be impacted adversely if our authorized cost-recovery mechanisms do not function as anticipated.\nWe are involved in legal or administrative proceedings before various courts and governmental bodies that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn the normal course of business, we are involved in legal or administrative proceedings before various courts and governmental bodies with respect to general claims, rates, environmental issues, gas cost prudence reviews and other matters. Adverse decisions regarding these matters, to the extent they require us to make payments in excess of amounts provided for in our financial statements, or to the extent they are not covered by insurance, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nUnfavorable economic and market conditions could adversely affect our earnings.\nWeakening economic activity in our markets could result in a loss of existing customers, fewer new customers, especially in newly constructed homes and other buildings, or a decline in energy consumption, any of which could adversely affect our revenues or restrict our future growth. It may become more difficult for customers to pay their natural gas bills, leading to slow collections and higher-than-normal levels of accounts receivable, which in turn could increase our financing requirements and bad debt expense. Changes in monetary or other policies of the federal or state governments may adversely affect the economic climate for the United States, the regions in which we operate or particular industries, such as ours or those of our customers. The foregoing could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIncreases in the price of natural gas could reduce our earnings, increase our working capital requirements and adversely impact our customer base.\nChanges in supply and demand within the natural gas markets, as well as other factors, could cause an increase in the price of natural gas. The increased production in the U.S. of natural gas from shale formations has put downward pressure on the wholesale cost of natural gas; however, other factors could put upward pressure on natural gas prices, including restrictions or regulations on shale natural gas production and waste water disposal, increased demand from natural gas fueled electric power generation and increases in natural gas exports. Additionally, the CFTC under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act has regulatory authority of the over-the-counter derivatives markets. Regulations affecting derivatives could increase the price of our natural gas supply. Also, the threat of terrorist activities or heightened international tensions could lead to increased economic instability and volatility in the price of natural gas.\nNatural gas costs are passed through to our customers based on the actual cost of the natural gas we purchase. However, an increase in the price of natural gas could cause us to experience a significant increase in short-term debt because we must pay suppliers for natural gas when purchased. Costs are recovered through our collection on customer bills following consumption by our customers. The delay in recovery of our natural gas costs could adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows.\nFurther, higher and more volatile natural gas prices may adversely impact our customers\u2019 perception of natural gas. Substantial fluctuations in natural gas prices can occur from year to year and sustained periods of high natural gas prices or of pronounced natural gas price volatility may lead to customers selecting other energy alternatives, such as electricity, and to increased scrutiny of the prudency of our natural gas procurement strategies and practices by our regulators. It may also cause new home developers, builders and new customers to select alternative sources of energy. Additionally, high natural gas prices may cause customers to conserve more and may also adversely impact our accounts receivable collections, resulting in higher bad debt expense. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as well as our future growth opportunities.\nOur risk-management policies and procedures may not be effective, and employees may violate our risk-management policies.\nWe have implemented a set of policies and procedures that involve both our senior management and the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors to assist us in managing risks associated with our business. These risk-management policies and procedures are intended to align strategies, processes, people, information technology and business knowledge so that risk is managed throughout the organization. However, as conditions change and become more complex, current risk measures may fail to assess adequately the relevant risk due to changes in the market and the presence of risks previously unknown to us.\nAdditionally, if employees fail to adhere to our policies and procedures or if our policies and procedures are not effective, potentially because of future conditions or risks outside of our control, we may be exposed to greater risk than we had intended. Ineffective risk-management policies and procedures or violation of risk-management policies and procedures could have an adverse effect on our earnings, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur business is subject to competition that could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe natural gas distribution business is competitive, and we face competition from other companies that supply energy, including electric companies, propane dealers, renewable energy providers and coal companies in relation to sources of energy for electric power plants, as well as nuclear energy. Significant competitive factors include efficiency, quality and reliability of the services we provide and price.\nThe most significant product competition occurs between natural gas and electricity in the residential and small commercial markets. Natural gas competes with electricity for water and space heating, cooking, clothes drying and other general energy needs. Increases in the price of natural gas or decreases in the price of other energy sources could adversely impact our competitive position by decreasing the price benefits of natural gas to the consumer. Customers and builders typically make the decision on the type of equipment at initial installation and use the chosen energy source for the life of the equipment. Changes in the competitive position of natural gas relative to electricity and other energy products have the potential to cause a decline in consumption or in the number of natural gas customers.\nConsumer or government-mandated conservation efforts, higher natural gas costs or decreases in the price of other energy sources also may encourage decreases in natural gas consumption and allow competition from alternative energy sources for applications that have used natural gas, encouraging some customers to move away from natural gas-fired equipment to equipment fueled by other energy sources. Competition between natural gas and other forms of energy is also based on efficiency, performance, reliability, safety, environmental and other nonprice factors. Technological improvements in other energy sources and events that impair the public perception of the nonprice attributes of natural gas could erode our competitive advantage. These factors in turn could decrease the demand for natural gas, impair our ability to attract new customers, and cause existing customers to switch to other forms of energy or to bypass our systems in favor of alternative competitive sources. This could result in slow or no customer growth and could cause customers to reduce or cease using our product, thereby reducing our ability to make capital expenditures and otherwise grow our business and adversely affecting our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business activities are concentrated in three states.\nWe provide natural gas distribution services to customers in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas. Changes in the regional economies, politics, regulations and weather patterns of these states could adversely impact the growth opportunities available to us and the usage patterns and financial condition of our customers. This could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe availability of adequate natural gas pipeline transportation and storage capacity and natural gas supply may decrease and impair our ability to meet customers\u2019 natural gas requirements and reduce our earnings.\nIn order to meet customers\u2019 natural gas demands, we must obtain sufficient natural gas supplies, pipeline transportation and storage capacity from third parties. If we are unable to obtain these, our ability to meet our customers\u2019 natural gas requirements could be impaired and our financial condition and results of operations may be impacted adversely. A significant disruption to or reduction in natural gas supply, pipeline capacity or storage capacity due to events including, but not limited to, operational failures or disruptions, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, freeze off of natural gas wells, terrorist or cyber-attacks or other acts of war, or legislative or regulatory actions, could reduce our normal supply of natural gas and thereby reduce our earnings.\nA downgrade in our credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of and ability to access capital.\nOur ability to obtain adequate and cost-effective financing depends in part on our credit ratings. A reduction in our ratings by our rating agencies could adversely affect our costs of borrowing and/or access to sources of liquidity and capital. Such a downgrade could further limit or delay our access to public and private credit markets and increase the costs of borrowing under available credit lines. Should our credit ratings be downgraded, it could limit or delay our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions. An increase in borrowing costs without the ability to recover these higher costs in the rates charged to our customers could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows by limiting our ability to earn our allowed rate of return.\nWe are subject to new and existing laws and regulations that may require significant expenditures or significant increases in operating costs or result in significant fines or penalties for noncompliance.\nOur business and operations are subject to regulation by a number of federal agencies, including FERC, DOT, OSHA, EPA, CFTC and various regulatory agencies in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas, and we are subject to numerous federal and state laws and regulations. Future changes to laws, regulations and policies may impair our ability to compete for business or to recover costs and may increase the cost of our operations. Furthermore, because the language in some laws and regulations is not prescriptive, there is a risk that our interpretation of these laws and regulations may not be consistent with expectations of regulators. Any compliance failure related to these laws and regulations may result in fines, penalties or injunctive measures affecting our operating assets. For example, under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the FERC has civil penalty authority under the Natural Gas Act of 1938, as amended, to impose penalties for current violations of up to $1 million per day for each violation. In addition, as the regulatory environment for our industry increases in complexity, the risk of inadvertent noncompliance could also increase. Our failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, credit rating or reputation.\nWe are subject to strict regulations at many of our facilities regarding employee safety, and failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our financial results.\nThe workplaces associated with our facilities are subject to the requirements of DOT and OSHA, and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. The failure to comply with DOT, OSHA and state requirements or general industry standards, including keeping adequate records or preventing occupational exposure to regulated substances, could expose us to civil or criminal liability, enforcement actions, and regulatory fines and penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to environmental regulations, which could adversely affect our operations or financial results.\nWe are subject to laws, regulations and other legal requirements enacted or adopted by federal, state and local governmental authorities relating to environmental and health and safety matters, including those legal requirements that govern discharges of substances into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and waste, the clean-up of contaminated sites, groundwater quality and availability, plant and wildlife protection, as well as work practices related to employee health and safety. Environmental legislation also requires that our facilities, sites and other properties associated with our operations be operated, maintained, abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities. The failure to comply with these laws, regulations and other requirements, or the discovery of presently unknown environmental conditions, could expose us to civil or criminal liability, enforcement actions and regulatory fines and penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe also own or retain legal responsibility for certain environmental conditions at 12 former manufactured natural gas sites in Kansas. A number of environmental issues may exist with respect to manufactured gas plants. Accordingly, future costs are dependent on the final determination and regulatory approval of any remedial actions, the complexity of the site, level of remediation, changing technology and governmental regulations and could be material to our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWith the trend toward stricter standards, greater regulation and more extensive permit requirements for the types of assets operated by us that are subject to environmental regulation, our environmental expenditures could increase in the future, and such expenditures may not be fully recovered by insurance or recoverable in rates from our customers, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to pipeline safety and system integrity laws and regulations that may require significant expenditures, significant increases in operating costs or, in the case of noncompliance, substantial fines.\nWe are subject to the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act, which requires companies like us that operate high-pressure pipelines to perform integrity assessments on pipeline segments that pass through densely populated areas or near specifically designated high-consequence areas. Further, the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty and Job Creation Act increased the maximum penalties for violating federal pipeline safety regulations and directed the DOT and Secretary of Transportation to conduct further review or studies on issues that may or may not be material to us. Compliance with existing or new laws and regulations may result in increased capital, operating and other costs which may not be recoverable in rates from our customers or may impact materially our competitive position relative to other energy providers. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations may result in fines, penalties or injunctive measures that would not be recoverable from customers in rates and could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The failure to comply\nwith these laws, regulations and other requirements could expose us to civil or criminal liability, enforcement actions, and regulatory fines and penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and reputation.\nClimate change, carbon neutral or energy-efficiency legislation or regulations could increase our operating costs or restrict our market opportunities, adversely affecting our growth, cash flows and results of operations.\nInternational, federal, regional and/or state legislative and/or regulatory initiatives may attempt to control or limit the causes of climate change, including greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide and methane. Such laws or regulations could impose costs tied to carbon emissions, operational requirements or restrictions, or additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities. They could also provide a cost advantage to alternative energy sources, impose costs or restrictions on end users of natural gas, or result in other costs or requirements, such as costs associated with the adoption of new infrastructure and technology to respond to new mandates. The focus on climate change could adversely impact the reputation of fossil fuel products or services. The occurrence of the foregoing events could put upward pressure on the cost of natural gas relative to other energy sources, increase our costs and the prices we charge to customers, reduce the demand for natural gas or cause fuel switching to other energy sources, and impact the competitive position of natural gas and the ability to serve new or existing customers, adversely affecting our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate change.\nThere is a growing belief that emissions of greenhouse gases may be linked to global climate change. Climate change creates physical and financial risk. Our customers\u2019 energy needs vary with weather conditions, primarily temperature and humidity. For residential customers, heating and cooling represent their largest energy use. To the extent weather conditions may be affected by climate change, customers\u2019 energy use could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of any changes. To the extent climate change adversely impacts the economic health of our operating territory, it could adversely impact customer demand or our customers\u2019 ability to pay. A decrease in energy use due to weather changes may affect our financial condition through decreased revenues and cash flows. Extreme weather conditions in general require more system backup, adding to costs, and can contribute to increased system stresses, including service interruptions. Weather conditions outside of our operating territory could also have an impact on our revenues and cash flows by affecting natural gas prices. Severe weather impacts our operating territories primarily through thunderstorms, tornados and snow or ice storms. To the extent the frequency of extreme weather events increases, our cost of providing service could increase. We may not be able to pass on the higher costs to our customers or recover all the costs related to mitigating these physical risks. To the extent financial markets view climate change and emissions of greenhouse gases as a financial risk, this could adversely affect our ability to access capital markets or cause us to receive less favorable terms and conditions in future financings. Our business could be affected by the potential for lawsuits related to or against greenhouse gas emitters based on the claimed connection between greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nDemand for natural gas is highly weather sensitive and seasonal, and weather conditions may cause our earnings to vary from year to year.\nOur earnings can vary from year to year, depending in part on weather conditions, which directly influence the volume of natural gas delivered to customers. Natural gas sales to residential and commercial customers are seasonal, as a substantial portion of their natural gas requirements are for heating during the winter months. Warmer-than-normal weather can reduce our utility margins as customer consumption declines. We have implemented weather normalization mechanisms for our sales to customers in Oklahoma, Kansas and portions of Texas, which are designed to limit our earnings sensitivity to weather. Weather normalization mechanisms require us to increase customer billings to offset lower natural gas usage when weather is warmer than normal and decrease customer billings to offset higher natural gas usage when weather is colder than normal. If our rates and tariffs are modified to curtail such weather protection programs, then we would be exposed to additional risk associated with weather. As a result of occurrences of the foregoing, our results of operations and cash flows could vary and be impacted adversely.\nWe may not be able to complete necessary or desirable expansion or infrastructure development projects, which may delay or prevent us from serving our customers or expanding our business.\nIn order to serve new customers or expand our service to existing customers, we may need to maintain, expand or upgrade our distribution and/or transmission infrastructure, including laying new distribution lines. Various factors may prevent or delay us from completing such projects or make completion more costly, such as the inability to obtain required approval from local, state and/or federal regulatory and governmental bodies, public opposition to the project, inability to obtain adequate financing,\ncompetition for labor and materials, construction delays, cost overruns, and inability to negotiate acceptable agreements relating to construction or other material components of an infrastructure development project. As a result, we may not be able to serve adequately existing customers or support customer growth, which would adversely impact our business, stakeholder perception, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may pursue acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic opportunities, the success of which may adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nAs part of our strategic objectives, we may pursue acquisitions to complement or expand our business, as well as divestitures and other strategic opportunities. We may not be able to successfully negotiate, finance or receive regulatory approval for future acquisitions or integrate the acquired businesses with our existing business and services. These efforts may also distract our management and employees from day-to-day operations and require substantial commitments of time and resources. Future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, a decrease in our liquidity as a result of our using a significant portion of our available cash or borrowing capacity to finance the acquisition, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities and amortization expenses and substantial goodwill. The effects of these strategic decisions may have long-term implications that are not likely to be known to us in the short-term. Changing political climates and public attitudes may adversely affect the ongoing acceptability of strategic decisions that have been made (and, in some cases, previously approved by regulators) to the detriment of the company. We may be affected materially and adversely if we are unable to successfully integrate businesses that we acquire.\nAn impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets could reduce our earnings.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had approximately $158 million of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet. Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price of a business exceeds the fair market value of the tangible and separately measurable intangible net assets. GAAP requires us to test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or when events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired. Long-lived assets with finite useful lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If we determine that impairment is indicated, we would be required to take an immediate noncash charge to earnings with a correlative effect on our equity and balance sheet leverage as measured by debt to total capitalization, which could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to access capital or our cost of capital may increase significantly.\nOur ability to obtain adequate and cost-effective financing is dependent upon the liquidity of the financial markets, in addition to our financial condition and credit ratings. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets could adversely affect our ability to access short-term and long-term capital. Access to funds under our ONE Gas Credit Agreement will be dependent on the ability of the participating banks to meet their funding commitments. Those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity. Disruptions and volatility in the global credit markets could cause the interest rate we pay on our ONE Gas Credit Agreement, which is based on LIBOR, to increase. This could result in higher interest rates on future financings, and could impact the liquidity of the lenders under our ONE Gas Credit Agreement, potentially impairing their ability to meet their funding commitments to us. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to capital needed for our business. The inability to access adequate capital or an increase in the cost of capital may require us to conserve cash, prevent or delay us from making capital expenditures, and require us to reduce or eliminate our dividend or other discretionary uses of cash. A significant reduction in our liquidity could cause a negative change in our ratings outlook or even a reduction in our credit ratings. This could in turn further limit our access to credit markets and increase our costs of borrowing.\nChanges in federal and state fiscal, tax and monetary policy could significantly increase our costs or decrease our cash flows.\nChanges in federal and state fiscal, tax and monetary policy may result in increased taxes, interest rates, and inflationary pressures on the costs of goods, services and labor. This could increase our expenses and capital spending and decrease our cash flows if we are not able to recover or recover timely such increased costs from our customers. This series of events may increase our rates to customers and thus may adversely impact customer billings and customer growth. Changes in tax rules could adversely affect our cash flows. Any of these events may cause us to increase debt, conserve cash, adversely affect our ability to make capital expenditures to grow the business or other discretionary uses of cash, and could adversely affect our cash flows.\nFederal, state and local jurisdictions may challenge our tax return positions.\nThe preparation of our federal and state tax return filings may require significant judgments, use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Significant judgment also is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items, and in determining the amount of any reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken that may be subject to challenge by taxing authorities. Despite management\u2019s expectation that our tax return positions will be fully supportable, certain positions may be challenged successfully by federal, state and local jurisdictions.\nAs a result of cross-default provisions in our borrowing arrangements, we may be unable to satisfy all of our outstanding obligations in the event of a default on our part.\nThe terms of our debt agreements contain cross-default provisions, which provide that we will be in default under such agreements in the event of certain defaults under other debt agreements. Accordingly, should an event of default occur under any of those agreements, we would face the prospect of being in default under all of our debt agreements, obliged in such instance to satisfy all of our outstanding indebtedness simultaneously. In such an event, we may not be able to obtain alternative financing or, if we are able to obtain such financing, we may not be able to obtain it on terms acceptable to us, which would adversely affect our ability to implement our business plan, have flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, make capital expenditures and finance our operations.\nThe cost of providing pension and other postemployment health care benefits to eligible employees and qualified retirees is subject to changes in pension fund values and changing demographics and may increase. In addition, the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in 2010 and its potential repeal and replacement could increase the cost of health care benefits for our employees. Further, the costs to us of providing such benefits and related funding requirements are subject to the continued and timely recovery of such costs through our rates.\nWe have defined benefit pension plans and other postemployment welfare plans for certain employees. Our defined benefit and other postemployment welfare plans are closed to new participants. Our other postemployment welfare plans only subsidize costs for providing postemployment medical benefits. The cost of providing these benefits to eligible current and former employees is subject to changes in the market value of our pension and other postemployment benefit plan assets, changing demographics, including longer life expectancy of plan participants and their beneficiaries, and changes in health care costs.\nAny sustained declines in equity markets and reductions in bond values may have a material adverse effect on the value of our pension and other postemployment benefit plan assets. In these circumstances, additional cash contributions to our pension and other postemployment benefit plans may be required, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and cash flows.\nIn addition, the costs of providing health care benefits to our employees could increase over the next five to ten years due in large part to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, and its potential repeal and replacement. The future costs of compliance with the provisions are difficult to measure at this time. Also, our costs of providing such benefits and related funding requirements could also materially increase in the future, depending on the timing of the recovery, if any, of such costs through our rates, which could adversely impact our financial condition and cash flows.\nOur business is subject to operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions that could materially and adversely affect our business and for which we may not be insured adequately.\nWe are subject to all of the risks and hazards typically associated with the natural gas distribution business. Operating risks include, but are not limited to, leaks, pipeline ruptures and the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes. Other operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions include adverse weather conditions, accidents, explosions, fires, the collision of equipment with our pipeline facilities (for example, this may occur if a third-party were to perform excavation or construction work near our facilities) and catastrophic events, such as tornados, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods or other similar events beyond our control. It is also possible that our facilities could be direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terrorism, including cyber attacks. A casualty occurrence might result in injury or loss of life, extensive property damage or environmental damage caused to or by employees, customers, contractors, vendors and other third parties. The location of pipeline facilities near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial gathering places, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. Liabilities incurred and interruptions to the operations of our pipelines or other facilities caused by such an event could reduce revenues generated by us and increase expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, our regulators may\nnot allow us to recover part or all of the increased cost related to the foregoing events from our customers, which would adversely affect our earnings and cash flows.\nUnanticipated events or a combination of events, failure in resources needed to respond to events, or slow or inadequate response to events may have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWhile we have general liability and property insurance currently in place in amounts that we consider appropriate based on our assessment of business risk and best practices in our industry and in general business, such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles. Further, we are not fully insured against all risks inherent in our business. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially, and, in some instances, certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. Consequently, we may not be able to renew existing insurance policies or purchase other desirable insurance on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nThe insurance proceeds received for any loss of, or any damage to, any of our facilities or to third parties may not be sufficient to restore the total loss or damage. Further, the proceeds of any such insurance may not be paid in a timely manner. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business increasingly relies on technology, the failure of which, or the occurrence of cyber security attacks thereon, or those of third parties, may adversely affect our financial results.\nDue to increased technology advances, we have become more reliant on technology to help increase efficiency in our business. We use computer programs to help run our financial and operations organizations, including an enterprise resource planning system that integrates data and reporting activities across our company. The failure of these or other similarly important technologies, the lack of alternative technologies, or our inability to have these technologies supported, updated, expanded or integrated into other technologies, could hinder our operations and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. The use of technological programs, systems and tools may subject our business to increased risks.\nOur business is dependent upon our operational systems to process a large amount of data and complex transactions. If any of our financial, operational or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings, our financial results could be affected adversely. Our financial results could also be affected adversely if an employee or third party causes our operational systems to fail, either as a result of inadvertent error or by deliberately tampering with or manipulating our operational systems. In addition, dependence upon automated systems may further increase the risk that operational system flaws, employee or third party tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect or mitigate.\nThere is no guarantee that the precautions we take to protect against unauthorized access to secured data on our systems are adequate to safeguard against all security breaches. Any future cyber security attacks, or threats of such attacks, that affect our distribution facilities, our customers, our suppliers and third party service providers or any financial data could have a material adverse effect on our businesses. As potential cyber security attacks become more common and sophisticated, we could be required to incur increased costs to strengthen our systems or to obtain additional insurance coverage against potential losses. In addition, cyber attacks, or threats of cyber attacks, on our company, customer and employee data may result in a financial loss and may adversely impact our reputation. Third-party systems on which we rely could also suffer operational system failure.\nThe foregoing events could adversely affect our business reputation, diminish customer confidence, disrupt operations, subject us to financial liability or increased regulation, increase our costs and expose us to material legal claims and liability, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be affected adversely.\nOur business could be adversely affected by strikes or work stoppages by our unionized employees.\nAt February 1, 2017, approximately 700 of our estimated 3,400 employees were represented by collective-bargaining units under collective-bargaining agreements. We are involved periodically in discussions with collective-bargaining units representing some of our employees to negotiate or renegotiate labor agreements. We cannot predict the results of these negotiations, including whether any failure to reach new agreements will have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations or whether we will be able to reach any agreement with the collective-bargaining units. Any failure to reach agreement on new labor contracts might result in a work stoppage. Any future work stoppage could, depending on the operations and the length of the work stoppage, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nA shortage of skilled labor may make it difficult for us to maintain labor productivity and competitive costs, which could adversely affect operations and cash flows. Further, we may be unable to attract and retain directors, management and professional and technical employees, which could adversely impact our earnings.\nOur operations require skilled and experienced workers with proficiency in multiple tasks. In recent years, a shortage of workers trained in various skills associated with the natural gas distribution business has caused us to conduct certain operations without full staff, thus hiring outside resources, which may decrease productivity and increase costs. This shortage of trained workers is the result of experienced workers reaching retirement age and increased competition for workers in certain areas, combined with the difficulty of attracting new workers to the natural gas distribution industry. This shortage of skilled labor could continue over an extended period. If the shortage of experienced labor continues or worsens, it could have an adverse impact on labor productivity and costs and our ability to meet the needs of our customers in the event there is an increase in the demand for our products and services, which could adversely affect our business and cash flows.\nOur ability to implement our business strategy, satisfy our regulatory requirements, and serve our customers is dependent upon our ability to continue to recruit qualified directors, employ talented managers and professionals and attract and retain a skilled, high-performing workforce. We are subject to the risk that we will not be able to effectively replace or transfer the knowledge and expertise of retiring directors or employees. Without effective succession, our ability to provide quality service to our customers and satisfy our regulatory requirements will be challenged, and this could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges in accounting standards may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to additional changes in GAAP, SEC regulations and other interpretations of financial reporting requirements for public utilities. We neither have control over the impact these changes may have on our financial condition or results of operations nor the timing of such changes.\nOur financing arrangements subject us to various restrictions that could limit our operating flexibility.\nThe covenants in the indenture governing our Senior Notes and our ONE Gas Credit Agreement restrict our ability to create or permit certain liens, to consolidate or merge or to convey, transfer or lease substantially all of our properties and assets.\nThe ONE Gas Credit Agreement includes a requirement that our debt to total capital ratio may not exceed 70 percent as of the end of any calendar quarter. Events beyond our control could impair our ability to satisfy this requirement. As long as our indebtedness remains outstanding, these restrictive covenants could impair our ability to expand or pursue our growth strategy. In addition, the breach of any covenants or any payment obligations in any of these debt agreements will result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument. If there were an event of default under one of our debt agreements, the holders of the defaulted debt may have the ability to cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable, subject to applicable grace periods. This could trigger cross-defaults under our other debt agreements, including our Senior Notes. Forced repayment of some or all of our indebtedness would reduce our available cash and have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nSome of our debt, including borrowings under our ONE Gas Credit Agreement and our commercial paper program, is based on variable rates of interest, which could result in higher interest expenses in the event of an increase in interest rates.\nIn the future, we could be exposed to fluctuations in variable interest rates. This increases our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates. Amounts borrowed under the ONE Gas Credit Agreement and commercial paper program are based on variable rates of interest. If these rates rise, the interest rate on this debt will also increase. Therefore, an increase in these rates may increase our interest payment obligations and have a negative effect on our cash flows and financial position.\nRISKS RELATING TO THE SEPARATION\nWe are responsible for certain contingent and other liabilities related to the historical natural gas distribution business of ONEOK, as well as a portion of any contingent corporate liabilities of ONEOK that do not relate to either the natural gas distribution business or ONEOK\u2019s remaining businesses.\nUnder the Separation and Distribution Agreement between us and ONEOK, we assumed and are responsible for certain contingent and other corporate liabilities related to the historical natural gas distribution business of ONEOK (including\nassociated costs and expenses, whether arising prior to, at, or after our separation). In addition, under the Separation and Distribution Agreement we are also responsible for a portion of any contingent corporate liabilities of ONEOK that do not relate to either our business or the business of ONEOK following the separation (for example, liabilities associated with certain corporate activities not specifically attributable to either business). If we are required to indemnify ONEOK or are otherwise liable for these liabilities, they may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThird parties may seek to hold us responsible for liabilities of ONEOK that we did not assume in our agreements.\nThird parties may seek to hold us responsible for retained liabilities of ONEOK. Under our agreements with ONEOK, ONEOK has agreed to indemnify us for claims and losses relating to these retained liabilities. However, if those liabilities are significant and we are ultimately held liable for them, we cannot assure that we will be able to recover the full amount of our losses from ONEOK.\nOur prior and continuing relationship with ONEOK exposes us to risks attributable to businesses of ONEOK.\nONEOK is obligated to indemnify us for losses that a party may seek to impose upon us or our affiliates for liabilities relating to the business of ONEOK. Any claims made against us that are properly attributable to ONEOK in accordance with these arrangements require us to exercise our rights under our agreements with ONEOK to obtain payment from ONEOK. We are exposed to the risk that, in these circumstances, ONEOK cannot, or will not, make the required payment.\nIf the distribution, together with certain related transactions, were to fail to qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355, 368(a)(1)(D) and other related provisions of the Code, then ONEOK and/or its shareholders could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities, and we could incur significant indemnity obligations.\nONEOK received an IRS Ruling to the effect that the distribution, together with certain related transactions, qualified as tax-free to ONEOK, us and the ONEOK shareholders under Sections 355, 368(a)(1)(D) and other related provisions of the Code. ONEOK also received an opinion of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, tax counsel to ONEOK, which opinion relies on the continued validity of the IRS Ruling, with respect to certain issues relating to the tax-free nature of the transactions that were not addressed in or covered by the IRS Ruling.\nThe IRS Ruling and the tax opinion rely upon certain assumptions, as well as statements, representations and certain undertakings made by our officers and the officers of ONEOK regarding the past and future conduct of the companies\u2019 respective businesses and other matters. If any of those statements, representations or assumptions are incorrect or untrue in any material respect or any of those undertakings are not complied with, the conclusions reached in the IRS Ruling or the opinion could be affected adversely, and ONEOK and/or its shareholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Notwithstanding the IRS Ruling and opinion of tax counsel, the IRS could determine on audit that the distribution, together with certain related transactions, was taxable if it determines that any of these statements, representations, assumptions, or undertakings were not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion that were not covered by the IRS Ruling, or for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of ONEOK or us after the distribution.\nIf the distribution were subsequently determined, for whatever reason, not to qualify as a transaction that is tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355, 368(a)(1)(D), and other related provisions of the Code, ONEOK and/or the holders of ONEOK common stock immediately prior to the distribution could incur significant tax liabilities, and, in certain circumstances as described further under \"Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence - Tax Matters Agreement,\" we will be required to indemnify ONEOK, its subsidiaries, and certain related persons for taxes and related expenses resulting from the distribution, which could be material. Any such indemnity obligation could have a materially adverse impact on our financial condition.\nTo preserve the tax-free treatment to ONEOK and/or its shareholders of the distribution and certain related transactions, we may not be able to engage in certain transactions.\nTo preserve the tax-free treatment to ONEOK and/or its shareholders of the distribution and certain related transactions, we are restricted, under the Tax Matters Agreement between us and ONEOK, from taking any action that prevents such transactions from being tax-free for U.S. federal, state and local income tax purposes. These restrictions may limit our ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or engage in other transactions, including using our common stock to make acquisitions and in connection with equity capital market transactions that might increase the value of our business.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, Oklahoma law and certain of the agreements into which we have entered as part of the separation may prevent or delay an acquisition of our company, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Oklahoma law contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the raider and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others:\n\u2022\na board of directors that is divided into three classes with staggered terms;\n\u2022\nrules regarding how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholder meetings;\n\u2022\nthe right of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval; and\n\u2022\nlimitations on the right of shareholders to remove directors.\nOklahoma law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15 percent or more of our outstanding common stock.\nWe believe these provisions protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise potentially unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make our company immune from takeovers. However, these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in the best interests of our company and our shareholders.\nOur ability to pay dividends on our common stock will depend on our ability to generate sufficient positive earnings and cash flows.\nOur ability to pay dividends in the future will depend upon, among other things, our future earnings, cash flows and restrictive covenants, if any, under future credit agreements to which we may be a party. Our cash available for dividends will principally be generated from our operations. Because the cash we generate from operations will fluctuate from quarter to quarter, we may not be able to maintain future dividends at the levels we expect or at all. Our ability to pay dividends depends primarily on cash flows, including cash flows from changes in working capital, and not solely on profitability, which is affected by noncash items. As a result, we may pay dividends during periods when we record net losses and may be unable to pay cash dividends during periods when we record net income.", "PERMNO": 14401, "SIC": 4924, "TIC": "OGS"}
