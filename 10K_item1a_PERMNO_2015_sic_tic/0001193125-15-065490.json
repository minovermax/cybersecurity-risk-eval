Risk Factors\nRISK FACTORS RELATING TO THE MERGER\nSusquehanna will be subject to business uncertainties while the Merger is pending, which could adversely affect its business.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Merger on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on Susquehanna, and, consequently, the surviving corporation. These uncertainties may impair Susquehanna\u2019s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Merger is consummated and for a period of time thereafter, and could cause customers and others that deal with Susquehanna to seek to change their existing business relationships with Susquehanna. Employee retention at Susquehanna may be particularly challenging during the pendency of the Merger, as employees may experience uncertainty about their roles with the surviving corporation following the Merger. In addition, the Merger Agreement restricts Susquehanna from making certain acquisitions and taking other specified actions without the consent of BB&T, and generally requires Susquehanna to continue its operations in the ordinary course, until the Merger closes. These restrictions may prevent Susquehanna from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the Merger. See the Proxy Statement/Prospectus for a description of the restrictive covenants to which Susquehanna is subject.\nThe Merger Agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the Merger may not be completed.\nThe Merger Agreement is subject to a number of conditions which must be fulfilled in order to complete the Merger. Those conditions include: the approval of the Merger proposal by Susquehanna shareholders, the receipt of all required regulatory approvals and expiration or termination of all statutory waiting periods in respect thereof, the accuracy of representations and warranties under the Merger Agreement (subject to the materiality standards set forth in the Merger Agreement), BB&T\u2019s and Susquehanna\u2019s performance of their respective obligations under the Merger Agreement in all material respects and each of BB&T\u2019s and Susquehanna\u2019s receipt of a tax opinion to the effect that the Merger will be treated as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. These conditions to the closing of the Merger may not be fulfilled in a timely manner or at all, and, accordingly, the Merger may be delayed or may not be completed.\nIn addition, if the Merger is not completed by November 11, 2015, either BB&T or Susquehanna may choose not to proceed with the Merger, and the parties can mutually decide to terminate the Merger Agreement at any time, before or after shareholder approval. In addition, BB&T and Susquehanna may elect to terminate the Merger Agreement in certain other circumstances. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, Susquehanna may be required to pay a termination fee of $85 million to BB&T. See the Proxy Statement/Prospectus for a further description of these circumstances.\nFailure to complete the Merger could negatively impact the stock price and the future business and financial results of Susquehanna.\nIf the Merger is not completed for any reason, including as a result of Susquehanna shareholders declining to approve the Merger Agreement, the ongoing business of Susquehanna may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the Merger, Susquehanna would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nSusquehanna may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on its stock price;\n\u2022\nSusquehanna may experience negative reactions from its customers, vendors and employees;\n\u2022\nSusquehanna will have incurred substantial expenses and will be required to pay certain costs relating to the Merger, whether or not the Merger is completed;\n\u2022\nthe Merger Agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of Susquehanna\u2019s businesses prior to completion of the Merger. Such restrictions, the waiver of which is subject to the consent of BB&T (not to be unreasonably withheld), may prevent Susquehanna from making certain acquisitions or taking certain other specified actions during the pendency of the Merger (see the Proxy Statement/Prospectus for a description of the restrictive covenants applicable to Susquehanna); and\n\u2022\nmatters relating to Merger (including integration planning) will require substantial commitments of time and resources by Susquehanna management, which would otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to Susquehanna as an independent company.\nIn addition to the above risks, if the Merger Agreement is terminated and Susquehanna\u2019s board of directors seeks another merger or business combination, Susquehanna shareholders cannot be certain that Susquehanna will be able to find a party willing to offer equivalent or more attractive consideration than the consideration BB&T has agreed to provide in the Merger. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, Susquehanna may be required to pay a termination fee of $85 million to BB&T. See the Proxy Statement/Prospectus for additional information.\nBecause the market price of BB&T common stock may fluctuate, shareholders cannot be certain of the precise value of the stock portion of the merger consideration they may receive in the Merger.\nAt the time the Merger is completed, each issued and outstanding share of Susquehanna common stock (other than shares held by Susquehanna or BB&T (with certain limited exceptions), shares held in treasury by Susquehanna and shares in respect to unvested Susquehanna restricted stock awards or restricted stock unit awards) will be converted into the right to receive consideration in the form of a combination of BB&T common stock and cash.\nThere will be a time lapse between each of the date of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the date on which Susquehanna shareholders vote to approve the Merger Agreement at the special meeting and the date on which Susquehanna shareholders entitled to receive shares of BB&T common stock actually receive such shares. The market value of BB&T common stock may fluctuate during these periods as a result of a variety of factors, including general market and economic conditions, changes in BB&T\u2019s businesses, operations and prospects, and regulatory considerations. Many of these factors are outside of the control of Susquehanna and BB&T. Consequently, at the time Susquehanna shareholders must decide whether to approve the Merger Agreement, they will not know the actual market value of the shares of BB&T common stock they will receive when the Merger is completed. The actual value of the shares of BB&T common stock received by Susquehanna shareholders will depend on the market value of shares of BB&T common stock on that date. This market value may be less or more than the value used to determine the Exchange Ratio.\nLitigation relating to the Merger could require us to incur significant costs and suffer management distraction, as well as delay and/or enjoin the Merger.\nNine individuals claiming to be shareholders of Susquehanna have made seven separate demands under Pennsylvania law on Susquehanna\u2019s board of directors, requesting the board to remedy alleged failures to engage in an independent and fair process in connection with the Merger. Eight of these individuals have filed six separate purported shareholder class action and derivative lawsuits challenging Susquehanna\u2019s pending merger with BB&T, and alleging, among other things, that Susquehanna\u2019s directors failed to fulfill their fiduciary duties with regard to the Merger. Certain of the complaints also allege that the preliminary Form S-4 filed by BB&T on December 15, 2014 provides inadequate and/or materially misleading information. The plaintiffs seek, among other things, injunctive relief to prevent the consummation of Susquehanna\u2019s merger with BB&T or, in the event the Merger is consummated, monetary damages. On December 30, 2014, Plaintiffs Wayne Waldeck and Linda and Wade Burkholder filed a motion seeking to consolidate their actions and any other related shareholder actions under the caption In re Susquehanna Bancshares, Inc. Stockholder Litigation, No. CI-14-10817 and to appoint interim co-lead plaintiffs\u2019 counsel. The Court granted that motion on January 26, 2015.\nOn February 25, 2015, the defendants entered into a memorandum of understanding with the plaintiffs in the demands and actions regarding the settlement of those demands and actions. Susquehanna, BB&T, and the other defendants deny all of the allegations made in the demands and the actions and believe the disclosures in the Proxy Statement are adequate under the law. Nevertheless, Susquehanna, BB&T, and the other defendants have agreed to settle those demands and actions in order to avoid the costs, disruption, and distraction of further litigation.\nSusquehanna and BB&T also could be subject to additional demands or litigation related to the Merger whether or not the Merger is consummated.\nFor additional information, refer to \u201cNote 15. Contingent Liabilities, Merger-Related Litigation\u201d to the consolidated financial statements.\nRISK FACTORS RELATING TO SUSQUEHANNA\u2019S OPERATIONS\nCurrent conditions in the capital markets and the economy continue to pose significant challenges and may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the capital markets and the economy generally, which continue to be uncertain and include sluggish economic growth, accompanied by high unemployment and historically low interest rates. In recent years, the economic downturn produced downward pressure on stock prices of, and credit availability to, certain companies without regard to those companies\u2019 underlying financial strength.\nIn recent years, concerns over unemployment, energy costs, the availability and cost of credit, the U.S. mortgage market, a depressed U.S. real estate market and geopolitical issues such as sovereign-debt defaults and euro-zone political uncertainty have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the capital and credit markets in the near term. Dramatic declines in the housing market in recent years, with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures and unemployment, resulted in significant write-downs of asset values by financial institutions. While conditions have improved, a return to a recessionary economy could result in financial stress on our borrowers that would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Deteriorating conditions in the regional economy we serve could drive losses beyond those provided for in our allowance for loan losses. The markets for fixed income instruments have experienced decreased liquidity, increased price volatility, credit downgrade events, and increased probability of default. Securities that are less liquid are more difficult to value and may be hard to dispose of. Domestic and international equity markets have also experienced periods of heightened volatility and turmoil, with issuers (such as Susquehanna) that have exposure to the real estate, mortgage, automobile and credit markets particularly affected. These events and other market disturbances may have an adverse effect on us, in part because we have a large investment portfolio and also because we are dependent upon customer behavior. Our revenues are susceptible to decline in such circumstances, and our profit margins could erode. In addition, in the event of extreme and prolonged market events, such as the global credit crisis, we could incur significant losses.\nFactors such as consumer spending, business investment, government spending, the volatility and strength of the capital markets, and inflation all affect the business and economic environment and, ultimately, the profitability of our business. In an economic downturn characterized by higher unemployment, lower family income, lower corporate earnings, lower business investment and lower consumer spending, the demand for our financial products could be adversely affected. Adverse changes in the economy could affect earnings negatively and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The economic slowdown has resulted in legislative and regulatory actions including the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act that has impacted our business and will further impact our business in the future. In addition, we cannot predict whether there will be additional legislative or regulatory actions, when such actions may occur or what impact, if any, such actions could have on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in interest rates may adversely affect our earnings and financial condition.\nOur net income depends primarily upon our net interest income. Net interest income is income that remains after deducting, from total income generated by earning assets, the interest expense attributable to the acquisition of the funds required to support earning assets. Income from earning assets includes income from loans, investment securities and short-term investments. The amount of interest income is dependent on many factors including the mix and volume of earning assets, the general level of interest rates, the dynamics of the change in interest rates, and the levels of nonperforming loans. The cost of funds varies with the amount of funds necessary to support earning assets, the rates paid to attract and hold deposits, rates paid on borrowed funds and the levels of non-interest-bearing demand deposits and equity capital.\nDifferent types of assets and liabilities may react differently, and at different times, to changes in market interest rates. We expect that we will periodically experience \u201cgaps\u201d in the interest rate sensitivities of our assets and liabilities. That means either our interest-bearing liabilities will be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than our interest-earning assets, or vice versa. When interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest-earning assets, an increase in market rates of interest could reduce our net interest income. Likewise, when interest-earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities, falling interest rates could reduce our net interest income. We are unable to predict changes in market interest rates, which are affected by many factors beyond our control, including inflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, domestic and international events, and changes in the United States and other financial markets.\nWe attempt to manage risk from changes in market interest rates, in part, by controlling the mix of interest- rate-sensitive assets and interest-rate-sensitive liabilities. However, interest-rate risk management techniques are not exact. A rapid increase or decrease in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial performance.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nOur ability to engage in funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and failure of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual funds, and other institutional clients. As a result, defaults by, or even questions or rumors about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to operational and credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us. Losses related to these credit risks could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or earnings.\nWe may be required to pay significantly higher Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation premiums in the future.\nFollowing the recent financial crisis, higher levels of bank failures have dramatically increased resolution costs of the FDIC and depleted the Deposit Insurance Fund (\u201cDIF\u201d). In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance to $250,000 per account, which placed additional stress on the DIF.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act broadened the base for FDIC deposit insurance assessments. Assessments are now based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution, rather than deposits. The legislation also increases the required minimum reserve ratio for the DIF from 1.15% to 1.35% of insured deposits, removes the statutory cap for the reserve ratio, leaving the FDIC with discretion to set this cap going forward, and directs the FDIC to offset the effects of increased assessments on depository institutions with less than $10 billion in assets. Recent FDIC regulations revise the risk-based assessment system for all large insured depository institutions (generally institutions with at least $10 billion in total assets, such as Susquehanna Bank). Under the regulations, the FDIC uses a scorecard method to calculate assessment rates for all such institutions.\nWe are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance. If additional bank or financial institution failures occur, we may be required to pay even higher FDIC premiums than the recently increased levels. Further, the FDIC may make material changes to the calculation of the prepaid assessment from the current proposal. Any future changes in the calculation or assessment of FDIC insurance premiums may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and our ability to continue to pay dividends on our common shares at the current rate or at all.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act and related legislation regarding the financial services industry could detrimentally affect our business.\nAs a publicly traded financial holding company, we are subject to various requirements and restrictions under the Dodd-Frank Act. See \u201cItem 1. Business- Supervision and Regulation\u201d above. The Dodd-Frank Act requires publicly traded companies to give shareholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and so-called \u201cgolden parachute\u201d payments and requires that listed companies implement and disclose \u201cclawback\u201d policies for recovery of incentive compensation paid to executive officers in connection with accounting restatements. The legislation also directs the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to bank holding company executives, regardless of whether the company is publicly traded or not.\nCompliance with such current and potential regulation and scrutiny may significantly increase our costs, impede the efficiency of our internal business processes, affect retention of key personnel, require us to increase our regulatory capital, require us to invest significant management attention and resources and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner.\nGovernment regulation significantly affects our business.\nApart from the Dodd-Frank Act, the banking industry is heavily regulated, and such regulations are intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the federal deposit insurance funds, not shareholders. See \u201cItem 1. Business- Supervision and Regulation.\u201d As a financial holding company, we are subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve Board. Our bank subsidiary is also regulated by the Federal Reserve Board and is subject to regulation by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and recently, by the CFPB as to consumer financial services and products. These regulations affect lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy, and growth. In addition, we have non-bank operating subsidiaries from which we derive income. Several of these non-bank subsidiaries engage in providing investment management and insurance brokerage services, industries that are also heavily regulated on both a state and federal level. In addition, newly enacted and amended laws, regulations, and regulatory practices affecting the financial service industry may result in higher capital requirements, higher insurance premiums and limit the manner in which we may conduct our business. Such changes may adversely affect us, including our ability to offer new products and services, obtain financing, attract deposits, make loans and leases and achieve satisfactory spreads, and may also result in the imposition of additional costs on us. As a public company, we are also subject to the corporate governance standards set forth in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as any applicable rules or regulations promulgated by the SEC and The NASDAQ Stock Market, LLC. Complying with these existing and any newly enacted standards, rules and regulations may impose administrative costs and burdens on us.\nGeographic concentration in one market may unfavorably impact our operations.\nSubstantially all of our business is with customers located within Pennsylvania, Maryland, and New Jersey, and our operations are heavily concentrated in the Mid-Atlantic region. As a result of this geographic concentration, our results depend largely on economic conditions in these and surrounding areas. Deterioration in economic conditions in this market could:\n\u2022\nincrease loan delinquencies;\n\u2022\nincrease problem assets and foreclosures;\n\u2022\nincrease claims and lawsuits;\n\u2022\ndecrease the demand for our products and services; and\n\u2022\ndecrease the value of collateral for loans, especially real estate, in turn reducing customers\u2019 borrowing power, the value of assets associated with nonperforming loans and collateral coverage.\nGenerally, we make loans to small to mid-sized businesses whose success depends on the regional economy. These businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities. Adverse economic and business conditions in our market area could reduce our growth rate, affect our borrowers\u2019 ability to repay their loans and, consequently, adversely affect our financial condition and performance. For example, we place substantial reliance on real estate as collateral for our loan portfolio. A sharp downturn in real estate values in our market area could leave many of our loans inadequately collateralized. If we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values, our earnings could be adversely affected.\nOur exposure to credit risk, which is heightened by our focus on commercial lending, could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition.\nThere are certain risks inherent in making loans. These risks include interest rate changes over the time period in which loans may be repaid, risks resulting from changes in the economy, risks inherent in dealing with borrowers and, in the case of a loan backed by collateral, risks resulting from uncertainties about the future value of the collateral.\nCommercial loans, including commercial real estate, are generally viewed as having a higher credit risk than residential real estate or consumer loans because they usually involve larger loan balances to a single borrower and are more susceptible to a risk of default during an economic downturn. Our consolidated commercial lending operations include commercial, financial and agricultural lending, real estate construction lending, and commercial mortgage lending, which comprised 18.0%, 5.8% and 29.5% of our total loan portfolio, respectively, as of December 31, 2014. Construction financing typically involves a higher degree of credit risk than commercial mortgage lending. Risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely on the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property\u2019s value at completion of construction compared to the estimated cost (including interest) of construction. If the estimated property value proves to be inaccurate, the loan may be inadequately collateralized.\nBecause our loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial real estate, commercial and industrial loans, and construction loans, the deterioration of these loans may cause a significant increase in nonperforming loans. An increase in nonperforming loans could cause an increase in loan charge-offs and a corresponding increase in the provision for loan losses, which could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in our accounting policies, as well as estimates we make, could materially affect how we report our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our financial condition and results of operations, and are based on current accounting rules. Certain of our accounting policies, as well as estimates we make, are \u201ccritical\u201d, as they are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations, and they require management to make particularly difficult, complex, or subjective judgments and estimates, often regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results could differ from our estimates and the use of different judgments and assumptions related to these policies and estimates could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. For a description of our critical accounting policies, refer to \u201cNote 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Part II, Item 8.\nFrom time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting guidance that governs the preparation of our financial statements. These changes are beyond our control, can be difficult to predict, and could materially impact how we report our financial condition and results of operations. We could be required to apply new or revised guidance retrospectively, which may result in the revision of prior financial statements by material amounts. The implementation of new or revised guidance could result in material adverse effects to our reported capital.\nIf our allowance for loan and lease losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan and lease losses, our earnings would decrease.\nTo absorb probable, incurred loan and lease losses that we may realize, we recognize an allowance for loan and lease losses based on, among other things, national and regional economic conditions, historical loss experience, and delinquency trends. However, we cannot estimate loan and lease losses with certainty, and we cannot assure you that charge-offs in future periods will not exceed the allowance for loan and lease losses. If charge-offs exceed our allowance, our earnings would decrease. In addition, regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, review our allowance for loan and lease losses and may require additions to the allowance based on their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examination. Factors that\nrequire an increase in our allowance for loan and lease losses, such as a prolonged economic downturn or continued weakening in general economic conditions such as inflation, recession, unemployment or other factors beyond our control, could reduce our earnings.\nOur controls and procedures could fail or be circumvented, and our pending acquisition by BB&T could elevate this risk.\nManagement regularly reviews and updates our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurances of the effectiveness of these systems and controls, and that the objectives of these controls have been met. Our pending acquisition by BB&T may heighten the risk of circumvention of our internal controls. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures, and any failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSusquehanna Bank could be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify mortgage loan purchasers due to breaches of representations and warranties, borrower fraud, or certain borrower defaults, which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nSusquehanna Bank is the successor to Graystone Tower Bank and its predecessor, the First National Bank of Chester County (\u201cFNBCC\u201d). FNBCC operated a significant amount of mortgage banking activities through its American Home Bank Division (\u201cAHB Division\u201d). When FNBCC or Graystone Tower Bank sold mortgage loans through this division, they were required to make customary representations and warranties to purchasers about the mortgage loans and the manner in which they were originated. The whole loan sale agreements assumed by Susquehanna Bank through the Tower merger require it to repurchase or substitute mortgage loans in the event there was a breach of any of these representations or warranties. In addition, Susquehanna Bank may be required to repurchase mortgage loans as a result of borrower fraud or in the event of early payment default of the borrower on a mortgage loan. Likewise, Susquehanna Bank is required to repurchase or substitute mortgage loans if it breaches a representation or warranty that was previously made in connection with a securitization. Although Susquehanna Bank may have remedies available against the originating broker or correspondent in these situations, those remedies may not be as broad as the remedies available to a purchaser of mortgage loans against Susquehanna Bank, and Susquehanna Bank faces further risk that the originating broker or correspondent may not have the financial capacity to perform remedies that otherwise may be available to it. Therefore, if a purchaser enforces its remedies, Susquehanna Bank may not be able to recover its losses from the originating broker or correspondent. If repurchase and indemnity demands increase significantly, our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nCompetition from other financial institutions in originating loans, attracting deposits and providing various financial services may adversely affect our profitability, and the announcement of our proposed acquisition by BB&T may intensify this competition.\nOur banking subsidiary faces substantial competition in originating loans, both commercial and consumer. This competition comes principally from other banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking companies, and other lenders. Many of our competitors enjoy advantages over Susquehanna, including greater financial resources and higher lending limits, a wider geographic presence, more accessible branch office locations, the ability to offer a wider array of services or more favorable pricing alternatives, as well as lower origination and operating costs. This competition could reduce our net income by decreasing the number and size of loans that our banking subsidiary originates and the interest rates it may charge on these loans.\nIn attracting business and consumer deposits, our bank subsidiary faces substantial competition from other insured depository institutions such as banks, savings institutions and credit unions, as well as institutions offering uninsured investment alternatives, including money market funds. Many of our competitors enjoy advantages over Susquehanna, including greater financial resources, more aggressive marketing campaigns and better brand recognition and more branch locations. These competitors may offer higher interest rates than we do, which could decrease the deposits that we attract or require us to increase our rates to retain existing deposits or attract new deposits. Increased deposit competition could adversely affect our ability to generate the funds necessary for lending operations. As a result, we may need to seek other sources of funds that may be more expensive to obtain and could increase our cost of funds.\nOur banking and non-banking subsidiaries also compete with non-bank providers of financial services, such as brokerage firms, consumer finance companies, credit unions, insurance companies and governmental organizations which may offer more favorable terms. Some of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern our banking operations. As a result, such non-bank competitors may have advantages over our banking and non-banking subsidiaries in providing certain products and services. This competition may reduce or limit our margins on banking and non-banking services, reduce our market share, and adversely affect our earnings and financial condition.\nWe also face the risk that our competitors also may seek to use the proposed BB&T merger to target our customers.\nWe continually encounter technological change, and we may have fewer resources than our competitors to continue to invest in technological improvements, which could reduce our ability to effectively compete.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introduction of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to better serving customers, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial service institutions to reduce costs. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services to enhance customer convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. There can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services, which could reduce our ability to effectively compete.\nUnauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or customer information, whether through a breach of our computer systems or otherwise, could severely harm our business.\nAs part of our business we collect, process, and retain sensitive and confidential client and customer information in both paper and electronic form. We have taken reasonable and prudent security measures to prevent the loss of this information, including steps to detect and deter cyber-related crimes intended to electronically infiltrate our network, capture sensitive client and customer information, deny service to customers via our website, and harm our electronic processing capability. Despite the security measures we have in place, our facilities and systems, and those of our third-party service providers, may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses or compromises, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, or other similar events. Any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer information, whether by us or by our vendors, could severely damage our reputation, expose us to the risks of litigation and liability, disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business and financial performance could be adversely affected, directly or indirectly, by disasters, by terrorist activities or by international hostilities.\nNeither the occurrence nor the potential impact of disasters, terrorist activities and international hostilities can be predicted. However, these occurrences could impact us directly as a result of damage to our facilities or by preventing us from conducting our business in the ordinary course, or indirectly as a result of their impact on our borrowers, the value of collateral, depositors, other customers, suppliers or other counterparties. We could also suffer adverse consequences to the extent that disasters, terrorist activities or international hostilities affect the financial markets or the economy in general or in any particular region. For example, a significant earthquake could impact us directly by disrupting our business operations or could lead to an increase in delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults that could result in our experiencing higher levels of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and provisions for credit losses.\nOur ability to mitigate the adverse consequences of such occurrences is in part dependent on the quality of our resiliency planning, and our ability, if any, to anticipate the nature of any such event that occurs. The adverse impact of disasters or terrorist activities or international hostilities also could be increased to the extent that there is a lack of preparedness on the part of national or regional emergency responders or on the part of other organizations and businesses that we deal with, particularly those that we depend upon but have no control over.\nNegative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely affect our earnings.\nReputational risk, or the risk to our earnings and capital from negative public opinion, is inherent in our business. Negative public opinion can result from the actual or perceived manner in which we conduct our business activities, including activities in our private and business banking operations and investment and trust operations; our management of actual or potential conflicts of interest and ethical issues; and our protection of confidential client information. Negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to keep and attract clients and can expose us to litigation and regulatory action. Although we take steps to minimize reputation risk in the way we conduct our business activities and deal with our clients, communities and vendors, these steps may not be effective.\nThe Pennsylvania business corporation law and various anti-takeover provisions under our articles of incorporation could impede the takeover of the company.\nVarious Pennsylvania laws affecting business corporations may have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire Susquehanna, even if the acquisition would be advantageous to shareholders. In addition, we have various anti-takeover measures in place under our articles of incorporation. Any one or more of these measures may impede the takeover of Susquehanna without the approval of our board of directors and may prevent our shareholders from taking part in a transaction in which they could realize a premium over the current market price of our common stock.\nWe have been and will likely continue to be involved in a variety of litigation arising out of our business operations.\nFrom time to time, we may be involved in a variety of litigation, claims or legal action arising out of our business operations. In recent years we have been the target of various lawsuits, ranging from ordinary disputes brought by counterparties with whom we have done business to suits brought by class action firms alleging business practices that are unfair to consumers.\nAny claims asserted, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, may harm our reputation and may cause us to incur significant expense. Our insurance coverage may not cover all claims that may be asserted against us. In addition, we may not be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance coverage in the future, nor may we be able to obtain adequate replacement policies with acceptable terms, if at all. Substantial legal liability could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may incur impairments to goodwill.\nAt December 31, 2014, we had approximately $1.3 billion recorded as goodwill. We evaluate goodwill for impairment, at least annually during the second quarter, of the fiscal year. Our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience, projections of future operating performance, and other market data points. In addition, management considered the value of consideration to be paid to shareholders upon completion of the merger with BB&T. Management determined there is no impairment of goodwill at year end. However, adverse fluctuations in the value of the consideration, as well as other factors that impact the fair value of our assets and liabilities such as interest rates, our annual assessment of goodwill could result in impairment to goodwill at one or more of our reporting units, triggering an impairment charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which such impairment is determined to exist. Any such change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and stock price.", "PERMNO": 73809, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "SUSQ"}
