{"cik": "1618756", "company": "Restaurant Brands International Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to our Business\nOur success depends on our ability to compete with our major competitors, many of which may have greater resources than we do.\nThe restaurant industry is intensely competitive and we compete in Canada, the United States and internationally with many well-established food service companies that compete on the basis of product choice, quality, affordability, service and location. Our competitors include a variety of independent local operators, in addition to well-capitalized regional, national and international restaurant chains and franchises. Furthermore, the restaurant industry has few barriers to entry, and therefore new competitors may emerge at any time.\nFor our Tim Hortons and Burger King brands, our principal competitors are McDonald\u2019s, Wendy\u2019s, Starbucks, Subway, Dunkin Donuts and Panera Bread as well as, in the case of our Burger King brand, regional hamburger restaurant chains, such as Carl\u2019s Jr., Jack in the Box and Sonic. To a lesser extent, our Tim Hortons and Burger King brands also compete for consumer dining dollars with national, regional and local (i) quick service restaurants that offer alternative menus, (ii) casual and \u201cfast casual\u201d restaurant chains, and (iii) convenience stores and grocery stores.\nOur ability to compete will depend on the success of our plans to improve existing products, to develop and roll-out new products and product line extensions, to effectively respond to consumer preferences and to manage the complexity of restaurant operations as well as the impact of our competitors\u2019 actions. Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources, higher revenues and greater economies of scale than we do. These advantages may allow them to (1) react to changes in pricing, marketing and the quick service restaurant segment in general more quickly and more effectively than we can, (2) rapidly expand new product introductions, (3) spend significantly more on advertising, marketing and other promotional activities than we do, which may give them a competitive advantage through higher levels of brand awareness among consumers and (4) devote greater resources to accelerate their restaurant remodeling efforts. Moreover, certain of our major competitors have completed the reimaging of a significant percentage of their store base. These competitive advantages arising from greater financial resources and economies of scale may be exacerbated in a difficult economy, thereby permitting our competitors to gain market share. If we are unable to maintain our competitive position, we could experience lower demand for products, downward pressure on prices, reduced margins, an inability to take advantage of new business opportunities, a loss of market share, reduced franchisee profitability and an inability to attract qualified franchisees in the future.\nOur success depends on the value of our brands and the failure to preserve their value and relevance, either through our actions or those of our franchisees and other partners, could have a negative impact on our financial results.\nWe depend in large part on the value of the Tim Hortons and Burger King brands. To be successful in the future, we must preserve, enhance and leverage the value of our brands. Brand value is based in part on consumer tastes, preferences and perceptions on a variety of factors, including the nutritional content and preparation of our food. Consumer acceptance of our products may be influenced or subject to change for a variety of reasons. For example, adverse publicity associated with nutritional, health and other scientific studies and conclusions, which constantly evolve and often have contradictory implications, may drive popular opinion against quick service restaurants in general, which may impact the demand for our products. In addition, adverse publicity related to litigation and regulation (including initiatives intended to drive consumer behavior) may impact the value of our brands by discouraging customers from buying our products.\nMoreover, health campaigns against products we offer in favor of foods that are perceived as healthier may affect consumer perception of our product offerings and impact the value of our brands. Perceptions may also be affected by activist campaigns to promote adverse perceptions of the quick service restaurant industry or our brands and/or our operations, suppliers, franchisees or other partners. If we are unsuccessful in addressing consumer adverse perceptions, our brands and our financial results may suffer.\nEconomic conditions have, and may continue to, adversely affect consumer discretionary spending which could negatively impact our business and operating results.\nWe believe that our sales, guest traffic and profitability are strongly correlated to consumer discretionary spending, which is influenced by general economic conditions, unemployment levels, the availability of discretionary income and, ultimately, consumer confidence. A protracted economic slowdown, increased unemployment and underemployment of our customer base, decreased salaries and wage rates, increased energy prices, inflation, foreclosures, rising interest rates or other industry-wide cost pressures adversely affect consumer behavior by weakening consumer confidence and decreasing consumer spending for restaurant dining occasions. As a result of these factors, during recessionary periods we may experience reduced revenues and sales deleverage, spreading fixed costs across a lower level of sales and causing downward pressure on our profitability and the profitability of our franchisees. These factors may also reduce sales at franchise restaurants, resulting in lower royalty payments from franchisees.\nOur substantial leverage and obligations to service our debt and preferred shares could adversely affect our business.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had aggregate outstanding indebtedness of $8,725.6 million, including a senior secured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $5,097.7 million, senior secured first lien notes in an aggregate principal amount of $1,250.0 million and senior secured second lien notes in an aggregate principal amount of $2,250.0 million. As of December 31, 2015, we also had outstanding 68.5 million Class A 9.0% cumulative compounding perpetual voting preferred shares entitling the holders thereof to receive cumulative cash dividends at an annual rate of 9.0% on the amount of the purchase price per preferred share, payable quarterly in arrears, and potentially to receive make-whole dividend payments. Subject to restrictions set forth in these instruments, we may also incur significant additional indebtedness in the future, some of which may be secured debt. This may have the effect of increasing our total leverage.\nOur substantial leverage could have important potential consequences, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of, and interest on, indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures, product research, dividends, share repurchases and development or other corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to, and limiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and the competitive environment and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to a downgrade of our credit rating, which could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity and access to capital markets;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to our competitors, to the extent that they are not as highly leveraged;\n\u2022\nrestricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022\nexposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as borrowings under our credit facilities are subject to variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to repay, refinance or satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional funds in the future and increasing the cost of any such borrowing; and\n\u2022\nexposing us to risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency as we earn profits in a variety of currencies around the world and substantially all of our debt is denominated in U.S. dollars.\nThere is no assurance that we will generate cash flow from operations or that future debt or equity financings will be available to us to enable us to pay our indebtedness or dividends on preferred shares or to fund other needs. As a result, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. There is no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all. Any inability to generate sufficient cash flow or refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWe are subject to restrictive debt covenants, which limit our ability to take certain actions and perform certain corporate functions.\nThe terms of our indebtedness include a number of restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness or guarantee indebtedness;\n\u2022\npay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of capital stock;\n\u2022\nmake investments or acquisitions;\n\u2022\ncreate liens or use assets as security in other transactions;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of substantially all of our or our subsidiaries\u2019 assets;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements restricting the ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany transactions;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nprepay certain kinds of indebtedness.\nWe cannot assure you that any of these limitations will not hinder our ability to finance future operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in our interest. In addition, our ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control.\nA breach of the covenants under our indebtedness could result in an event of default under the applicable agreement. Such a default could allow the holders of such indebtedness to accelerate the repayment of such debt and may result in the acceleration of the repayment of any other debt to which cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In addition, an event of default under our senior secured credit facilities would also permit the lenders thereunder to terminate all other commitments to extend additional credit under the senior secured credit facilities.\nFurthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due under our secured indebtedness, the holders of such indebtedness could proceed against the collateral that secures such indebtedness. In the event our creditors accelerate the repayment of our indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness.\nThe terms of our indebtedness and preferred shares are subject to mandatory redemption or repayment upon a change of control, and such terms could have the effect of delaying or preventing a future change of control.\nIn connection with any future change of control of the Company, subject to important exceptions contained in the instruments governing our indebtedness and preferred shares, (i) the terms of the credit agreement governing the senior secured term loan facility and the senior secured revolving credit facility will require repayment by the Company in the event of a change of control; (ii) the indenture governing the senior secured first lien and second lien notes will require the issuer thereof to make an offer to repurchase the notes in connection with a change of control; and (iii) the terms of the preferred shares will require, if requested by the holders of not less than a majority of the outstanding preferred shares, the preferred shares to be redeemed in full by the Company as a result of a change of control. In addition, other existing or future indebtedness of the Company may also be subject to mandatory repurchase or repayment upon a future change of control. Accordingly, a future change of control of the Company would require these and possibly other obligations to become subject to repurchase, repayment and/or redemption. In any such event, the Company may not have sufficient resources to repurchase, repay and redeem these obligations, as applicable. Moreover, if such financing is required to be repurchased, repaid or redeemed, other third-party financing may be required in order to provide the funds necessary for the Company to satisfy such obligations, and the Company may not be able to obtain such additional financing on terms favorable to it or at all.\nAny of these provisions may also discourage a potential acquirer from proposing or completing a transaction that may otherwise have presented a premium to the Company\u2019s shareholders.\nOur fully franchised business model presents a number of disadvantages and risks.\nSubstantially all Tim Hortons and Burger King restaurants are owned and operated by franchisees. Under our fully franchised business model, our future prospects depend on (1) our ability to attract new franchisees for both of our brands that meet our criteria and (2) the willingness of franchisees to open restaurants in existing and new markets. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify franchisees who meet our criteria, or if we identify such franchisees, that they will successfully implement their expansion plans.\nOur fully franchised business model presents a number of other drawbacks, such as limited influence over franchisees and reliance on franchisees to implement major initiatives, limited ability to facilitate changes in restaurant ownership, limitations on enforcement of franchise obligations due to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings and inability or unwillingness of franchisees to participate in our strategic initiatives.\nOur principal competitors that have a significantly higher percentage of company-operated restaurants than we do may have greater influence over their respective restaurant systems and greater ability to implement operational initiatives and business strategies, including their marketing and advertising programs.\nOur operating results are closely tied to the success of our franchisees; however, our franchisees are independent operators and we have limited influence over their restaurant operations.\nWe receive revenues in the form of royalties, fees and other amounts from our franchisees. As a result, our operating results are closely tied to the success of our franchisees. However, our franchisees are independent operators and we cannot control many factors\nthat impact the profitability of their restaurants. If sales trends or economic conditions worsen for franchisees, their financial results may deteriorate, which could result in, among other things, restaurant closures, delayed or reduced payments to us of royalties, advertising contributions, rents and, in the case of the Tim Hortons brand, delayed or reduced payments for products and supplies, and an inability for such franchisees to obtain financing to fund development, restaurant remodels or equipment initiatives on acceptable terms or at all. Furthermore, franchisees may not be willing or able to renew their franchise agreements with us due to low sales volumes, or high real estate costs, or may be unable to renew due to the failure to secure lease renewals. If our franchisees fail to renew their franchise agreements, our royalty revenues may decrease which in turn could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nA franchisee bankruptcy could have a substantial negative impact on our ability to collect payments due under such franchisee\u2019s franchise agreements and, if applicable, lease agreements with us. In a Canadian or U.S. franchisee bankruptcy, the debtor in possession or bankruptcy trustee may reject its franchise arrangements under applicable bankruptcy law, in which case there would be no further royalty payments, rent payments or, in the case of the Tim Hortons brand, payments for products and supplies from such franchisee, and there can be no assurance as to the proceeds, if any, that may ultimately be recovered in a bankruptcy proceeding of such franchisee in connection with a damage claim resulting from such rejection.\nUnder our franchise agreements, we can, among other things, mandate menu items, signage, equipment, hours of operation and value menu, establish operating procedures and approve suppliers, distributors and products. However, the quality of franchise restaurant operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control. Consequently, franchisees may not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements or standards set by applicable law. In addition, franchisees may not hire and train qualified managers and other restaurant personnel. Any operational shortcoming of a Tim Hortons or Burger King franchise restaurant is likely to be attributed by guests to the entire brand, thus damaging the brand\u2019s reputation and potentially affecting our revenues and profitability. While we ultimately can take action to terminate franchisees that do not comply with the standards contained in our franchise agreements and our operating standards, we may not be able to identify problems and take action quickly enough and, as a result, our image and reputation may suffer, and our franchise revenues and results of operations could decline.\nOur operating results could be impacted by changes in consumer behavior that are the result of advances in technologies and alternative delivery methods.\nIf the behavior or preferences of our guests change as a result of advances in technologies or alternative delivery methods or channels and we are not able to respond to these changes, or our competitors respond to these changes more effectively, then our business and operating results could be materially harmed.\nOur operating results depend on the effectiveness of our marketing and advertising programs and the successful development and launch of new products.\nOur revenues are heavily influenced by brand marketing and advertising and by our ability to develop and launch new and innovative products and product extensions. Our marketing and advertising programs may not be successful or we may fail to develop commercially successful new products, which may lead us to fail to attract new guests and retain existing guests. If our marketing and advertising programs are unsuccessful or if we fail to develop commercially successful new products, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Moreover, because franchisees contribute to our advertising fund based on a percentage of gross sales at their franchise restaurants, our advertising fund expenditures are dependent upon sales volumes at system-wide restaurants. If system-wide sales decline, there will be a reduced amount available for our marketing and advertising programs. In addition, we have emphasized certain value offerings in our marketing and advertising programs to drive traffic at our stores. The disadvantage of value offerings is that the low-price offerings may condition our guests to resist higher prices in a more favorable economic environment.\nFranchisee support for our marketing and advertising programs is critical for our long-term success.\nThe support of our franchisees is critical for the success of our marketing and advertising programs and any new capital intensive or other strategic initiatives that we seek to undertake, and the successful execution of these initiatives will depend on our ability to maintain alignment with our franchisees. While we can mandate certain strategic initiatives through enforcement of our franchise agreements, we will need the active support of our franchisees if the implementation of these initiatives is to be successful. In addition, efforts to build alignment with franchisees may result in a delay in the implementation of planned marketing and advertising programs and other key initiatives. Franchisees may not continue to support our marketing programs and strategic initiatives. The failure of these franchisees to support our marketing programs and strategic initiatives could adversely affect our ability to implement our business strategy and could materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe success of our Tim Hortons brand depends substantially on the performance of our Canadian business.\nThe financial performance of our Tim Hortons brand is highly dependent on the performance of the restaurants in Canada, which accounted for the substantial majority of its revenues and operating income in 2015. Accordingly, any substantial or sustained decline in Tim Hortons Canadian business or the value of the Canadian dollar would materially and adversely affect our financial results.\nOur future growth and profitability will depend on our ability to successfully accelerate international development with strategic partners and joint ventures.\nWe believe that the future growth and profitability of both of our brands will depend on our ability to successfully accelerate international development with strategic partners and joint ventures in new and existing international markets. New markets may have different competitive conditions, consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets. As a result, new restaurants in those markets may have lower average restaurant sales than restaurants in existing markets and may take longer than expected to reach target sales and profit levels (or may never do so). We will need to build brand awareness in those new markets we enter through advertising and promotional activity, and those activities may not promote our brands as effectively as intended, if at all.\nFor the past several years, Burger King Worldwide has used a master franchise development model, which in markets with strong growth potential may include participating in strategic joint ventures with little to no upfront investment, to accelerate international growth. We plan to use a similar strategy with the Tim Hortons brand to grow the brand\u2019s presence globally through partnerships with local restaurant operators or local entrepreneurs as franchisees. These new arrangements may give our joint venture and/or master franchise partners the exclusive right to develop and manage our restaurants in a specific country or countries. A joint venture partnership involves special risks, such as our joint venture partners may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with those of the joint venture or us, or our joint venture partners may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone. Our master franchise arrangements present similar risks and uncertainties. We cannot control the actions of our joint venture partners or master franchisees, including any nonperformance, default or bankruptcy of joint venture partners or master franchisees. In addition, the termination of an arrangement with a master franchisee or a lack of expansion by certain master franchisees could result in the delay or discontinuation of the development of franchise restaurants, or an interruption in the operation of our brand in a particular market or markets. We may not be able to find another operator to resume development activities in such market or markets. Any such delay, discontinuation or interruption could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWhile we believe that our joint venture and master franchise arrangements provide us with experienced local business partners in foreign countries, events or issues, including disagreements with our partners, may occur that require attention of our senior executives and may result in expenses or losses that erode the profitability of our international operations.\nIn addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act (Canada) and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these laws. Despite our compliance programs, we cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from reckless or negligent acts committed by our strategic partners and joint venturers or their employees or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, may have a negative effect on our results of operations, financial condition and reputation.\nIf we are unable to effectively manage our growth, it could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nAs a result of the Transactions, we became the indirect holding company for Tim Hortons and Burger King Worldwide and their respective consolidated subsidiaries with over 19,000 restaurants. In addition, as described elsewhere in this report, our growth strategy includes strategic expansion in existing and new markets, and contemplates a significant acceleration in the growth in the number of new restaurants. As our franchisees are independent third parties, we have and may need to continue to expend substantial financial and managerial resources to enhance our existing restaurant management systems, financial and management controls, information systems and personnel to accurately capture and reflect the financial and operational activities at our franchise restaurants. On occasion we have encountered, and may in the future encounter, challenges in receiving these results from our franchisees in a consistent and timely manner. If we are not able to effectively manage the management and information demands associated with the significant growth of our franchise system, then our business and operating results could be negatively impacted.\nSub-franchisees could take actions that could harm our business and that of our master franchisees.\nOur business model contemplates us entering into agreements with master franchisees and other partners that permit them to develop and operate restaurants in defined geographic areas. As permitted by certain of these agreements, master franchisees or partners may elect to sub-franchise rights to develop and operate Burger King or Tim Hortons restaurants, as applicable in the geographic area covered by the agreement. These agreements contractually obligate our master franchisees or partners, as applicable, to operate their restaurants in accordance with specified operations, safety and health standards and also require that any sub-franchise agreement contain similar requirements. However, we are not party to the agreements with the sub-franchisees and, as a result, are dependent upon our master franchisees and partners to enforce these standards with respect to sub-franchised restaurants. As a result, the ultimate success and quality of any sub-franchised restaurant rests with the master franchisee or partner and the sub-franchisee. If sub-franchisees do not successfully operate their restaurants in a manner consistent with required standards, franchise fees and royalty income ultimately paid to us could be adversely affected, and our brand image and reputation may be harmed, which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur international operations subject us to additional risks and costs and may cause our profitability to decline.\nOur operations outside of the U.S. and Canada are exposed to risks inherent in foreign operations. These risks, which can vary substantially by market, are described in many of the risk factors discussed in this section and include the following:\n\u2022\ngovernmental laws, regulations and policies adopted to manage national economic conditions, such as increases in taxes, austerity measures that impact consumer spending, monetary policies that may impact inflation rates and currency fluctuations;\n\u2022\nthe risk of markets in which we have granted exclusive development and subfranchising rights;\n\u2022\nthe effects of legal and regulatory changes and the burdens and costs of our compliance with a variety of foreign laws;\n\u2022\nchanges in the laws and policies that govern foreign investment and trade in the countries in which we operate;\n\u2022\nrisks and costs associated with political and economic instability, corruption, anti-American sentiment and social and ethnic unrest in the countries in which we operate;\n\u2022\nthe risks of operating in developing or emerging markets in which there are significant uncertainties regarding the interpretation, application and enforceability of laws and regulations and the enforceability of contract rights and intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nrisks arising from the significant and rapid fluctuations in currency exchange markets and the decisions and positions that we take to hedge such volatility;\n\u2022\nchanging labor conditions and difficulties experienced by our franchisees in staffing their international operations;\n\u2022\nthe impact of labor costs on our franchisees\u2019 margins given our labor-intensive business model and the long-term trend toward higher wages in both mature and developing markets and the potential impact of union organizing efforts on day-to-day operations of our franchisees\u2019 restaurants; and\n\u2022\nthe effects of increases in the taxes we pay and other changes in applicable tax laws.\nThese factors may increase in importance as we expect franchisees of both of our brands to open new restaurants in international markets as part of our growth strategy.\nOur operations are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates.\nWe report our results in U.S. dollars, which is our reporting currency. The operations of each of TH and BK that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and changes in currency regulations. The majority of TH\u2019s operations, income, revenues, expenses and cash flows are denominated in Canadian dollars, which we translate to U.S. dollars for our financial reporting purposes. Royalty payments from BK franchisees in our European markets and in certain other countries are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Furthermore, franchise royalties from each of TH\u2019s and BK\u2019s international franchisees are calculated based on local currency sales; consequently, franchise revenues are still impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Revenues and expenses of TH and BK that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated using the average rates during the period in which they are recognized and are impacted by changes in currency exchange rates.\nWe enter into forward contracts to reduce our exposure to volatility from foreign currency fluctuations associated with certain foreign currency-denominated assets. However, for a variety of reasons, we do not hedge our revenue exposure in other currencies. Therefore, we are exposed to volatility in those other currencies, and this volatility may differ from period to period. As a result, the foreign currency impact on our operating results for one period may not be indicative of future results. We also use forward currency contracts to manage the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on U.S. dollar purchases and payments, such as coffee and certain intercompany purchases, made by our TH Canadian operations.\nFluctuations in interest rates may also affect our combined business. We attempt to minimize this risk and lower overall borrowing costs through the utilization of derivative financial instruments. We primarily utilize interest rate swaps to attempt to minimize this risk and lower our overall borrowing costs. These instruments are entered into with financial institutions and have reset dates and critical terms that match those of our forecasted interest payments. Accordingly, any changes in interest rates we pay are partially offset by changes in the market value associated with derivative financial instruments.\nAs a result of entering into these hedging contracts with major financial institutions, we may be subject to counterparty nonperformance risk. Should there be a counterparty default, we could be exposed to the net losses on the hedged arrangements or be unable to recover anticipated net gains from the transactions.\nIncreases in food and commodity costs could harm our operating results and the results of our franchisees.\nOur profitability and the profitability of our franchisees will depend in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food and commodity and supply costs. With respect to our TH business, volatility in connection with certain key commodities that we purchase in the ordinary course of business, such as coffee, wheat, edible oils and sugar, can impact our revenues, costs and margins.\nIf commodity prices rise, franchisees may experience reduced sales due to decreased consumer demand at retail prices that have been raised to offset increased commodity prices, which may reduce franchisee profitability. In addition, with respect to our BK business, the market for beef and chicken is particularly volatile and is subject to significant price fluctuations due to seasonal shifts, climate conditions, demand for corn (a key ingredient of cattle and chicken feed), corn ethanol policy, industry demand, international commodity markets, food safety concerns, product recalls, government regulation and other factors, all of which are beyond its control and, in many instances unpredictable. If the price of beef, chicken or other products that we use in our Company restaurants increases in the future and we choose not to pass, or cannot pass, these increases on to our guests, our operating margins would decrease for as long as we operate Company restaurants. Any such decline in franchisee sales will reduce our royalty income, which in turn may materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nIf the supply or quality of food or commodities fails to meet demand or the quality standards of our guests, our franchisees may experience reduced sales which, in turn, would reduce rents and royalty revenues as well as supply chain sales. Such a reduction in rents and royalty revenues and supply chain sales may adversely impact our business and financial results.\nOur vertically integrated supply chain operations, including manufacturing, warehouse and distribution activities, subject us to additional risks and may cause our profitability to decline.\nWe operate a vertically integrated supply chain for our TH business in which we manufacture, warehouse, and distribute certain food and restaurant supplies to our franchise and Company restaurants. There are certain risks associated with this vertical integration growth strategy, including:\n\u2022\ndelays and/or difficulties associated with owning a manufacturing, warehouse and distribution business;\n\u2022\nmaintenance, operations and/or management of the facilities, equipment, employees and inventories;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the flexibility of controlling capital expenditures and overhead;\n\u2022\nthe need for skills and techniques that are outside our traditional core expertise;\n\u2022\nincreased transportation, shipping, food and other supply costs;\n\u2022\ninclement weather or extreme weather events;\n\u2022\nshortages or interruptions in the availability or supply of high-quality coffee beans, perishable food products and/or their ingredients;\n\u2022\nvariations in the quality of food and beverage products and/or their ingredients; and\n\u2022\npolitical, physical, environmental, labor, or technological disruptions in our or our suppliers\u2019 manufacturing and/or warehousing plants, facilities, or equipment.\nIf we do not adequately address the challenges related to these vertically integrated operations or the overall level of utilization or production decreases for any reason, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely impacted. Moreover, shortages or interruptions in the availability and delivery of food, beverages and other suppliers to our restaurants may increase costs or reduce revenues.\nOur success is dependent on securing desirable restaurant locations for both of our brands, and competition for these locations may impact our ability to effectively grow our restaurant portfolios.\nThe success of any restaurant depends in substantial part on its location. There can be no assurance that the current locations of our restaurants will continue to be attractive as demographic patterns change. Neighborhood or economic conditions where restaurants are located could decline in the future, thus resulting in potentially reduced sales in those locations. Competition for restaurant locations can also be intense and there may be delay or cancellation of new site developments by developers and landlords, which may be exacerbated by factors related to the commercial real estate or credit markets. If franchisees cannot obtain desirable locations for their restaurants at reasonable prices due to, among other things, higher than anticipated acquisition, construction and/or development costs of new restaurants; difficulty negotiating leases with acceptable terms; onerous land use or zoning restrictions; or challenges in securing required governmental permits; then their ability to execute their respective growth strategies may be adversely affected.\nThe market for retail real estate is highly competitive. Based on their size advantage and/or their greater financial resources, some of our competitors may have the ability to negotiate more favorable lease terms than we can and some landlords and developers may offer priority or grant exclusivity to some of our competitors for desirable locations. As a result, we or our franchisees may not be able to obtain new leases or renew existing leases on acceptable terms, if at all, which could adversely affect our sales and brand-building initiatives.\nOur ownership and leasing of significant amounts of real estate exposes us to possible liabilities, losses, and risks.\nMany of our system restaurants are presently located on leased premises. As leases underlying our Company and franchise restaurants expire, we or our franchisees may be unable to negotiate a new lease or lease extension, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us or our franchisees to close restaurants in desirable locations. As a result, our sales and our brand building initiatives could be adversely affected. Furthermore, we cannot cancel existing leases; therefore, if an existing or future restaurant is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term. In addition, the value of our owned real estate assets could decrease, and/or our costs could increase, because of changes in the investment climate for real estate, demographic trends, demand for restaurant sites and other retail properties, and exposure to or liability associated with environmental contamination and reclamation.\nTypically the costs of insurance, taxes, maintenance, utilities, and other property-related costs due under a prime lease with a third-party landlord are passed through to the franchisee under our sublease. If a franchisee fails to perform the obligations passed through under the sublease, we will be required to perform these obligations resulting in an increase in our leasing and operational costs and expenses. In addition, the rent a franchisee pays us under the sublease is generally based on a percentage of gross sales. If gross sales at a certain restaurant are less than we project we may pay more rent to a third-party landlord under the prime lease than we receive from the franchisee under the sublease. These events could result in an inability to fully recover from the franchisee expenses incurred on leased properties, resulting in increased leasing and operational costs to us.\nIf we fail to successfully implement our store image and renovation initiatives, our ability to increase revenues and our profitability may be adversely affected.\nOur restaurant reimaging initiatives depend on the ability and willingness of franchisees to remodel their existing restaurants. Even if they are willing to remodel their restaurants, many of our franchisees will need to borrow funds in order to finance these capital expenditures. If our franchisees are unable to obtain financing at commercially reasonable rates, or not at all, they may be unwilling or unable to invest in the reimaging of their existing restaurants, and our future growth could be adversely affected.\nFood safety and food-borne illness concerns may have an adverse effect on our business.\nFood safety is a top priority for us and we dedicate substantial resources to ensure that our customers enjoy safe, high-quality food products. However, food-borne illnesses, such as E. coli, salmonella, and other food safety issues have occurred in the food industry in the past and could occur in the future. Furthermore, our reliance on third-party food suppliers and distributors increases the risk that food-borne illness incidents could be caused by factors outside of our control and that multiple locations would be affected rather than a single restaurant. New illnesses resistant to any precautions may develop in the future, or diseases with long incubation periods could arise, such as mad cow disease, which could give rise to claims or allegations on a retroactive basis. Any report or publicity, including through social media, linking us or one of our franchisees or suppliers to instances of food-borne illness or other food safety issues, including food tampering, adulteration or contamination, could adversely affect our brands and reputation as well as our revenues and profits. Outbreaks of disease, as well as influenza, could reduce traffic in our stores. If our customers become ill from food-borne illnesses, we could also be forced to temporarily close some restaurants. In addition, instances of food-borne illness, food tampering or food contamination occurring solely at restaurants of competitors could adversely affect our sales as a result of negative publicity about the foodservice industry generally.\nThe occurrence of food-borne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients, which could result in disruptions in our supply chain, significantly increase our costs and/or lower margins for us and our franchisees. In addition, our industry has long been subject to the threat of food tampering by suppliers, employees or guests, such as the addition of foreign objects in the food that we sell. Reports, whether or not true, of injuries caused by food tampering have in the past severely injured the reputations of restaurant chains in the quick service restaurant segment and could affect us in the future as well. Furthermore, increased use of social media may strengthen the effects of any such negative publicity.\nOur results can be adversely affected by unforeseen events, such as adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, terrorist attacks or threats or catastrophic events.\nUnforeseen events, such as adverse weather conditions, natural disasters or catastrophic events, can adversely impact our restaurant sales. Natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, and severe adverse weather conditions and health pandemics whether occurring in Canada, the United States or abroad, can keep customers in the affected area from dining out and result in lost opportunities for our restaurants. Furthermore, we cannot predict the effects that actual or threatened armed conflicts, terrorist attacks, efforts to combat terrorism or heightened security requirements will have on our future operations. Because a significant portion of our restaurant operating costs is fixed or semi-fixed in nature, the loss of sales during these periods hurts our operating margins and can result in restaurant operating losses.\nThe loss of key management personnel or our inability to attract and retain new qualified personnel could hurt our business and inhibit our ability to operate and grow successfully.\nWe are dependent on the efforts and abilities of our senior management, including the executives managing both of our brands, and our success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain additional qualified employees. Failure to attract personnel sufficiently qualified to execute our strategy, or to retain existing key personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nChanges in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect the taxes we pay and our profitability.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in Canada, the United States, and numerous foreign jurisdictions. A taxation authority may disagree with certain of our collective views, including, for example, the allocation of profits by tax jurisdiction, and the deductibility of our interest expense, and may take the position that material income tax liabilities, interests, penalties, or other amounts are payable by us, in which case, we expect to contest such assessment. Contesting such an assessment may be lengthy and costly and if we were unsuccessful, the implications could be materially adverse to us and affect our effective tax rate or operating income.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to additional state and local income tax audits, international income tax audits and sales, franchise and value-added-tax tax audits. Our effective income tax rate and tax payments in the future could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including: changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates; changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities; continued losses in certain international markets that could trigger a valuation allowance; changes in tax laws; the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions around the world; taxes imposed upon sales of Company restaurants to franchisees; and any repatriation of earnings or our determination that unremitted earnings from foreign subsidiaries for which we have not previously provided for taxes were no longer permanently reinvested.\nAlthough we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. There can be no assurance that the Canada Revenue Agency (the \u201cCRA\u201d), the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) and/or foreign tax authorities will agree with our interpretation of the tax aspects of reorganizations, initiatives, transactions, or any related matters associated therewith that we have undertaken.\nThe results of a tax audit or related litigation could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income (loss) or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made. The CRA or the IRS may take the position that material Canadian or U.S. federal income tax liabilities, interest and penalties, respectively, are payable or that our tax positions or views are invalid. If we are unsuccessful in disputing the CRA\u2019s or the IRS\u2019 assertions, we may not be in a position to take advantage of the effective tax rates and the level of benefits that we anticipated to achieve as a result of corporate reorganizations, initiatives and transactions, and the implications could be materially adverse to us, including an increase in our effective tax rate. Even if we are successful in maintaining our positions, we may incur significant expense in contesting positions asserted or claims made by tax authorities that could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nThe Company and Partnership may be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which could subject us and Partnership to substantial additional U.S. taxes.\nAs Canadian entities, the Company and Partnership generally would be classified as foreign entities (and, therefore, non-U.S. tax residents) under general rules of U.S. federal income taxation. Section 7874 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), however, contains rules that result in a non-U.S. corporation being taxed as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, unless certain tests, applied at the time of the acquisition, regarding ownership of such entities (as relevant here, ownership by former Burger King Worldwide shareholders) or level of business activities (as relevant here, business activities in Canada by us and our affiliates, including Partnership), were satisfied at such time. The U.S. Treasury Regulations apply these same rules to non-U.S. publicly traded partnerships, such as Partnership. These statutory and regulatory rules are relatively new, their application is complex and there is little guidance regarding their application.\nIf it were determined that we and/or Partnership should be taxed as U.S. corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we and Partnership could be liable for substantial additional U.S. federal income tax. For Canadian tax purposes, we and Partnership are expected, regardless of any application of Section 7874 of the Code, to be treated as a Canadian resident company and partnership, respectively. Consequently, if we and/or Partnership did not satisfy either of the applicable tests, we might be liable for both Canadian and U.S. taxes, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFuture changes to U.S. and non-U.S. tax laws could materially affect the Company and/or Partnership, including their status as foreign entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and adversely affect their anticipated financial positions and results.\nChanges to the rules in section 7874 of the Code or the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, or other changes in law, could adversely affect our and/or Partnership\u2019s status as a non-U.S. entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, our effective tax rate\nor future planning based on current law, and any such changes could have prospective or retroactive application to us and/or Partnership. For example, recent legislative proposals have aimed to expand the scope of section 7874 of the Code, or otherwise address certain perceived issues arising in connection with so-called inversion transactions. It is presently uncertain whether any such legislative proposals will be enacted into law and, if so, what impact such legislation would have on us. In addition, the U.S. Treasury has indicated that it is considering possible regulatory action in connection with so-called inversion transactions, including, most recently, in Notices 2015-79 and 2014-52. The timing and substance of any such action is presently uncertain. Any such change of law or regulatory action which could apply retroactively or prospectively, could adversely impact our tax position as well as our financial position and results in a material manner. The precise scope and application of the regulatory proposals will not be clear until proposed Treasury Regulations are actually issued, and, accordingly, until such regulations are promulgated and fully understood, we cannot be certain that there will be no such impact.\nMoreover, the U.S. Congress, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and other government agencies in jurisdictions where the Company and its affiliates do business have had an extended focus on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations. In particular, specific attention has been paid to \u201cbase erosion and profit shifting\u201d, where payments are made between affiliates from a jurisdiction with high tax rates to a jurisdiction with lower tax rates. As a result, the tax laws in the U.S. and other countries in which we do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis, and any such change could adversely affect us.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could harm the value of our brand and branded products and adversely affect our business.\nWe depend in large part on the value of the Tim Hortons and Burger King brands, which represent 44.9% of the total assets on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. We believe that our brands are very important to our success and our competitive position. We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, patents and other intellectual property rights to protect our brands and the respective branded products. The success of our business depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both domestic and international markets. We have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the United States, Canada and foreign jurisdictions. Not all of the trademarks that our brands currently use have been registered in all of the countries in which we do business, and they may never be registered in all of these countries. We may not be able to adequately protect our trademarks, and our use of these trademarks may result in liability for trademark infringement, trademark dilution or unfair competition. The steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in Canada, the United States and in foreign countries may not be adequate and our proprietary rights could be challenged, circumvented, infringed or invalidated. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of Canada and the United States.\nWe may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing on our intellectual property rights, and we may, from time to time, be required to institute litigation to enforce our trademarks or other intellectual property rights or to protect our trade secrets. Further, third parties may assert or prosecute infringement claims against us and we may or may not be able to successfully defend these claims. Any such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could negatively affect our revenue, profitability and prospects regardless of whether we are able to successfully enforce our rights.\nWe have been, and in the future may be, subject to litigation that could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe may from time to time, in the ordinary course of business, be subject to litigation relating to matters including, but not limited to, disputes with franchisees, suppliers, employees and customers, as well as disputes over our intellectual property. Some of these claims are incidental to our business, such as \u201cslip and fall\u201d accidents at franchise or company-operated restaurants, claims and disputes in connection with site development and construction of system restaurants and employment claims.\nWhether or not any claims against us are valid, or whether we are ultimately held liable, such litigation may be expensive to defend, harm our reputation and divert resources away from our operations and negatively impact our reported earnings. Furthermore, legal proceedings against a franchisee or its affiliates by third parties, whether in the ordinary course of business or otherwise, may include claims against us by virtue of our relationship with the franchisee.\nFurthermore, in certain of our agreements, we may agree to indemnify our business partners against any losses or costs incurred in connection with claims by a third party alleging that our services infringe the intellectual property rights of the third-party. Companies have increasingly become subject to infringement threats from non-practicing organizations filing lawsuits for patent infringement. We, or our business partners, may become subject to claims for infringement and we may be required to indemnify or defend our business partners from such claims. We are also exposed to a wide variety of falsified or exaggerated claims due to our size and brand recognition. All of these types of matters have the potential to unduly distract management\u2019s attention and increase costs, including costs associated with defending such claims. Our current exposure with respect to legal matters pending against us could change if determinations by judges and other finders of fact are not in accordance with management\u2019s evaluation of the claims. Should\nmanagement\u2019s evaluations prove incorrect and such claims are successful, our exposure could exceed expectations and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although some losses may be covered by insurance, if there are significant losses that are not covered, or there is a delay in receiving insurance proceeds, or the proceeds are insufficient to offset our losses fully, our consolidated financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.\nPublic and private concerns about the health risks associated with fast food may adversely affect our financial results.\nClass action lawsuits have been filed, and may continue to be filed, against various quick service restaurants alleging, among other things, that quick service restaurants have failed to disclose the health risks associated with high-fat or high-sodium foods and that quick service restaurant marketing practices have targeted children and encouraged obesity. Adverse publicity about these allegations may negatively affect us and our franchisees, regardless of whether the allegations are true, by discouraging customers from buying our products. In addition, we face the risk of lawsuits and negative publicity resulting from illnesses and injuries, including injuries to infants and children, allegedly caused by our products, toys and other promotional items available in our restaurants or our playground equipment. In addition to decreasing our revenue and profitability and diverting our management resources, adverse publicity or a substantial judgment against us could negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and brand reputation, hindering our ability to attract and retain franchisees and grow our business in Canada, the United States and internationally.\nChanges in regulations may adversely affect restaurant operations and our financial results.\nOur franchise and Company restaurants are subject to licensing and regulation by health, sanitation, safety and other agencies in the state, province and/or municipality in which the restaurant is located. Federal, state, provincial and local government authorities may enact laws, rules or regulations that impact restaurant operations and the cost of conducting those operations. In many of our markets, including Canada, the United States and Europe, we and our franchisees are subject to increasing regulation regarding our operations which may significantly increase the cost of doing business. In developing markets, we face the risks associated with new and untested laws and judicial systems. Among the more important regulatory risks regarding our operations are the following:\n\u2022\nthe impact of the Fair Labor Standards Act, and similar Canadian legislation, which governs such matters as minimum wage, overtime and other working conditions, family leave mandates and a variety of other laws enacted that govern these and other employment matters;\n\u2022\nthe risk of franchisors being considered a joint employer with franchisees;\n\u2022\nthe impact of changes in employment eligibility requirements, the cessation or limitation of access to federal, state or provincial labor programs, including amendments to the Temporary Foreign Worker Program of the Federal Government of Canada;\n\u2022\nthe impact of immigration and other local and foreign laws and regulations on our business;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in our operations or price volatility in a market that can result from governmental actions, including price controls, currency and repatriation controls, limitations on the import or export of commodities we use or government-mandated closure of our or our vendors\u2019 operations;\n\u2022\nthe impact of the United States federal menu labeling law, and similar Canadian legislation, which requires the listing of specified nutritional information on menus and menu boards on consumer demand for our products;\n\u2022\nthe risks of operating in foreign markets in which there are significant uncertainties, including with respect to the application of legal requirements and the enforceability of laws and contractual obligations;\n\u2022\nthe impact of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act on the businesses of our U.S. franchisees, many of whom are small business owners who may have significant difficulty absorbing the increased costs or may need to revise the ways in which they conduct their business; and\n\u2022\nthe impact of costs of compliance with privacy, consumer protection and other laws, the impact of costs resulting from consumer fraud and the impact on our margins as the use of cashless payments increases.\nWe are subject to various provincial, state and foreign laws that govern the offer and sale of a franchise, including in the U.S., to a Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) rule. Various state and foreign laws regulate certain aspects of the franchise relationship, including terminations and the refusal to renew franchises. The failure to comply with these laws and regulations in any jurisdiction or to obtain required government approvals could result in a ban or temporary suspension on future franchise sales, fines and penalties or require us to make offers of rescission or restitution, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. We could also face lawsuits by franchisees based upon alleged violations of these laws.\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d), and similar Canadian legislation, prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations and employment. We have, in the past, been required to make certain modifications to our restaurants pursuant to the ADA. In addition, future mandated modifications to their facilities to make different accommodations for disabled persons and modifications required under the ADA could result in material unanticipated expense to us and our franchisees.\nAdditionally, we are required to comply with a number of anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act (Canada) and The Bribery Act of 2010 (U.K.), which prohibit improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The scope and enforcement of anti-corruption laws and regulations may vary. There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, licensees or agents will not violate these laws and regulations. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nFurthermore, certain changes to accounting standards, or changes to the interpretation of accounting standards applicable to us, could also materially affect our future results.\nIf we fail to comply with existing or future laws and regulations, we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions. In addition, our and our franchisees\u2019 capital expenditures could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any of these laws or regulations.\nThe personal information that we collect may be vulnerable to breach, theft or loss that could adversely affect our reputation, results of operation and financial condition.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect, process, transmit and retain personal information regarding our employees and their families, our franchisees, vendors and consumers, which can include social security numbers, social insurance numbers, banking and tax identification information, health care information and credit card information. Some of this personal information is held and managed by certain of our vendors. Although we use security and business controls to limit access and use of personal information, a third-party may be able to circumvent those security and business controls, which could result in a breach of employee, consumer or franchisee privacy. A major breach, theft or loss of personal information regarding our employees and their families, our franchisees, vendors or consumers that is held by us or our vendors could result in substantial fines, penalties and potential litigation against us which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, as a result of legislative and regulatory rules, we may be required to notify the owners of the personal information of any data breaches, which could harm our reputation and financial results, as well as subject us to litigation or actions by regulatory authorities.\nInformation technology system failures or interruptions or breaches of our network security may interrupt our operations, subject us to increased operating costs and expose us to litigation.\nWe rely heavily on our computer systems and network infrastructure across operations including, but not limited to, point-of-sale processing at our restaurants. Despite our implementation of security measures, all of our technology systems are vulnerable to damage, disability or failures due to physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events, as well as from internal and external security breaches, denial of service attacks, viruses, worms and other disruptive problems caused by hackers. If any of our technology systems were to fail, and we were unable to recover in a timely way, we could experience an interruption in its operations. Furthermore, if unauthorized access to or use of our systems were to occur, data related to our proprietary information could be compromised. The occurrence of any of these incidents could have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition and results of operations. To the extent that some of our worldwide reporting systems require or rely on manual processes, it could increase the risk of a breach.\nIn addition, a number of our systems and processes are not fully integrated worldwide and, as a result, require us to manually estimate and consolidate certain information that we use to manage our business. To the extent that we are not able to obtain transparency into our operations from our systems, it could impair the ability of our management to react quickly to changes in the business or economic environment.\nCompliance with or cleanup activities required by environmental laws may hurt our business.\nWe are subject to various federal, state, provincial, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations regarding climate change, energy consumption and our management, handling, release and/or disposal of water resources, air resources, hazardous or toxic substances, solid waste and other environmental matters. These laws and regulations provide for significant fines and penalties for noncompliance. If we fail to comply with these laws or regulations, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. Third parties may also make personal injury, property damage or other claims against us associated with releases of, or actual or alleged exposure to, hazardous substances at, on or from our properties. Environmental conditions relating to prior, existing or future restaurants or restaurant sites, including franchised sites, may have a material adverse effect on us. Moreover, the adoption of new or more stringent environmental laws or regulations could result in a material environmental liability to us and the current environmental condition of the properties could be harmed by tenants or other third parties or by the condition of land or operations in the vicinity of our properties.\nWe outsource certain aspects of our business to third-party vendors which subjects us to risks, including disruptions in our business and increased costs.\nWe have outsourced certain administrative functions for our business, including account payment and receivable processing, to a third-party service provider. We also outsource certain information technology support services and benefit plan administration. In the future, we may outsource other functions to achieve cost savings and efficiencies. If the service providers to which we outsource these functions do not perform effectively, we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings and may have to incur additional costs in connection with such failure to perform. Depending on the function involved, such failures may also lead to business disruption, transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of sales and customers, the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach, and the loss of sensitive data through security breach or otherwise. Any such damage or interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business, cause us to face significant fines, customer notice obligations or costly litigation, harm our reputation with our customers or prevent us from paying our collective suppliers or employees or receiving payments on a timely basis.\nWe are not in compliance with certain \u201cbest practices\u201d established by Canadian securities regulators in respect of corporate governance.\nThe chairman of our board of directors is not \u201cindependent\u201d for purposes of Canadian securities laws, and our nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees are not composed solely of independent directors. Accordingly, we are not in compliance with certain governance best practices set forth in National Policy 58-201 - Corporate Governance Guidelines and National Instrument 58-101 - Disclosure of Corporate Governance Practices with respect to standards of director independence. Accordingly, our shareholders will not have the same protections afforded to security holders of reporting issuers that are in compliance with the corporate governance best practices established by the Canadian Securities Administrators.\nCanadian legislation contains provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control.\nWe are a Canadian entity. The Investment Canada Act requires that a \u201cnon-Canadian,\u201d as defined therein, file an application for review with the Minister responsible for the Investment Canada Act and obtain approval of the Minister prior to acquiring control of a Canadian business, where prescribed financial thresholds are exceeded. This may discourage a potential acquirer from proposing or completing a transaction that may otherwise present a premium to shareholders. Otherwise, there are no limitations either under the laws of Canada or in our articles regarding the rights of non-Canadians to hold or vote our common shares.\nRisks Related to our Common shares\n3G owns 43.1% of the combined voting power with respect to the Company, and its interests may conflict with or differ from the interests of the other shareholders.\n3G Restaurant Brands Holdings LP (\u201c3G\u201d) currently owns approximately 43.1% of the combined voting power with respect to the Company. The interests of 3G and its principals may not always be aligned with the interests of the other shareholders of the Company. So long as 3G continues to directly or indirectly own a significant amount of the voting power of the Company, it will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control the business decisions of the Company. 3G and its principals may have interests that are different from those of the other shareholders of the Company, and 3G may exercise its voting and other rights in a manner that may be adverse to the interests of such shareholders.\nIn addition, this concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control or otherwise discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of the Company, which could cause the market price of the Company\u2019s common shares to decline or prevent the Company\u2019s shareholders from realizing a premium over the market price for their common shares or Partnership exchangeable units.\n3G is affiliated with 3G Capital Partners, Ltd. a New York private equity firm (\u201c3G Capital\u201d). 3G Capital is in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time in the future acquire or develop controlling interests in businesses engaged in the QSR industry that complement or directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business. In addition, 3G Capital may pursue acquisitions or opportunities that may be complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us.\nOur stock price may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance.\nThe market price of our common shares may fluctuate materially from time to time in response to a number of factors, many of which we cannot control, including those described under \u201cRisk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business\u201d. In addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of listed companies. These broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common shares, regardless of our operating performance. In addition, our share price may be dependent upon the valuations and recommendations of the analysts who cover our business, and if our results do not meet the analysts\u2019 forecasts and expectations, our share price could decline as a result of analysts lowering their valuations and recommendations or otherwise. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against companies. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nFuture sales of our common shares in the public market could cause volatility in the price of our common shares or cause the share price to fall.\nSales of a substantial number of our common shares in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common shares, and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.\nCertain holders of our common shares have required and others may require us to register their shares for resale under the U.S. and Canadian securities laws under the terms of certain separate registration rights agreements between us and the holders of these securities. Registration of those shares would allow the holders thereof to immediately resell their shares in the public market. Any such sales, or anticipation thereof, could cause the market price of our common shares to decline.\nIn addition, we have registered common shares that are reserved for issuance under our incentive plans.\nYour percentage ownership in us may be diluted by future issuances of capital stock, which could reduce the influence of our shareholders over matters on which our shareholders vote.\nOur board of directors has the authority, without action or vote of our shareholders, to issue an unlimited number of common shares. For example, we may issue our securities in connection with investments and acquisitions. The number of common shares issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of the then-outstanding common shares and could materially dilute the ownership of our shareholders. Issuances of common shares would reduce the influence of our common shareholders over matters on which our shareholders vote.\nThere is no assurance that we will pay any cash dividends on our common shares in the future.\nAlthough our board of directors declared a cash dividend on our common shares for each quarter of 2015, any future dividends on our common shares will be determined at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, including the terms of our preferred shares and agreements governing our debt and any future indebtedness we may incur, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant. Realization of a gain on an investment in our common shares and in Partnership exchangeable units will depend on the appreciation of the price of our common shares and Partnership exchangeable units, which may never occur.\nAdditional Factors Relating to Partnership Exchangeable Units\nAn active trading market for Partnership exchangeable units may not be sustained.\nPartnership exchangeable units are not listed on a national exchange in the United States. Although Partnership exchangeable units are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, an active public market for Partnership exchangeable units may not be sustained, and such market is not as liquid as for the Company common shares. If an active public market is not sustained, it may be difficult for investors who hold Partnership exchangeable units to sell their exchangeable units at a price that is attractive to them, or at all.\nPartnership exchangeable units may not trade equally with the Company common shares.\nAlthough now exchangeable, the Partnership exchangeable units are distinct securities from the Company\u2019s common shares. The Partnership exchangeable units and Company common shares will at all times trade separately, and the public market for Partnership exchangeable units is not as liquid as for the Company common shares. In addition, if a holder of Partnership exchangeable units exercises its exchange right, the Company, in its capacity as the general partner of Partnership and in its sole discretion, may cause Partnership to repurchase each Partnership exchangeable unit submitted for exchange in consideration for cash (in an amount determined in accordance with the terms of the partnership agreement) in lieu of exchanging for common shares. As such, Partnership exchangeable units may not trade equally with the Company common shares, and could trade at a discount to the market price of the Company common shares, which discount could possibly be material.\nThe exchange of Partnership exchangeable units into Company common shares is subject to certain restrictions and the value of the Company common shares received in any exchange may fluctuate.\nBeginning on December 12, 2015, holders of Partnership exchangeable units became entitled to require Partnership to exchange all or any portion of such holder\u2019s Partnership exchangeable units for Company common shares at a ratio of one Company common share for each Partnership exchangeable unit, subject to the right of the Company, in its capacity as the general partner of Partnership and in its sole discretion, to cause Partnership to repurchase the Partnership exchangeable units for cash (in an amount determined in accordance with the terms of the partnership agreement) in lieu of exchanging for Company common shares.\nThe Company common shares for which Partnership exchangeable units may be exchanged may be subject to significant fluctuations in value for many reasons, including:\n\u2022\nour operating and financial performance and prospects;\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions;\n\u2022\nthe risks described in this report;\n\u2022\nchanges to the competitive landscape in the industries or markets in which we operate;\n\u2022\nthe arrival or departure of key personnel; and\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press or the investment community.\nIf a holder of Partnership exchangeable units elects to exchange his or her Partnership exchangeable units for Company common shares, the exchange generally will be taxable for Canadian and U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nIn certain circumstances, a Limited Partner may lose its limited liability status.\nThe Limited Partnerships Act (Ontario) (the \u201cOntario Limited Partnerships Act\u201d) provides that a limited partner benefits from limited liability unless, in addition to exercising rights and powers as a limited partner, such limited partner takes part in the control of the business of a limited partnership of which such limited partner is a partner. Subject to the provisions of the Ontario Limited Partnerships Act and of similar legislation in other jurisdictions of Canada, the liability of each limited partner for the debts, liabilities and obligations of Partnership will be limited to the limited partner\u2019s capital contribution, plus the limited partner\u2019s share of any undistributed income of Partnership. However, pursuant to the Ontario Limited Partnerships Act, where a limited partner has received the return of all or part of that limited partner\u2019s capital contribution, the limited partner would be liable to Partnership or, where Partnership is dissolved, to its creditors, for any amount, not in excess of the amount of capital contribution returned with interest, necessary to discharge the liabilities of Partnership to all creditors who extended credit or whose claims otherwise arose before the return of the capital contribution. A limited partner holds as trustee for the limited partnership any money or other property that is paid or conveyed to the limited partner as a return of the limited partner\u2019s contribution that is made contrary to the Ontario Limited Partnerships Act.\nThe limitation of liability conferred under the Ontario Limited Partnerships Act may be ineffective outside Ontario except to the extent it is given extra-territorial recognition or effect by the laws of other jurisdictions. There may also be requirements to be satisfied in each jurisdiction to maintain limited liability. If limited liability is lost, limited partners may be considered to be general partners (and therefore be subject to unlimited liability) in such jurisdiction by creditors and others having claims against Partnership.", "PERMNO": 91212, "SIC": 5812, "TIC": "QSR"}
