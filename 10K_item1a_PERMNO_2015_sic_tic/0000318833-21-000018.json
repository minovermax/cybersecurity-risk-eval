RISK FACTORS\nOur business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or stock price could be materially adversely affected by any of the risks and uncertainties described below.\nRisks Related to Market Conditions\nThe recent COVID-19 pandemic and related economic repercussions have had, and are expected to continue to have, a significant impact on our business, and depending on the duration of the pandemic and its effect on the oil and gas industry, could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. Our clients in the oil and gas industry have historically accounted for a substantial portion of our revenues. The COVID-19 pandemic and related economic repercussions have created significant volatility, uncertainty and turmoil in the oil and gas industry resulting in reductions in demand for oil and gas supply. These events have directly affected our business and have exacerbated the potential negative impact from many of our risks, including those relating to our clients\u2019 capital spending and trends in oil and natural gas prices.\nAs COVID-19 continues to have global impacts, including significant impacts in the United States, Canada and the European Union, where we operate, we are taking a variety of measures to ensure the availability of our services, promote the safety and security of our employees, and preserve liquidity. However, despite our efforts to manage the impacts, public and private sector policies and initiatives to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, such as closures of businesses and manufacturing facilities, the promotion of social distancing, the adoption of working from home by companies and institutions, and travel restrictions, could continue to adversely affect demand for our services. These policies and initiatives have not only led to operational inefficiencies but have had a negative impact on our cost of operations and continued COVID-19 outbreaks have led to deferrals of client projects. In addition, COVID-19 and related initiatives may result in greater supply chain disruption, which could have an adverse impact on volumes and make it more difficult for us to serve our clients. The full extent to which COVID-19 impacts operations will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration or future recurrence of the outbreak, emerging scientific or technological information concerning prevention, treatment and vaccination, and new governmental policies put in place to contain the health and economic impact of COVID-19 in the future, among others. Potential conflicts between federal and local government guidelines and best practices that are intended to reduce the spread of COVID-19 could result in stricter measures in certain locations that could expose us to increased risks and costs.\nThe confluence of events described above have had, and are expected to continue to have, a significant impact on our business, and depending on the duration of the pandemic and its effect on the oil and gas industry, could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition. To the extent COVID-19 adversely affects our business, liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition, it may also have the effect of heightening other risks.\nThe economic environment may affect client demand for our services. Future economic and political uncertainty may reduce the availability of liquidity and credit and, in many cases, reduce demand for our clients\u2019 products. Disruption of the credit markets could also adversely affect our clients\u2019 ability to finance ongoing maintenance and new capital projects, resulting in contract cancellations or suspensions, capital project delays, repurposing of infrastructure, and infrastructure closures. An extended or deep recession may result in plant closures or other contractions in our client base. These factors may also adversely affect our ability to collect payment for work we have previously performed. Furthermore, our ability to expand our business could be limited if, in the future, we are unable to increase our credit capacity under favorable terms or at all. Such disruptions, should they occur, could materially impact our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nExtended periods of low prices for crude oil can have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. While we continue to expand our market presence in the areas of aerospace and defense, construction, chemical processing, manufacturing, power generation, and public infrastructure, among other industries, economic downturns within the oil and gas industry including crude oil prices have, and could continue to, result in reduction in demand for our services.\nOur revenues are heavily dependent on certain industries. Sales of our services are dependent on clients in certain industries, particularly the refining and petrochemical industries. As we have experienced in the past, and as we expect to occur in the future, downturns characterized by diminished demand for services in these industries as well as potential changes due to\nconsolidation or changes in client businesses or governmental regulations, could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Certain of our clients have employees represented by unions and could be subject to temporary work stoppage which could impact our activity level.\nWe sell our services in highly competitive markets, which places pressure on our profit margins and limits our ability to maintain or increase the market share of our services. Our competition generally stems from other outside service contractors, many of whom offer a similar range of services. Future economic uncertainty could generally reduce demand for industrial services and thus create a more competitive bidding environment for new and existing work. No assurances can be made that we will continue to maintain our pricing model and our profit margins or increase our market share.\nOur ongoing investments in new client markets involve significant risks, could disrupt our current operations and may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect. Our ability to compete successfully in new client markets depends on our ability to continue to deliver innovative, relevant and useful services to our clients in a timely manner. As a result, we have invested, and expect to continue to invest resources in developing products and services to new clients. Such investments may not prioritize short-term financial results and may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including encountering new competitors. We may fail to generate sufficient revenue, operating margin or other value to justify our investments in such new client markets, thereby harming our ability to generate revenue.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nIf we are not able to implement commercially competitive services in a timely manner in response to changes in the market, client requirements, competitive pressures and technology trends, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Competition can place downward pressure on our contract prices and profit margins. Our share of the market for our services is characterized by continual technological developments to provide better and more cost-effective services. If we are not able to implement commercially competitive services and products in a timely manner in response to changes in the market, client requirements, competitive pressures and technology trends, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Likewise, if our proprietary technologies, equipment, facilities, or work processes become obsolete, we may no longer be competitive, and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur business depends upon the maintenance of our proprietary technologies and information. We depend on our proprietary technologies and information, many of which are no longer subject to patent protection. In addition to patent protection, we rely significantly upon trade secret laws to protect our proprietary technologies. We regularly enter into confidentiality agreements with our key employees, clients, potential clients and other third parties and limit access to and distribution of our trade secrets and other proprietary information. However, these measures may not be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technologies or to assure that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technologies. In addition, because we operate worldwide, the laws of other countries in which we operate may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. We are also subject to the risk of adverse claims and litigation alleging infringement of intellectual property rights\nNo assurances can be made that we will be successful in maintaining or renewing our contracts with our clients. A significant portion of our contracts and agreements with clients may be terminated by either party on short notice. Although we actively pursue the renewal of our contracts, we cannot assure that we will be able to renew these contracts or that the terms of the renewed contracts will be as favorable as the existing contracts. If we are unable to renew or replace these contracts, or if we renew on less favorable terms, we may suffer a material reduction in revenue and earnings.\nNo assurances can be made that we will be successful in hiring or retaining members of a skilled technical workforce. We have a skilled technical workforce and an industry recognized technician training program for each of our service lines that prepares new employees as well as further trains our existing employees. The competition for these individuals is intense. Due to the impacts of COVID-19, we have implemented workforce furloughs, reduced personnel compensation, reduced headcount and eliminated all non-essential costs, which increases our risk of losing key skilled employees. Furthermore, once the economic environment and demand for our services has recovered, we will be under pressure to re-hire or onboard employees during a time when there could be a significant demand for skilled labor. The loss of these individuals, or failure to attract new employees, could adversely affect our ability to perform our obligations on our clients\u2019 projects or maintenance and consequently could negatively impact the demand for our products and services.\nThe loss or unavailability of any of our executive officers or other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business. We depend greatly on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees to manage and exercise leadership over our operations. The loss or unavailability of any of our executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business operations.\nUnsatisfactory quality of service execution, including safety performance, can affect client relationships, eliminate or reduce revenue streams from our largest clients, result in higher operating costs and negatively impact our ability to hire\nand retain a skilled technical workforce. The services we provide could incur quality of execution issues that may be caused by our workforce personnel and/or components we purchase from other manufacturers or suppliers. If the quality of our services does not meet our clients\u2019 expectations or satisfaction, then our sales and operating earnings, and, ultimately, our reputation, could be negatively impacted. Additionally, our workers are subject to the normal hazards associated with providing services at industrial facilities. Even with proper safety precautions, these hazards can lead to personal injury, loss of life, destruction of property, plant and equipment, lower employee morale and environmental damage. While we are intensely focused on maintaining a strong safety environment and minimizing the risk of accidents, there can be no assurance that these efforts will be effective. Poor safety performance may limit or eliminate potential revenue streams, including from many of our largest clients, and may materially increase our operating costs, including increasing our required insurance deductibles, self-insured retention and insurance premium costs.\nAdditional impairments of our goodwill, impairments of our intangible and other long-lived assets, and changes in the estimated useful lives of intangible assets could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. As a result of past acquisitions, goodwill and other intangible assets comprise a significant portion of our total assets. As of December 31, 2020, our goodwill and intangible assets totaled $91.4 million and $103.3 million, respectively. We assess or test goodwill for impairment at least annually in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the U.S. (\u201cGAAP\u201d), while our other long-lived assets, including our finite-lived intangible assets, are tested for impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. A decrease in our market capitalization or profitability or unfavorable changes in market, economic and industry conditions all would increase the risk of impairment.\nAs discussed, the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent mitigation efforts, which included global business and societal shutdowns and the implementation of mandatory social distancing requirements, created an unprecedented disruption to our business during 2020. These mitigation efforts coupled with the negative economic impacts to the oil and gas industry caused by the substantial decline in the global demand for oil and the concurrent surplus in the supply of oil have significantly impacted our business. Even though our services are primarily related to infrastructure support, the oil and gas industry is one of the key industries we serve, and our clients have been significantly impacted as a result of these events.\nAs our clients continue to adjust spending levels in response to the lower commodity prices, we have experienced activity reductions and pricing pressure for our products and services, primarily in our IHT and MS reporting units, which we expect to continue. In line with these rapidly changing market conditions, our market capitalization also deteriorated during 2020 and most significantly in late March 2020. In response to these events and the related decline in our forecasts from the COVID-19 pandemic, we announced cost-cutting measures to offset the expected impact to our business. We determined the totality of these events constituted a triggering event that required us to perform an interim goodwill impairment assessment as of March 31, 2020.\nBased upon our impairment assessment, we determined the carrying amount of our IHT reporting unit exceeded the fair value. As a result, we recorded $191.8 million in goodwill impairment charges on our IHT segment during the first quarter of 2020. The fair value of the MS and Quest Integrity reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values.\nWe test goodwill annually for impairment as of December 1 of each year. Our annual goodwill impairment tests for 2020 did not result in any additional impairment. However, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of our most recent goodwill impairment test will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. Accordingly, we may be required to recognize additional impairment charges in future reporting periods, which could materially and adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nGAAP requires that we evaluate the useful lives of our intangible assets subject to amortization each reporting period. If the estimate of an intangible asset\u2019s remaining useful life is changed, the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset is amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life. To the extent the revised useful life of an intangible asset is less than originally estimated, our future amortization expense will increase, which could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nImprovements in operating results from expected savings in operating costs from workforce reductions and other cost saving and business improvement initiatives may not be realized in the estimated amounts, may take longer to be realized, or could be realized only for a limited period. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we engaged outside consultants to assess all aspects of our business for improvement and cost saving opportunities as part of a new cost savings and business improvement project. In the first quarter of 2018, we completed the design phase of the project, known as OneTEAM, and are now in the deployment phase. In the third quarter of 2019, we began the design phase of OneTEAM for our international operations. We expect to incur various additional expenses associated with the execution of the OneTEAM project through the first quarter of 2021 with funding provided by our operating cash flows and our credit facilities. However, in order to implement this or any other future cost savings or business improvement initiatives, we expect to incur additional expenses, which could adversely impact our financial results prior to the realization of the expected benefits associated with the initiatives. Due to numerous factors or future developments, we may not achieve cost reductions or other business improvements consistent with our expectations or\nthe benefits may be delayed. These factors or future developments could include (i) the incurrence of higher than expected costs or delays in reassigning and retraining remaining employees or outsourcing or eliminating duties and functions of eliminated employees, (ii) unanticipated delays in discharging employees in eliminated positions as a result of regulatory or legal limitations on employee terminations in certain jurisdictions, (iii) actual savings differing from anticipated cost savings, (iv) anticipated benefits from business improvement initiatives not materializing and (v) disruptions to normal operations or other unintended adverse impacts resulting from the initiatives.\nWe may also decide to reduce, suspend or terminate our cost saving and business improvement initiatives at any time before achieving the estimated benefits or after a limited period of time. The elimination of current employees can also result in increased future costs in hiring, training and mobilizing new employees or rehires in the event of a future increase in demand for our services resulting in a slower recovery of results from operations. Our initiatives may negatively affect our ability to retain and attract qualified personnel, who may experience uncertainty about their future roles with us.\nWe may experience cost overruns on our projects. A number of our clients are serviced under fixed price contracts or contracts including a combination of fixed and variable elements, where we bear a portion of the risk for cost overruns. Under such contracts, prices are established in part on cost and scheduling estimates, which are based on a number of assumptions, including assumptions about future economic conditions, prices and availability of subcontractors, materials and other exigencies of our services. Our profitability depends heavily on our ability to make accurate estimates. Inaccurate estimates, or changes in other circumstances, such as unanticipated technical problems, difficulties obtaining permits or approvals, changes in local laws or labor conditions, weather delays, cost of raw materials, trade disputes and tariffs, currency fluctuations or our suppliers' or subcontractors' inability to perform could result in substantial losses, as such changes adversely affect the revenues recognized on each project.\nAdditionally, we may incur significant costs in excess of estimates due to changes to any work orders requested by our clients materially changing the scope of work to be completed by us. Our services are usually performed pursuant to purchase orders issued under written client agreements. We may be required to perform additional services that were not contemplated in the pricing related to any such purchaser order, including services resulting from client requested changes, incomplete or inaccurate engineering, changes in project specifications and other similar information provided to us by the client which form the basis for our original estimates. We recognize revenue proportionately as costs are incurred, therefore, we may be required to adjusted revenue recognize on fixed contract projects in the event we incur actual costs in excess of our estimates for such project if we are unable to obtain adequate compensation for any such additional services.\nEconomic, political and other risks associated with international operations could adversely affect our business. A portion of our operations are conducted and located outside the U.S., and accordingly, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, instability in political or economic conditions, difficulty in repatriating cash proceeds, differing employee relations, differing regulatory environments, trade protection measures, and difficulty in administering and enforcing corporate policies which may be different than the normal business practices of local cultures. In many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by U.S. and foreign anti-corruption regulations applicable to us such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom Bribery Act. Our international business operations may include projects in countries where corruption is prevalent. Although we have, and continue to, implement and enforce policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors or agents, including those representing us in countries where practices which violate such anti-corruption laws may be customary, will not take actions in violation of our policies and procedures. Any violation of foreign or U.S. laws by our employees, contractors or agents, even if such violation is prohibited by our policies and procedures, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nBusiness acquisitions entail risk for investors. From time to time, we pursue acquisitions in, or complementary to, the specialty maintenance and specialty industrial services, including inspection, engineering assessment and mechanical services to complement and diversify our existing business. We may also acquire other businesses that enhance our services or geographic scope. We may not be able to expand our market presence through acquisitions, and acquisitions may present unforeseen integration difficulties or costs. No assurances can be made that we will realize the cost savings, synergies or revenue enhancements that we may anticipate from any acquisition, or that we will realize such benefits within the time frame that we expect. If we are not able to address the challenges associated with acquisitions and successfully integrate acquired businesses, or if our integrated product and service offerings fail to achieve market acceptance, our business could be adversely affected. The consideration paid in connection with an acquisition may also affect our share price or future financial results depending on the structure of such consideration. To the extent we issue stock or other rights to purchase stock, including options or other rights, existing shareholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease. In addition, acquisitions may result in the incurrence of additional debt.\nThe price of our outstanding securities may be volatile. It is possible that in some future quarter (or quarters) our revenues, operating results or other measures of financial performance will not meet the expectations of public stock market\nanalysts or investors, which could cause the price of our outstanding securities to decline or be volatile. Historically, our quarterly and annual sales and operating results have fluctuated. We expect fluctuations to continue in the future. In addition to general economic and political conditions, and in addition to the other factors identified under this Item 1A \u201cRisk Factors\u201d, the following factors may affect our sales and operating results: the timing of significant client orders, the timing of planned maintenance projects at client facilities, changes in competitive pricing, wide variations in profitability by product line, variations in operating expenses, rapid increases in raw material and labor costs, the timing of announcements or introductions of new products or services by us, our competitors or our respective clients, the acceptance of those services, our ability to adequately meet staffing requirements with qualified personnel, relative variations in manufacturing efficiencies and costs, and the relative strength or weakness of international markets. Since our quarterly and annual revenues and operating results vary, we believe that period-to-period comparisons are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of our future performance.\nOur business may be adversely impacted by work stoppages, staffing shortages and other labor matters. Although we believe that our relations with our employees are good and we have had no strikes or work stoppages, no assurances can be made that we will not experience these and other types of conflicts with labor unions, works councils, other groups representing employees, or our employees in general, or that any future negotiations with our labor unions will not result in significant increases in the cost of labor.\nWe extend credit to clients for purchases of our services which subjects us to potential credit risk that could, if realized, adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If we are unable to collect amounts owed to us, or retain amounts paid to us, our cash flows would be reduced and we could experience losses. We would also recognize losses with respect to any receivables that are impaired as a result of our clients\u2019 financial difficulties or bankruptcies. The risk of loss may increase for capital projects where we provide services over a longer period of time. Credit losses could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAs a result of our geographically diverse and decentralized operations within the United States and other countries around the world, we are more susceptible to certain risks. We have offices and operations throughout the world. This creates greater financial and operational risks due to the nature of our operations being conducted at various locations. While we have robust internal controls, policies and procedures, and employee training and compliance programs to deter prohibited practices, they may not be effective in preventing employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies or from material violations of applicable laws and regulations.\nRisks Related to Financing Our Business\nWe are subject to risks associated with indebtedness under our credit facilities, including the risk of failure to maintain compliance with financial covenants, the risk of being unable to make interest and principal payments when due and the risk of rising interest rates. On December 18, 2020, we entered into an asset-based credit agreement (the \u201cABL Facility\u201d) led by Citibank, N.A., as agent, which provides for available borrowings up to $150 million. The ABL Facility matures and all outstanding amounts become due and payable on December 18, 2024. However, if our 5.00% Convertible Senior Notes, which mature on August 1, 2023 (the \u201cNotes\u201d), have an aggregate principal amount of $50 million or more outstanding 120 days prior to their maturity date (the \u201cTrigger Date\u201d), or if there are Notes in an aggregate principal amount of less than $50 million outstanding and we do not have sufficient excess availability of more than 20% under the ABL Facility on the Trigger Date, the ABL Facility will terminate on the Trigger Date.\nThe ABL Facility contains customary conditions to borrowings, events of default and covenants. In the event that our excess availability is less than the greater of (i) $15.0 million and (ii) 10.00% of the lesser of (1) the current borrowing base and (2) the commitments under the ABL Facility then in effect, a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.00 to 1.00 must be maintained. Upon the occurrence of certain events of default, an additional 2.0% interest maybe required on the outstanding loans under the ABL Facility.\nOn December 18, 2020, we also entered into a credit agreement with Atlantic Park Strategic Capital Fund, L.P., as agent, and APSC Holdco II, L.P. (\u201cAPSC\u201d), as lender, pursuant to which we borrowed a $250.0 million term loan (the \u201cTerm Loan\u201d). The Term Loan matures, and all outstanding amounts become due and payable on December 18, 2026, provided that certain conditions could result in an earlier maturity, including if the Notes have an aggregate principal amount outstanding of $50 million or more on the Trigger Date, in which case the Term Loan will terminate on the Trigger Date.\nThe Term Loan contains customary payment penalties, events of default and covenants. Commencing with the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2022, we are also required to maintain a net leverage ratio of less than or equal to 7.00 to 1.00, calculated quarterly on a trailing twelve-month basis. In addition, our capital expenditures may not exceed $33.0 million during any four fiscal quarter period. This covenant will not apply if the total net leverage ratio is less than or equal to 4.00 to 1.00 at the end of the second and fourth quarter of each year.\nOur ability to maintain compliance with the financial covenants is dependent upon our future operating performance and future financial condition, both of which are subject to various risks and uncertainties. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the decline in oil and gas end markets could have a significant adverse effect on our financial position and business condition, as well as our clients and suppliers. Additionally, these events may, among other factors, impact our ability to generate cash flows from operations, access the capital markets on acceptable terms or at all, and affect our future need or ability to borrow under our ABL Facility. In addition to our current sources of funding our business, the effects of such events may impact our liquidity or our need to revise our allocation or sources of capital, implement further cost reduction measures and/or change our business strategy. Although the COVID-19 pandemic and decline in the oil and gas end markets could have a broad range of effects on our liquidity sources, the effects will depend on future developments and cannot be predicted at this time.\nWe rely primarily on cash flows from our operations to make required interest and principal payments on our debt. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from our operations, we may be unable to pay interest and principal obligations on our debt when they become due. Failure to comply with these obligations or failure to comply with the financial covenants discussed above could result in an event of default, which would permit our lenders to accelerate the repayment of the debt. If our lenders accelerate the repayment of debt, there is no assurance that we could refinance such debt on terms favorable to us or at all.\nOur ABL Facility and Term Loan bear interest at variable market rates. If market interest rates increase, our interest expense and cash flows could be adversely impacted. Based on borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2020, an increase in market interest rates of 100 basis points would increase our interest expense and decrease our operating cash flows by approximately $1.2 million on an annual basis.\nOur ABL Facility and Term Loan restrict our ability to, among other items, incur additional indebtedness, engage in mergers, acquisitions and dispositions and alter the business conducted by us. These restrictions could adversely affect our ability to operate our businesses and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise.\nThe accounting method for our convertible debt securities may have a material effect on our reported financial results. On July 31, 2017 we issued $230.0 million principal amount of 5.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 in a private offering. In December 2020, we retired $136.9 million par value of our Notes for $135.5 million, excluding accrued interest, using proceeds from the Term Loan and borrowings under the ABL Facility. As of December 31, 2020, the principal amount of Notes outstanding was $93.1 million.\nConvertible debt instruments (such as the Notes) that may be settled entirely or partly in cash are currently accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method if we have the ability and intent to settle in cash, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the Notes exceeds their principal amount and if the effect would be dilutive. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued. We cannot be sure that we will be able to demonstrate the ability or intent to settle the Notes in cash in any future reporting period. Additionally, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) has recently issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity\u2019s Own Equity, which will eliminate the use of the treasury stock method to calculate diluted earnings per share. We expect to adopt ASU 2020-06 beginning January 1, 2022, at which time we would utilize the if-converted method, which would require us to assume the Notes would be settled entirely in shares of common stock for purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share, if the effect would be dilutive. In such case, our diluted earnings per share would be adversely affected.\nTransactions relating to our convertible debt securities may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders, or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock. The Notes are convertible into 4,291,705 shares of common stock. Upon conversion, we may settle the Notes in cash or in shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, in each case, at our election. If the Notes are converted, our current intent is to settle the principal amount of the Notes in cash and settle the remainder of our conversion obligation by issuing shares of common stock; however, we cannot guarantee that we will have sufficient funds available to us at the time of any such conversions in order to effect settlement in that manner. In such case, we could elect to settle the conversion obligation in a different combination of cash and shares of common stock or entirely in shares of common stock, depending on the circumstances. To the extent we deliver shares of common stock upon conversion of the Notes, the ownership interests of existing stockholders would be diluted. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Information Systems\nOur operations and information systems, including our employee, client and financial records, are subject to cybersecurity risks. We continue to increase dependence on digital technologies to conduct our operations. Many of our files, including employee, client and financial records, are digitized and more employees are working in almost paperless and remote environments. We have also outsourced certain information technology development, maintenance and support functions. As a result, we may be exposed to potentially severe cyber incidents at both our internal locations and outside vendor locations that could result in a theft of sensitive data and/or intellectual property, alteration or deletion of critical data and/or disruption of its operations for an extended period of time. This could also result in claims, losses, fines and higher costs to correct and remedy the effects of such incidents, although no such material incidents have occurred to date to our knowledge.\nInterruptions in the proper functioning of our information systems could disrupt operations and cause increases in costs and/or decreases in revenues. The proper functioning of our information systems is critical to the successful operation of our business. Although our information systems are protected through physical and software safeguards, our information systems are still vulnerable to natural disasters, power losses, telecommunication failures and other problems. If critical information systems fail or are otherwise unavailable, our business operations could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Regulations\nFluctuations in our effective tax rate and our tax obligations could adversely affect our financial results. We are subject to taxes in the U.S. and in various foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision, which includes assessing the restrictions on tax credits, offset gains or repatriation of cash proceeds, tax assets and accruals for other taxes, and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected by our profit levels, changes in our business, reorganization of our business and operating structure, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the elections we make, changes in applicable tax laws or interpretations of existing tax laws or changes in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, as well as other factors.\nWe are also currently subject to audit in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments in an audit, litigation, or the relevant laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods.\nOur operations and properties are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety regulations. We are subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state, local and international laws and regulations relating to the environment, and worker health and safety, among other things. These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, are becoming increasingly stringent, and can impose substantial sanctions for violations or require operational changes that may limit our services. We must conform our operations to comply with applicable regulatory requirements and adapt to changes in such requirements in all locations in which we operate. These requirements can be expected to increase the overall costs of providing our services over time. Some of our services involve handling or monitoring highly regulated materials, including volatile organic compounds or hazardous wastes. Environmental laws and regulations generally impose limitations and standards for the characterization, handling, disposal, discharge or emission of regulated materials and require us to obtain permits and comply with various other requirements. The improper characterization, handling, or disposal of regulated materials or any other failure by us to comply with increasingly complex and strictly-enforced federal, state, local, and international environmental, health and safety laws and regulations or associated permits could subject us to the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations or capital expenditure requirements, or the issuance of injunctions that could restrict or prevent our ability to operate our business and complete contracted services. A defect in our services or faulty workmanship could result in an environmental liability if, as a result of the defect or faulty workmanship, a contaminant is released into the environment. In addition, the modification or interpretation of existing environmental, health and safety laws or regulations, the more vigorous enforcement of existing laws or regulations, or the adoption of new laws or regulations may also negatively impact industries in which our clients operate, which in turn could have a negative impact on us.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d could result in reduced demand for our services and products. There has been an increased focus in the last several years on climate change in response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases present an endangerment to public health and the environment. As a result, there have been a variety of regulatory developments, proposals or requirements and legislative initiatives that have been introduced in the U.S. and other parts of the world that are focused on restricting the emission of greenhouse gases. The new Presidential administration has also emphasized its intention to actively pursue its policy goals of addressing global climate change through significant economy-wide reductions in greenhouse gases and hastening the transition from carbon-based energy sources. The adoption of new or more stringent legislation or regulatory programs limiting greenhouse gas emissions from clients, particularly those in refining and petrochemical industries, for whom we provide repair and maintenance services, or reducing the demand for those clients\u2019 products, could in turn affect demand for our products and\nservices. Some of our clients are modifying their plants and facilities in efforts to better align their operations and products with these energy transition issues, but there is no assurance that such modified facilities will require the same level of services and product that we currently provide.\nFinally, some scientists have concluded that increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere may produce physical effects, such as increased severity and frequency of storms, droughts, floods and other climate events. Such climate events have the potential to adversely affect our operations or those of our clients, which in turn could have a negative effect on us. Such events, if increasing in their severity and frequency, may also adversely affect our ability to insure against the risks associated with such events, thus leading to greater financial risk for us in the conduct of our operations against the backdrop of such events.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s (the \u201cU.K.\u201d) departure from the European Union (the \u201cEU\u201d) could adversely affect us. On January 31, 2020, the U.K. departed from the EU (commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d). Although the long-term effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the U.K. makes to retain access to the EU markets, Brexit has created additional uncertainties that may result in new regulatory costs and challenges such as increased restrictions on imports and exports throughout Europe. The effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the U.K. reaches to retain access to EU markets. The outcome of Brexit caused volatility in global stock markets and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and uncertainty about the terms and impact of Brexit may continue to do so in the future. Brexit could adversely affect U.K., regional European and worldwide economic and market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the British Pound and Euro, which in turn could adversely affect our clients, particularly in the U.K. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. negotiates with the EU. In particular, depending on the terms of Brexit, we may face new regulatory costs and challenges, including additional regulatory licensing to operate in the U.K. market, adding costs and potential inconsistency to our business and we could also be required to comply with regulatory requirements in the U.K. that are in addition to, or inconsistent with, the regulatory requirements of the EU. Any of these effects of Brexit and others we cannot anticipate could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are subject to privacy and data security/protection laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate and may be exposed to substantial costs and liabilities associated with such laws and regulations. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with frequent imposition of new and changing requirements. Compliance with changes in privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the payment of potentially significant fines or penalties in the event of a breach or other privacy and information security laws, as well as the negative publicity associated with such a breach, could damage our reputation and adversely impact product demand and client relationships.\nRisks Related to Legal Liability\nOur insurance coverage will not fully indemnify us against certain claims or losses. Further, our insurance has limits and exclusions and not all losses or claims are insured. We perform services in hazardous environments on or around high-pressure, high temperature systems and our employees are exposed to a number of hazards, including exposure to hazardous materials, explosion hazards and fire hazards. Incidents that occur at these large industrial facilities or systems, regardless of fault, may be catastrophic and adversely impact our employees and third parties by causing serious personal injury, loss of life, damage to property or the environment, and interruption of operations. Our contracts typically require us to indemnify our clients for injury, damage or loss arising out of our presence at our clients\u2019 location, regardless of fault, or the performance of our services and provide for warranties for materials and workmanship. We may also be required to name the client as an additional insured under our insurance policies. We maintain limited insurance coverage against these and other risks associated with our business. Due to the high cost of general liability coverage, we maintain insurance with a self-insured retention of $1.0 million and a deductible of $2.0 million per occurrence. This insurance may not protect us against liability for certain events, including events involving pollution, product or professional liability, losses resulting from business interruption or acts of terrorism or damages from our breach of contract. We cannot assure you that our insurance will be adequate in risk coverage or policy limits to cover all losses or liabilities that we may incur. Moreover, in the future, due to evolving market conditions and its impact on pricing, we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate. Any future damages caused by our products or services that are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nWe are involved and are likely to continue to be involved in legal proceedings, which will increase our costs and, if adversely determined, could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. We are currently a defendant in legal proceedings arising from the operation of our business and it is reasonable to expect that we will be named in future actions. Most of the legal proceedings against us arise out of the normal course of performing services at client facilities, and include claims for workers\u2019 compensation, personal injury and property damage. Legal proceedings can be\nexpensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time, regardless of the ultimate outcome. An unsuccessful defense of a liability claim could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nOther Risk Factors\nOther risk factors may include interruption of our operations, or the operations of our clients due to fire, floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks, labor disruptions, health epidemics and other events beyond our control.\nAny of these factors, individually or in combination, could materially and adversely affect our future results of operations, financial position, cash flows and/or stock price and could also affect whether any forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K ultimately prove to be accurate.", "PERMNO": 65752, "SIC": 8734, "TIC": "TISI"}
