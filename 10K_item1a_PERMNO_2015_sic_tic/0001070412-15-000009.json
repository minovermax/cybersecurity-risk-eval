The following sets forth factors related to our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance or cash flows which could cause an investment in our securities to decline and result in a loss.\nDeterioration in the global economic conditions in any of the industries in which our customers operate, or a worldwide financial downturn, such as the 2008 - 2009 financial crisis, or negative credit market conditions may have lasting effects on our liquidity, business and financial condition that we cannot predict.\nEconomic conditions in a number of industries in which our customers operate, such as electric power generation and steel making, substantially deteriorated in recent years and reduced the demand for natural gas and coal. Although global industrial activity recovered from 2009 levels, the general economic challenges for some of our customers continued in 2014 and the outlook is uncertain. In addition, liquidity is essential to our business and developing our assets. Renewed or continued weakness in the economic conditions of any of the industries served by our customers could adversely affect our business and financial condition in a number of ways. For example:\n\u2022\ndemand for natural gas and electricity in the United States is impacted by industrial production, which if weakened would negatively impact the revenues, margins and profitability of our natural gas and thermal coal business;\n\u2022\ndemand for metallurgical coal depends on steel demand in the United States and globally, which if weakened would negatively impact the revenues, margins and profitability of our metallurgical coal business including our ability to sell our thermal coal as higher-priced high volatile metallurgical coal;\n\u2022\nthe tightening of credit or lack of credit availability to our customers could adversely affect our ability to collect our trade receivables and the amount of receivables eligible for sale pursuant to our accounts receivable securitization facility may decline; and\n\u2022\nour ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to raise capital for our business including for exploration and/or development of our gas or coal reserves.\nPrices for natural gas, natural gas liquids and coal are volatile and can fluctuate widely based upon a number of factors beyond our control including oversupply relative to the demand available for our products, weather and the price and availability of alternative fuels. An extended decline in the prices we receive for our natural gas, natural gas liquids, and coal will adversely affect our operating results and cash flows.\nOur financial results are significantly affected by the prices we receive for our natural gas, natural gas liquids, oil and coal.\nNatural gas, natural gas liquids and oil accounted for approximately 32% of our outside sales revenues from continuing operations in 2014. Natural gas, natural gas liquids and oil prices are very volatile and can fluctuate widely based upon supply from energy producers relative to demand for these products and other factors beyond our control. The sale to Murray Energy in 2013 of almost one half of our thermal coal production increased our exposure to fluctuations in the price of metallurgical coal, natural gas, natural gas liquids and oil.\nIn particular, while demand for natural gas has recovered to pre-recession levels, the U.S. natural gas industry continues to face concerns of oversupply due to the success of Marcellus and other new shale plays. The oversupply of natural gas in 2012 resulted in domestic prices hovering around ten year lows, and drilling continued in these plays, despite lower gas prices, to meet drilling commitments. Although gas prices recovered somewhat during 2013 and the first quarter of 2014, they again significantly declined in the latter part of 2014 due to oversupply.\nOur gas operations are geographically concentrated in the mid-Atlantic states. The success of the Marcellus Shale play and development of other Shale plays has resulted in growth in gas production in this region with production per day in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio more than doubling since 2011. Traditionally, natural gas produced in the mid-Atlantic states sold at a premium to the benchmark Louisiana Henry Hub prices. However, as Appalachian production increased this premium narrowed and during 2014, the spot prices at some Appalachian hubs fell below Henry Hub prices. This decline, or negative basis, to the Henry Hub price is forecasted to continue in future years and may widen due to anticipated further increased Appalachian gas production. Oversupply from the continued drilling in these plays, despite lower prices, directly affects prices we receive. Thus, apart from the general impact of domestic production on overall gas prices, the price paid for\nour natural gas also may be adversely affected by increasing production and oversupply in our market. Low gas prices adversely impact our gas operations revenues and earnings before income taxes.\nAn extended period of lower natural gas prices could negatively affect us in several other ways. These include reduced cash flow, which would decrease funds available for capital expenditures employed to replace reserves or increase production. For example, in light of the low natural gas prices during 2012, the number of wells drilled in our Noble joint venture during 2012 was significantly reduced from the number we initially planned to drill. Also, our access to other sources of capital, such as equity or long-term debt markets, could be severely limited or unavailable. Additionally, lower natural gas prices may reduce the amount of natural gas that we can produce economically. This may result in our having to make substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves. If this occurs, or if our estimates of development costs increase, production data factors change or our exploration results deteriorate, accounting rules may require us to write down, as a non-cash charge to earnings, the carrying value of our natural gas properties. We are required to perform impairment tests on our assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction of the estimated useful life or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or whenever management's plans change with respect to those assets. We may incur impairment charges in the future, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in the period taken.\nWe and our joint venture partners have increased drilling activity in areas of shale formations which may also contain natural gas liquids and/or oil. The prices for natural gas liquids and oil are also volatile for reasons similar to those described above regarding natural gas. As a result of increasing supply, including from shale plays, oil prices fell to five year lows during 2014. In addition, similar to the oversupply of natural gas, increased drilling activity in 2012 by third parties in formations containing natural gas liquids has led to a significant decline in the price of natural gas liquids. If we discover and produce significant amounts of natural gas liquids or oil, our results of operation may be adversely affected by downward fluctuations in natural gas liquids and oil prices.\nThe coal industry also faces concerns with respect to oversupply. Coal accounted for approximately 61% of our outside sales revenues from continuing operations in 2014. In 2013, our average sales price per ton of low volatile metallurgical coal fell by approximately 34% due to oversupply which was particularly acute in the international market. This trend continued in 2014 with metallurgical coal prices falling to six year lows and our average sales price of low volatile metallurgical coal further declined by another 22% from 2013\u2019s depressed price.\nApart from issues with respect to the supply of products we produce, demand can fluctuate widely due to a number of matters beyond our control including:\n\u2022\nchanges in the consumption pattern of industrial consumers, electricity generators and residential users;\n\u2022\nweather conditions in our markets which affect the demand for natural gas and thermal coal (for example, the unusually warm 2011 - 2012 winter left utilities with large coal stockpiles and depressed the demand for thermal coal);\n\u2022\nproximity and capacity of gas pipelines and other transportation facilities;\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels, especially thermal coal; the price and supply of imported liquefied natural gas; and\n\u2022\nincreased utilization by the steel industry of electric arc furnaces or pulverized coal processes to make steel which do not use furnace coke, an intermediate product produced from metallurgical coal, decreases the demand for metallurgical coal.\nForeign currency fluctuations could adversely affect the competitiveness of our coal abroad.\nWe compete in international markets against coal produced in other countries. Coal is sold internationally in U.S. dollars. As a result, mining costs in competing producing countries may be reduced in U.S. dollar terms based on currency exchange rates, providing an advantage to foreign coal producers. We also expect in the future that an international market will develop for exporting domestic natural gas and natural gas liquids. Currency fluctuations among countries purchasing and selling coal could adversely affect the competitiveness of our coal in international markets.\nIf coal customers do not extend existing contracts or do not enter into new long-term coal contracts, profitability of CONSOL Energy's operations could be affected.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, approximately 66% of the coal CONSOL Energy produced from continued operations was sold under long-term contracts (contracts with terms of one year or more). If a substantial portion of CONSOL Energy's long-term contracts are modified or terminated or if force majeure is exercised, CONSOL Energy would be adversely affected if we are unable to replace the contracts or if new contracts are not at the same level of profitability. If existing\ncustomers do not honor current contract commitments, our revenue would be adversely affected. The profitability of our long-term coal supply contracts depends on a variety of factors, which vary from contract to contract and fluctuate during the contract term, including our production costs and other factors. Price changes, if any, provided in long-term supply contracts may not reflect our cost increases, and therefore, increases in our costs may reduce our profit margins. In addition, in periods of declining market prices, provisions in our long-term coal contracts for adjustment or renegotiation of prices and other provisions may increase our exposure to short-term coal price volatility. As a result, CONSOL Energy may not be able to obtain long-term agreements at favorable prices compared to either market conditions, as they may change from time to time, or our cost structure, and long-term contracts may not contribute to our profitability.\nThe loss of, or significant reduction in, purchases by our largest coal customers could adversely affect our revenues.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, we derived over 10% of our total revenues from sales to two coal customers individually and more than 30% of our total revenue from sales to our four largest coal and gas customers. At December 31, 2014, we had approximately 30 coal supply agreements with these customers that expire at various times from 2015 to 2018. We are currently discussing the extension of existing agreements or entering into new long-term agreements with some of these customers, but these negotiations may not be successful and these customers may not continue to purchase coal from us under long-term coal supply agreements. If any one of these customers were to significantly reduce their purchases of coal from us, or if we were unable to sell coal to them on terms as favorable to us as the terms under our current agreements, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer.\nOur ability to collect payments from our customers could be impaired if their creditworthiness declines or if they fail to honor their contracts with us.\nOur ability to receive payment for natural gas and coal sold and delivered depends on the continued creditworthiness of our customers. Some power plant owners may have credit ratings that are below investment grade. If the creditworthiness of our customers declines significantly, our $125 million accounts receivable securitization program and our business could be adversely affected. In addition, if customers refuse to accept shipments of our coal for which they have an existing contractual obligation, our revenues will decrease and we may have to reduce production at our mines until our customer's contractual obligations are honored.\nOur gas business depends on gathering, processing and transportation facilities owned by others and the disruption of, capacity constraints in, or proximity to pipeline systems could limit sales of our natural gas. Similarly, the availability and reliability of transportation facilities and fluctuations in transportation costs could affect the demand for our coal or impair our ability to supply coal to our customers.\nWe gather, process and transport our gas to market by utilizing pipelines and facilities owned by others. If pipeline or facility capacity is limited, or if pipeline or facility capacity is unexpectedly disrupted for any reason, our gas sales and/or sales of natural gas liquids could be limited, reducing our profitability. If we cannot access processing pipeline transportation facilities, we may have to reduce our production of gas. If our sales of gas or natural gas liquids are reduced because of transportation or processing constraints, our revenues will be reduced, and our unit costs will also increase. If pipeline quality standards change, we might be required to install additional processing equipment which could increase our costs. The pipeline could also curtail our flows until the gas delivered to their pipeline is in compliance.\nCoal producers depend upon rail, barge, trucking, overland conveyor and other systems to provide access to markets. Disruption of transportation services because of weather-related problems, strikes, lock-outs, terrorist attacks or other events could temporarily impair our ability to supply coal to customers and adversely affect our profitability. Transportation costs represent a significant portion of the delivered cost of coal and, as a result, the cost of delivery is a critical factor in a customer's purchasing decision. Increases in transportation costs could make our coal less competitive.\nCompetition within the natural gas and coal industries may adversely affect our ability to sell our products. Increased competition or a loss of our competitive position could adversely affect our sales of, or our prices for, our natural gas and coal products, which could impair our profitability.\nThe gas industry is intensely competitive with companies from various regions of the United States. We compete with these companies and we may compete with foreign companies for domestic sales. Many of the companies we compete with are larger and have greater financial, technological, human and other resources. If we are unable to compete, our company, our operating results and financial position may be adversely affected. In addition, larger companies may be able to pay more to\nacquire new gas properties for future exploration, limiting our ability to replace natural gas we produce or to grow our production. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover new natural gas resources also depends on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate these transactions in a highly competitive environment.\nCONSOL Energy competes with coal producers in various regions of the United States and with some foreign coal producers for domestic sales primarily to electric power generators. CONSOL Energy also competes with both domestic and foreign coal producers for sales in international markets. Demand for our coal by our principal customers is affected by the delivered price of competing coals, other fuel supplies and alternative generating sources, including nuclear, natural gas, oil and renewable energy sources, such as hydroelectric and wind power. CONSOL Energy sells coal to foreign electricity generators and to the more specialized metallurgical coal market, both of which are significantly affected by international demand and competition. Increases in coal prices could encourage existing producers to expand capacity or could encourage new producers to enter the market. If overcapacity results, prices could fall or we may not be able to sell our coal, which would reduce revenue.\nThe characteristics of coal may make it costly for electric power generators and other coal users to comply with various environmental standards regarding the emissions of impurities released when coal is burned which could cause utilities to replace coal-fired power plants with alternative fuels. In addition, various incentives have been proposed to encourage the generation of electricity from renewable energy sources. A reduction in the use of coal for electric power generation could decrease the volume of our domestic coal sales and adversely affect our results of operations.\nCoal contains impurities, including sulfur, mercury, and other constituents, many of which are released into the air along with fine particulate matter and carbon dioxide when coal is burned. Environmental regulations governing emissions from coal fired electric generating plants could affect demand for coal as a fuel source and affect volume of our sales. Complying with regulations on these emissions can be costly for electric power generators. For example, in order to meet the federal Clean Air Act limits for sulfur dioxide emissions from electric power plants, coal users would either need to install and operate advanced air pollution control equipment, purchase emission allowances, or switch to other fuels. Each option has limitations. Lower sulfur coal may be more costly to purchase on an energy basis than higher sulfur coal depending on mining and transportation costs. Switching to other fuels may require expensive modification of existing plants. Because higher sulfur coal currently accounts for a significant portion of our sales, the extent to which electric power generators switch to alternative fuel could materially affect us. In the last two years the U.S. EPA promulgated or finalized several rulemakings impacting coal generating facilities. These include the Utility Maximum Control Technology (UMACT) rule which includes more stringent emission limits for particulate matter (PM), SO2 and NOX; and the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) rule which set new mercury and air toxic standards. Additionally, litigation staying implementation of EPA\u2019s Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) was finalized and the rule went into effect in October 2014 with Phase 1 implementation scheduled for 2015 and Phase 2 beginning in 2017. In late 2014, the EPA also proposed to lower the primary and secondary standard National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone which could have a large impact on the fossil fuel industry.\nIn December 2014, the EPA resolved the uncertainty that surrounded the future management of coal combustion residuals (CCR), also known as coal ash, produced from the combustion of coal in coal-fired electric generating units and finalized rules requiring the management of CCRs pursuant to the solid waste provisions (Subtitle D) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and not under the hazardous waste provisions (Subtitle C).\nFinally, in May 2014, the EPA finalized standards under Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) to reduce the injury and death of fish and other aquatic life caused by cooling-water intake structures at existing power plants, including coal- and natural gas-fired power plants. These national requirements will be implemented through facility permits pursuant to the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES),\nApart from actual and potential regulation of emissions, waste water, and solid wastes from coal-fired plants, state and federal mandates for increased use of electricity from renewable energy sources could have an impact on the market for our coal. Several states have enacted legislative mandates requiring electricity suppliers to use renewable energy sources to generate a certain percentage of power. There have been numerous proposals to establish a similar uniform, national standard although none of these proposals have been enacted to date. Possible advances in technologies and incentives, such as tax credits, to enhance the economics of renewable energy sources could make these sources more competitive with coal. Any reductions in the amount of coal consumed by domestic electric power generators as a result of current or new standards for the emission of impurities or incentives to switch to alternative fuels or renewable energy sources could reduce the demand for our coal, thereby reducing our revenues and adversely affecting our business and results of operations.\nRegulation of greenhouse gas emissions as well as uncertainty concerning such regulation could adversely impact the market for natural gas and coal and the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions may increase our operating costs and reduce the value of our natural gas and coal assets.\nWhile climate change legislation in the U.S. is unlikely in the next several years, the issue of global climate change continues to attract considerable public and scientific attention with widespread concern about the impacts of human activity, especially the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as carbon dioxide and methane. Combustion of fossil fuels, such as the natural gas and coal we produce, results in the creation of carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere by natural gas and coal end-users, such as coal-fired electric power generation plants. Numerous proposals have been made and are likely to continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government that are intended to limit emissions of GHGs. Several states have already adopted measures requiring reduction of GHGs within state boundaries. Other states have elected to participate in voluntary regional cap-and-trade programs like the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) in the northeastern U.S. Internationally, the Kyoto Protocol, which set binding emission targets for developed countries (but has not been ratified by the United States, and Canada officially withdrew from its Kyoto commitment in 2012) was nominally extended past its expiration date of December 2012 with a requirement for a new legal construct to be put into place by 2015. The EPA has elected to regulate GHGs under the Clean Air Act.\nNew rules governing carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel powered electric generating plants were proposed in 2013 and 2014, including a New Source Performance Standard (NSPS) for new fossil fuel fired power plants and the Clean Power Plan, respectively, to cut carbon emissions from existing power plants. The EPA estimates that by 2030, the rule will achieve a 30% reduction in CO2 emissions from the U.S. electric power sector from 2005 levels and will reduce coal consumption for electricity generation by about 27% relative to the base case (i.e., relative to what it would be in the absence of the regulation), and will reduce mine-mouth coal prices by about 15% relative to the base case.\nApart from governmental regulation, on February 4, 2008, three of Wall Street\u2019s largest investment banks announced that they had adopted climate change guidelines. The guidelines require the evaluation of carbon risks in the financing of electric power generation plants which may make it more difficult for utilities to obtain financing for coal-fired plants.\nAdoption of comprehensive legislation or regulation focusing on GHGs emission reductions for the United States (including the proposed rules discussed above) or other countries where we sell coal, or the inability of utilities to obtain financing in connection with coal-fired plants, may make it more costly to operate fossil fuel fired (especially coal-fired) electric power generation plants and make fossil fuels less attractive for electric utility power plants in the future. Depending on the nature of the regulation or legislation, natural gas-fueled power generation could become more economically attractive than coal-fueled power generation, substantially increasing the demand for natural gas. Apart from actual regulation, uncertainty over the extent of regulation of GHG emissions may inhibit utilities from investing in the building of new coal-fired plants to replace older plants or investing in the upgrading of existing coal-fired plants. Any reduction in the amount of coal or possibly natural gas consumed by domestic electric power generators as a result of actual or potential regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could decrease demand for our fossil fuels, thereby reducing our revenues and materially and adversely affecting our business and results of operations. We or our customers may also have to invest in carbon dioxide capture and storage technologies in order to burn coal or natural gas and comply with future GHG emission standards.\nIn addition, coalbed methane must be expelled from our underground coal mines for mining safety reasons. Coalbed methane has a greater GHG effect than carbon dioxide. Our natural gas operations capture coalbed methane from our underground coal mines, although some coalbed methane is vented into the atmosphere when the coal is mined. If regulation of GHG emissions does not exempt the release of coalbed methane, we may have to further reduce our methane emissions, pay higher taxes, incur costs to purchase credits that permit us to continue operations as they now exist at our underground coal mines or perhaps curtail coal production.\nOur natural gas and coal mining operations are subject to operating risks, including our reliance upon third party contractors, which could increase our operating expenses and decrease our production levels which could adversely affect our results of operations. Our natural gas and coal operations are also subject to hazards and any losses or liabilities we suffer from hazards which occur in our operations may not be fully covered by our insurance policies.\nOur exploration for and production of natural gas involves numerous operating risks. The cost of drilling, completing and operating our shale gas wells, shallow oil and gas wells and coalbed methane (CBM) wells is often uncertain, and a number of factors can delay or prevent drilling operations, decrease production and/or increase the cost of our gas operations at particular sites for varying lengths of time thereby adversely affecting our operating results. The operating risks that may have a significant impact on our gas operations include:\n\u2022\nunexpected drilling conditions;\n\u2022\ntitle problems;\n\u2022\npressure or irregularities in geologic formations;\n\u2022\nequipment failures or repairs;\n\u2022\nfires, explosions or other accidents;\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions;\n\u2022\nreductions in natural gas prices;\n\u2022\nsecurity breaches or terroristic acts;\n\u2022\npipeline ruptures;\n\u2022\nlack of adequate capacity for treatment or disposal of waste water generated in drilling, completion and production operations;\n\u2022\nenvironmental contamination from surface spillage of fluids used in well drilling, completion or operation including fracturing fluids used in hydraulic fracturing of wells, or other contamination of groundwater or the environment resulting from our use of such fluids; and\n\u2022\nunavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, other field services and equipment.\nOur coal mining operations are predominantly underground mines. These mines are subject to a number of operating risks that could disrupt operations, decrease production and increase the cost of mining at particular mines for varying lengths of time thereby adversely affecting our operating results. In addition, if coal production declines, we may not be able to produce sufficient amounts of coal to deliver under our long-term coal contracts. CONSOL Energy's inability to satisfy contractual obligations could result in our customers initiating claims against us. The operating risks that may have a significant impact on our coal operations include:\n\u2022\nvariations in thickness of the layer, or seam, of coal;\n\u2022\namounts of rock and other natural materials intruding into the coal seam and other geological conditions that could affect the stability of the roof and the side walls of the mine;\n\u2022\nequipment failures or repairs;\n\u2022\nfires, explosions or other accidents;\n\u2022\nweather conditions; and\n\u2022\nsecurity breaches or terroristic acts.\nAlthough we maintain insurance for a number of hazards, we may not be insured or fully insured against the losses or liabilities that could arise from a significant accident in our gas or coal operations.\nWe also rely upon third party contractors to provide key services to our gas operations. We contract with third parties for well services, related equipment, and qualified experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct field operations. The demand for these field services in the natural gas and oil industry can fluctuate significantly. Higher oil and natural gas prices generally stimulate increased demand causing periodic shortages. These shortages may lead to escalating prices for drilling equipment, crews and associated supplies, equipment and services. Shortages may lead to poor service and inefficient drilling operations and increase the possibility of accidents due to the hiring of inexperienced personnel and overuse of equipment by contractors. In addition, the costs and delivery times of equipment and supplies are substantially greater in periods of peak demand. Accordingly, we cannot assure that we will be able to obtain necessary drilling equipment and supplies in a timely manner or on satisfactory terms, and we may experience shortages of, or increases in the costs of, drilling equipment, crews and associated supplies, equipment and field services in the future. We utilize third-party contractors to provide land acquisition and related services to support our land operational needs for both gas and coal segments. We also use third party contractors to provide construction and specialized services to our mining operations. A decrease in the availability of field services or equipment and supplies, an increase in the prices charged for field services, equipment and supplies, or the failure of third party contractors to provide quality field services to us, could decrease our gas and coal production, increase our costs of gas and coal production, and decrease our anticipated profitability.\nWe attempt to mitigate the risks involved with increased industrial activity by entering into \u201ctake or pay\u201d contracts with well service providers which commit them to provide field services to us at specified levels and commit us to pay for field services at specified levels even if we do not use those services. However, these contracts expose us to economic risk. For example, if the price of natural gas declines and it is not economical to drill and produce additional natural gas, we may have to pay for field services that we did not use. This would decrease our cash flow and raise our costs of production.\nA decrease in the availability or increase in the costs of commodities or capital equipment used in mining operations could decrease our coal production, impact our cost of coal production and decrease our anticipated profitability.\nCoal mining consumes large quantities of commodities including steel, copper, rubber products and liquid fuels and requires the use of capital equipment. Some commodities, such as steel, are needed to comply with roof control plans required by regulation. The prices we pay for commodities and capital equipment are strongly impacted by the global market. A rapid or significant increase in the costs of commodities or capital equipment we use in our operations could impact our mining operations costs because we may have a limited ability to negotiate lower prices, and, in some cases, may not have a ready substitute.\nFor drilling and mining operations, CONSOL Energy must obtain, maintain, and renew governmental permits and approvals which if we cannot obtain in a timely manner would reduce our production, cash flow and results of operations.\nState and local authorities regulate various aspects of gas drilling and production activities, including the drilling of wells (through permit and bonding requirements), the spacing of wells, the unitization or pooling of gas properties, environmental matters, safety standards, market sharing and well site restoration. Delays or denials of gas permits could reduce our production, cash flows and results of operations.\nMost coal producers in the eastern U.S. are being impacted by government regulations and enforcement to a much greater extent than a few years ago, particularly in light of the renewed focus by environmental agencies and the government generally on the mining industry, including more stringent enforcement and interpretation of the laws that regulate mining. The pace with which the government issues permits needed for new operations and for on-going operations to continue mining has negatively impacted expected production, especially in Central Appalachia. Environmental groups in Southern West Virginia and Kentucky have challenged state and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE) permits for mountaintop and other types of surface mining operations on various grounds. The most recent challenges have focused on the adequacy of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers analysis of impacts to streams and the adequacy of mitigation plans to compensate for stream impacts resulting from valley fill permits required for mountaintop mining. These challenges have also enhanced the EPA's oversight and involvement in the review of permits by state regulatory authorities. In 2011, the EPA revoked an ACOE-issued Section 404 permit to a mining operator. Following the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s refusal in March 2012 to hear an appeal from the D.C. Circuit Court\u2019s ruling upholding the EPA\u2019s power to revoke a permit, in September 2014 the U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the EPA\u2019s action to revoke the permit. In addition, in July 2014 the D.C Circuit reversed a lower court\u2019s decision and affirmed the EPA\u2019s authority to adopt the Enhanced Coordination Process governing coordination with the ACOE in the processing of CWA permits. The Court also rejected challenges to EPA\u2019s 2012 \u201cFinal Guidance\u201d document regarding appropriate permit conditions, namely those affecting acceptable conductivity limits (e.g., acceptable ionic strength to support aquatic life). However, the Court left it up to the states on whether to adopt the guideline recommendations when issuing final NPDES permits. This decision has left mining permits in some degree of uncertainty whether the EPA will concur with a state\u2019s draft permit conditions should they not contain specified limits regarding conductivity, further increasing operational uncertainty and costs.\nExisting and future government laws, regulations and other legal requirements relating to protection of the environment, and others that govern our business may increase our costs of doing business for coal and may restrict our coal operations.\nWe are subject to laws, regulations and other legal requirements enacted or adopted by federal, state and local authorities, as well as foreign authorities relating to protection of the environment. These include those legal requirements that govern discharges of substances into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the cleanup of contaminated sites, groundwater quality and availability, threatened and endangered plant and wildlife protection, reclamation and restoration of mining or drilling properties after mining or drilling is completed, the installation of various safety equipment in our mines, remediation of impacts of surface subsidence from underground mining, and work practices related to employee health and safety. Complying with these requirements, including the terms of our permits, has had, and will continue to have, a significant effect on our costs of operations and competitive position.\nIn addition, there is the possibility that we could incur substantial costs as a result of violations under environmental laws. Any additional laws, regulations and other legal requirements enacted or adopted by federal, state and local authorities, as well as foreign authorities or new interpretations of existing legal requirements by regulatory bodies relating to the protection of the environment could further affect our costs of operations and competitive position. The Clean Water Act is being used by opponents of mountain top removal mining as a means to challenge permits and bring citizen suits to make coal mining more expensive. At CONSOL Energy\u2019s Fola Mining Operations, six citizen suits have been filed challenging water discharge permits. Two of those suits were settled in 2014, and at least two are potentially affected by recent settlements by another mining operator in a similar case,\nExisting and future government laws, regulations and other legal requirements relating to protection of the environment, and others that govern our business may increase our costs of doing business for natural gas, and may restrict our gas operations.\nRegulations applicable to the gas industry are under constant review for amendment or expansion at the federal and state level. Any future changes may affect, among other things, the pricing or marketing of gas production. For example, hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons, particularly natural gas, from tight formations such as Marcellus Shale. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. The process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions. Hydraulic fracturing is currently exempt from regulation under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, except for hydraulic fracturing using diesel fuel. The disposal of produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes in underground injection disposal wells is regulated by the EPA under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act or by the states under counterpart state laws and regulations. The imposition of new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability to conduct hydraulic fracturing operations or to dispose of waste resulting from such operations. The EPA has commenced a study of the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities with a final report to be issued in 2015 along with stated accompanying regulation. EPA has also announced it will expand its CAA Subpart W regulations in 2015 to further address GHG and carbon dioxide emissions at wellheads and gathering facilities associated with natural gas production. Other federal agencies are also examining hydraulic fracturing, including the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the U.S. Government Accountability Office and the Department of the Interior. Also, some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict or impose additional requirements relating to hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances. If hydraulic fracturing is regulated at the federal, state or local level, our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permit requirements or operational restrictions and also to associated permitting delays and potential increases in costs.\nFurther, air emissions that stem from hydraulic fracturing and completions processes, as well as from midstream activities such as the gathering and transmission of natural gas, are regulated by federal and state rules. However, interpretations of those rules, as well as additional changes to the regulations, could negatively impact our ability to meet our stated production objectives for the company. For example, source aggregation of air emissions to determine whether, under the Clean Air Act a source comprises a single stationary source and is therefore a major source of air pollution, and thereby subject to the applicability of Nonattainment Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V permitting requirements, has and continues to be debated by the EPA, state regulatory agencies and the courts. Federal and state activities as well as court decisions could impact the development and transmission of plans of CONSOL, our joint venture partners, and gathering systems being installed and operated by CONE Midstream Partners, LP.\nAdditionally, some states have begun to adopt more stringent regulation and oversight of natural gas gathering lines than is currently required by federal standards. Pennsylvania, under Act 127, authorized the Public Utility Commission (PUC) oversight of Class I gathering lines, as well as requiring standards and fees associated with Class II and Class III pipelines. The state of Ohio also moved to regulate natural gas gathering lines in a similar manner pursuant to Ohio Senate Bill 315 (SB315). SB315 expanded the Ohio PUC's authority over rural natural gas gathering lines. These changes in interpretation and regulation affect CONSOL Energy's midstream activities, requiring changes in reporting as well as increased costs.\nFurther, some state and local governments in the Marcellus Shale region in Pennsylvania and New York have considered or imposed a temporary moratorium on drilling operations using hydraulic fracturing until further study of the potential for environmental and human health impacts by the EPA or the relevant agencies are completed. Further, states could elect to prohibit hydraulic fracturing altogether, as Governor Andrew Cuomo of the State of New York announced in December 2014 with regard to fracturing activities in New York. Also, a few municipalities in Colorado have adopted ordinances to ban hydraulic fracturing. No assurance can be given as to whether or not similar measures might be considered or implemented in jurisdictions in which our gas properties are located. If new laws or regulations that significantly restrict or otherwise impact hydraulic fracturing are passed by Congress or adopted in states in which we operate, such legal requirements could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform hydraulic fracturing activities and thereby could affect the determination of whether a well is commercially viable. New laws or regulations could also cause delays or interruptions or terminations of operations, the extent of which cannot be predicted, and could reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we ultimately are able to produce in commercially paying quantities from our gas properties, all of which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur shale gas drilling and production operations require both adequate sources of water to use in the fracturing process as well as the ability to dispose of water and other wastes after hydraulic fracturing. Our CBM gas drilling\nand production operations also require the removal and disposal of water from the coal seams from which we produce gas. If we cannot find adequate sources of water for our use or are unable to dispose of the water we use or remove it from the strata at a reasonable cost and within applicable environmental rules, our ability to produce gas economically and in commercial quantities could be impaired.\nAs part of our drilling and production in shale formations, we use hydraulic fracturing processes. Thus, we need access to adequate sources of water to use in our shale operations. Further, we must remove and dispose of the portion of the water that we use to fracture our shale gas wells that flows back to the well-bore as well as drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of natural gas. In addition, in our CBM drilling and production, coal seams frequently contain water that must be removed and disposed of in order for the gas to detach from the coal and flow to the well bore. Our inability to locate sufficient amounts of water with respect to our shale operations, or the inability to dispose of or recycle water and other wastes used in our shale and our CBM operations, could adversely impact our operations. For example, in Ohio, underground injection of gas well production fluids was temporarily suspended for underground injection disposal wells near Youngstown while regulatory authorities investigated whether injection of wastewater into the wells was causing low category earthquakes in the area.\nOur mines are subject to stringent federal and state safety regulations that increase our cost of doing business at active operations and may place restrictions on our methods of operation. In addition, government inspectors under certain circumstances, have the ability to order our operations to be shutdown based on safety considerations. A mine could be shutdown for an extended period of time if a disaster were to occur at it.\nStringent health and safety standards were imposed by federal legislation when the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969 was adopted. The Federal Coal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 expanded the enforcement of safety and health standards of the Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969 and imposed safety and health standards on all (non-coal as well as coal) mining operations. Regulations are comprehensive and affect numerous aspects of mining operations, including training of mine personnel, mining procedures, the equipment used in mine emergency procedures, mine plans and other matters. The additional requirements of the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006 (the Miner Act) and implementing federal regulations include, among other things, expanded emergency response plans, providing additional quantities of breathable air for emergencies, installation of refuge chambers in underground coal mines, installation of two-way communications and tracking systems for underground coal mines, new standards for sealing mined out areas of underground coal mines, more available mine rescue teams and enhanced training for emergencies. Most states in which CONSOL Energy operates have programs for mine safety and health regulation and enforcement. We believe that the combination of federal and state safety and health regulations in the coal mining industry is, perhaps, the most comprehensive system for protection of employee safety and health affecting any industry. Most aspects of mine operations, particularly underground mine operations, are subject to extensive regulation. The various requirements mandated by law or regulation can place restrictions on our methods of operations, creating a significant effect on operating costs and productivity. In addition, government inspectors under certain circumstances, have the ability to order our operation to be shutdown based on safety considerations. If a disaster were to occur at one of our mines, it could be shutdown for an extended period of time and our reputation with our customers could be materially damaged.\nOur operations may impact the environment or cause exposure to hazardous substances, and our properties may have environmental contamination, which could result in liabilities to us.\nOur operations currently use hazardous materials and generate limited quantities of hazardous wastes from time to time. Drainage flowing from or caused by mining activities can be acidic with elevated levels of dissolved metals, a condition referred to as \u201cacid mine drainage.\u201d We could become subject to claims for toxic torts, natural resource damages and other damages as well as for the investigation and clean-up of soil, surface water, groundwater, and other media. Such claims may arise, for example, out of conditions at sites that we currently own or operate, as well as at sites that we previously owned or operated, or may acquire. Our liability for such claims may be joint and several, so that we may be held responsible for more than our share of the contamination or other damages, or for the entire share.\nWe maintain extensive coal refuse areas and slurry impoundments at a number of our mining complexes. Such areas and impoundments are subject to extensive regulation. Structural failure of a slurry impoundment or coal refuse area could result in extensive damage to the environment and natural resources, such as bodies of water that the coal slurry reaches, as well as liability for related personal injuries and property damages, and injuries to wildlife. Some of our impoundments overlie mined out areas, which can pose a heightened risk of failure and of damages arising out of failure. If one of our impoundments were to fail, we could be subject to claims for the resulting environmental contamination and associated liability, as well as for fines and penalties. Our coal refuse areas and slurry impoundments are designed, constructed, and inspected by our company and by regulatory authorities according to stringent environmental and safety standards.\nIn West Virginia there are areas where drainage from coal mining operations contains concentrations of selenium that without treatment would result in violations of state water quality standards that are set to protect fish and other aquatic life. CONSOL Energy has several operations with selenium discharges. CONSOL Energy and other coal companies have worked to expeditiously develop cost effective means to remove selenium from mine water.\nThese and other similar unforeseen impacts that our operations may have on the environment, as well as exposures to hazardous substances or wastes associated with our operations, could result in costs and liabilities that could adversely affect us. An example of this is Naturally Occurring Radioactive Material (NORM) or Technologically-Enhanced, Naturally Occurring Radioactive Material (TENORM). NORM or TENORM is produced when activities such as deep drilling concentrate or expose radioactive materials that occur naturally in ores, soils, water, or other natural materials. State and federal agencies are examining the possibility for worker exposure or associated environmental hazards due to processing and disposal of wastes containing NORM or TENORM. CONSOL Energy's operations could be affected if there is a hazard associated with NORM/TENORM or if it were to be regulated in such a way as to require expensive treatment and disposal options.\nCONSOL Energy has reclamation, mine closing and gas well plugging obligations. If the assumptions underlying our accruals are inaccurate, we could be required to expend greater amounts than anticipated.\nThe Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act establishes operational, reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining as well as most aspects of deep mining. Also, state laws require us to plug gas wells and reclaim well sites after the useful life of our gas wells has ended. CONSOL Energy accrues for the costs of current mine disturbance, gas well plugging and of final mine closure, including the cost of treating mine water discharge where necessary. Estimates of our total reclamation, mine-closing liabilities and gas well plugging, which are based upon permit requirements and our experience, were approximately $576 million at December 31, 2014. The amounts recorded are dependent upon a number of variables, including the estimated future closure costs, estimated proven reserves, assumptions involving profit margins, inflation rates, and the assumed credit-adjusted risk-free interest rates. Furthermore, these obligations are unfunded. If these accruals are insufficient or our liability in a particular year is greater than currently anticipated, our future operating results could be adversely affected.\nMost states where we operate require us to post bonds for the full cost of coal mine reclamation (full cost bonding). West Virginia is not a full cost bonding state. West Virginia has an alternative bond system (ABS) for coal mine reclamation which consists of (i) individual site bonds posted by the permittee that are less than the full estimated reclamation cost plus (ii) a bond pool (Special Reclamation Fund) funded by a per ton fee on coal mined in the State which is used to supplement the site specific bonds if needed in the event of bond forfeiture. The Special Reclamation Fund was underfunded, resulting in a citizen suit before the U.S. District Court in West Virginia. In an effort to settle the issue in 2012, the WV legislature authorized an increase in the per ton fee levied on coal production to make up the shortfall. There remains the possibility that WV may move to full cost bonding in the future which could cause individual mining companies and/or surety companies to exceed bonding capacity and would result in the need to post cash bonds or letters of credit which would reduce operating capital. Pennsylvania is expanding its full cost bonding program to cover all coal mine bonding, further increasing the amount of surety bonds CONSOL Energy must seek in order to permit its mining activities.\nWe face uncertainties in estimating our economically recoverable natural gas, oil and coal reserves, and inaccuracies in our estimates could result in lower than expected revenues, higher than expected costs and decreased profitability.\nNatural gas and oil reserves require subjective estimates of underground accumulations of natural gas and oil and assumptions concerning natural gas and oil prices, production levels, reserve estimates and operating and development costs. As a result, estimated quantities of proved natural gas and oil reserves and projections of future production rates and the timing of development expenditures may be incorrect. For example, a significant amount of our proved undeveloped reserves extensions and discoveries during the last three years were due to the addition of wells on our Marcellus Shale acreage more than one offset location away from existing production with reliable technology, which may be more susceptible to positive and negative changes in reserve estimates than our proved developed reserves. Over time, material changes to reserve estimates may be made, taking into account the results of actual drilling, testing and production. Also, we make certain assumptions regarding natural gas and oil prices, production levels, and operating and development costs that may prove incorrect. Any significant variance from these assumptions to actual figures could greatly affect our estimates of our natural gas reserves, the economically recoverable quantities of natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties, the classifications of natural gas and oil reserves based on risk of recovery, and estimates of the future net cash flows. Numerous changes over time to the assumptions on which our reserve estimates are based, as described above, often result in the actual quantities of natural gas we ultimately recover being different from reserve estimates. The present value of future net cash flows from our proved\nreserves is not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated natural gas reserves. We base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved natural gas reserves on historical average prices and costs. However, actual future net cash flows from our natural gas and oil properties also will be affected by factors such as:\n\u2022\ngeological conditions;\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulations and taxation;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of actual production;\n\u2022\nassumptions governing future prices;\n\u2022\nfuture operating costs; and\n\u2022\ncapital costs of drilling, completion and gathering assets.\nThe timing of both our production and our incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of natural gas and oil properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves, and thus their actual present value. In addition, the 10% discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the natural gas and oil industry in general. If natural gas prices decline by $0.10 per Mcf, then the pre-tax present value using a 10% discount rate of our proved natural gas reserves as of December 31, 2014 would decrease from $4.9 billion to $4.7 billion.\nSimilarly, there are uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of economically recoverable coal reserves, including many factors beyond our control. As a result, estimates of economically recoverable coal reserves are by their nature uncertain. Information about our reserves consists of estimates based on engineering, economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by our staff. Some of the factors and assumptions which impact economically recoverable coal reserve estimates include:\n\u2022 geologic conditions;\n\u2022 historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas;\n\u2022 the assumed effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies;\n\u2022 assumptions governing future prices; and\n\u2022 future operating costs, including the cost of materials.\nIn addition, we hold substantial coal reserves in areas containing Marcellus Shale and other shales. These areas are currently the subject of substantial exploration for oil and natural gas, particularly by horizontal drilling. If a well is in the path of our mining for coal, we may not be able to mine through the well unless we purchase it. Although in the past we have purchased vertical wells, the cost of purchasing a producing horizontal well could be substantially greater. Horizontal wells with multiple laterals extending from the well pad may access larger oil and natural gas reserves than a vertical well which could result in higher costs. In future years, the cost associated with purchasing oil and natural gas wells which are in the path of our coal mining may make mining through those wells uneconomical thereby effectively causing a loss of significant portions of our coal reserves.\nEach of the factors which impacts reserve estimation may in fact vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating the reserves. For these reasons, estimates of natural gas and coal reserves may vary substantially. Actual production, revenues and expenditures with respect to our coal and natural gas reserves will likely vary from estimates, and these variances may be material. As a result, our estimates may not accurately reflect our actual coal and natural gas reserves.\nDefects may exist in our chain of title for our gas estate and we have not done a thorough chain of title examination of our gas estate. We may incur additional costs and delays to produce gas because we have to acquire additional property rights to perfect our title to gas rights. If we fail to acquire additional property rights to perfect our title to gas rights, we may have to reduce our estimated reserves.\nSubstantial amounts of acreage in which we believe we control gas rights are in areas where we have not yet done a thorough chain of title examination of the gas estate. A number of our gas properties were acquired primarily for the coal rights with the focus on the coal estate title, and, in many cases were acquired years ago. In addition, we have acquired gas rights in substantial acreage from third parties who had not performed thorough chain of title work on their gas properties. Our practice, and we believe industry practice, is not to perform a thorough title examination on gas properties until shortly before the commencement of drilling activities at which time we seek to acquire any additional rights needed to perfect our ownership of the gas estate for development and production purposes. When we perform a thorough chain of title examination, we may discover material defects in our title which would require us to acquire additional property rights. We may incur substantial costs to acquire these additional property rights. In addition, the acquisition of the necessary rights may not be feasible in some\ncases. Our discovering of title defects which we are unable to cure may adversely impact our ability to develop those properties and we may have to reduce our estimated gas reserves including our proved undeveloped reserves.\nSome states (West Virginia and Virginia) permit us to produce coalbed methane gas without perfected ownership under an administrative process known as \u201cpooling,\u201d which requires us to give notice to all potential claimants and pay royalties into escrow until the undetermined rights are resolved. As a result, we may have to pay royalties to produce coalbed methane gas on acreage that we control and these costs may be material. Further, the pooling process is time-consuming and may delay our drilling program in the affected areas.\nCONSOL Energy and its subsidiaries are subject to various legal proceedings, which may have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe are party to a number of legal proceedings in the normal course of business activities. Defending these actions, especially purported class actions, can be costly, and can distract management. For example, we are a defendant in three pending purported class action lawsuits dealing with claimants\u2019 entitlement to, and accounting for, gas royalties. There is the potential that the costs of defending litigation in an individual matter or the aggregation of many matters could have an adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations or financial position. See Note 24 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities in the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of pending legal proceedings.\nCONSOL Energy has obligations for long-term employee benefits for which we accrue based upon assumptions which, if inaccurate, could result in CONSOL Energy being required to expense greater amounts than anticipated.\nCONSOL Energy provides various long-term employee benefits to inactive and retired employees. We accrue amounts for these obligations. At December 31, 2014, the current and non-current portions of these obligations included:\n\u2022\npostretirement medical and life insurance ($761 million);\n\u2022\ncoal workers' black lung benefits ($126 million);\n\u2022\nsalaried retirement benefits ($119 million); and\n\u2022\nworkers' compensation ($90 million).\nHowever, if our assumptions are inaccurate, we could be required to expend greater amounts than anticipated. Salary retirement benefits are funded in accordance with Employer Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) regulations. The other obligations are unfunded. In addition, the federal government and several states in which we operate consider changes in workers' compensation and black lung laws from time to time. Such changes, if enacted, could increase our benefit expense.\nIf lump sum payments made to retiring salaried employees pursuant to CONSOL Energy's defined benefit pension plan exceed the total of the service cost and the interest cost in a plan year, CONSOL Energy would need to make an adjustment to operating results equaling the unrecognized actuarial gain or loss resulting from each individual who received a lump sum payment in that year, which may result in an adjustment that could reduce operating results.\nCONSOL Energy's defined benefit pension plan for salaried employees allows such employees to receive a lump-sum distribution for benefits earned up through December 31, 2005 in lieu of annual payments when they retire from CONSOL Energy. Employers' Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans for Terminations Benefits requires that if the lump-sum distributions made for a plan year exceed the total of the service cost and interest cost for the plan year, CONSOL Energy would need to recognize for that year's results of operations an adjustment equaling the unrecognized actuarial gain or loss resulting from each individual who received a lump sum in that year. If the settlement is triggered in future periods, it may be material to operating results.\nAcquisitions that we have completed, acquisitions that we may undertake in the future, as well as expanding existing company mines, involve a number of risks, any of which could cause us not to realize the anticipated benefits and to the extent we plan to engage in joint ventures and divestitures, we do not control the timing of these and they may not provide anticipated benefits.\nWe have completed several acquisitions and investments in the past. We also continually seek to grow our business by adding and developing gas and coal reserves through acquisitions and by expanding the production at existing mines and\nexisting gas operations. If we are unable to successfully integrate the companies, businesses or properties we acquire, we may fail to realize the expected benefits of the acquisition and our profitability may decline and we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Acquisitions, mine expansion and gas operation expansion involve various inherent risks, including:\n\u2022\nuncertainties in assessing the value, strengths, and potential profitability of, and identifying the extent of all weaknesses, risks, contingent and other liabilities (including environmental liabilities) of expansion and acquisition opportunities\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key customers, management and employees of an acquired business;\n\u2022\nthe ability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies anticipated to result from an expansion or an acquisition opportunity:\n\u2022\nthe potential revision of assumptions regarding gas reserves as we acquire more knowledge by operating an acquired gas business:\n\u2022\nproblems that could arise from the integration of the acquired business;\n\u2022\nunanticipated changes in business, industry or general economic conditions that affect the assumptions underlying our rationale for pursuing the expansion or the acquisition opportunity; and\n\u2022\nwe may have to assume cleanup or reclamation obligations or other unanticipated liabilities in connection with these acquisitions.\nFrom time to time part of our business and financing plans include entering into joint venture arrangements and the divestiture of certain assets. However, we do not control the timing of divestitures or joint venture arrangements and delays in entering into divestitures or joint venture arrangements may reduce the benefits from them. In addition, the terms of divestitures and joint venture arrangements may cause a substantial portion of the benefits we anticipate receiving from them to be subject to future matters that we do not control.\nWe have entered into two significant natural gas joint ventures. These joint ventures restrict our operational and corporate flexibility; actions taken by our joint venture partners may materially impact our financial position and results of operations; and we may not realize the benefits we expect to realize from these joint ventures.\nIn the second half of 2011, we, through our principal gas operations subsidiary, CNX Gas, entered into joint venture arrangements with Noble Energy, Inc. and with a subsidiary of Hess Corporation, regarding our shale gas assets. We sold a 50% undivided interest in certain of our Marcellus shale oil and natural gas assets to Noble Energy and a 50% undivided interest in certain of our Utica shale acres in Ohio to Hess. The following aspects of these joint ventures could materially impact us:\nThe development of these properties is subject to the terms of our joint development agreements with these parties and we no longer have the flexibility to control completely the development of these properties. For example, the joint development agreements for each of these joint ventures sets forth required capital expenditure programs that each party must participate in unless the parties mutually agree to change such programs or, in certain limited circumstances in the case of the Noble Energy joint development agreement, a party elects to exercise a non-consent right with respect to an entire year. If we do not timely meet our financial commitments under the respective joint development agreements, our rights to participate in such joint ventures will be adversely affected and the other parties to the joint ventures may have a right to acquire a share of our interest in such joint ventures proportionate to, and in satisfaction of, our unmet financial obligations. In addition, each joint venture party has the right to elect to participate in all acreage and other acquisitions in certain defined areas of mutual interest.\nEach joint development agreement assigns to each party designated areas over which that party will manage and control operations. We could incur liability as a result of action taken by one of our joint venture partners.\nOne of the potential benefits of these two joint ventures is the obligation of the other party to pay a portion of our share of drilling and development costs for new wells, which we called \"carried costs.\" At December 31, 2014, the remaining carried costs obligation of Noble Energy was approximately $1.63 billion while Hess' remaining carried costs obligation was approximately $99 million. Thus, the benefits we anticipate receiving in the joint ventures depend in part upon the rate at which new wells are drilled and developed in each joint venture, which could fluctuate significantly from period to period. Moreover, the performance of these third party obligations is outside our control. The inability or failure of our joint venture partners to pay their portion of development costs, including our carried costs during the carry period, could increase our costs of operations or result in reduced drilling and production of oil and natural gas or loss of rights to develop the oil and natural gas properties held by that joint venture.\nNoble Energy's obligation to pay carried costs is suspended if average Henry Hub natural gas prices fall and remain below $4.00 per million British thermal units or \u201cMMbtu\u201d in any three consecutive month period and will remain suspended until average natural gas prices are above $4.00/MMbtu for three consecutive months. As a result of this provision, Noble Energy's obligation to pay carried costs was suspended from December 1, 2011 to March 1, 2014 and was again suspended on November 1, 2014. We cannot predict when this latest suspension will be lifted and Noble Energy's obligation to pay the carried costs will resume. This suspension has the effect of requiring us to incur our entire 50 percent share of the drilling and completion costs for new wells during the suspension period and delaying receipt of a portion of the value we expect to receive in the transaction.\nThe Hess joint development agreement provides that any transfer of interest in the joint venture by us or Hess will be subject to a right of first offer in favor of the other party. These restrictions may preclude transactions which could be beneficial to our shareholders.\nDisputes between us and our joint venture partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses, delay or terminate projects and distract our officers and directors from focusing their time and effort on our business.\nWe may also enter into other joint venture arrangements in the future which could pose risks similar to risks described above.\nThe provisions of our debt agreements and the risks associated with our debt could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our total indebtedness was approximately $3.29 billion of which approximately $1.85 billion was under our 5.875% senior unsecured notes due 2022 plus $7 million of unamortized bond premium, $1.02 billion was under our 8.250% senior unsecured notes due 2020, $250 million was under our 6.375% senior notes due 2021, $103 million was under our Maryland Economic Development Corporation Port Facilities Refunding Revenue Bonds (MEDCO) 5.75% revenue bonds due September 2025, $47 million of capitalized leases due through 2021, and $17 million of miscellaneous debt. The degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of interest and principal due under our outstanding debt, which will limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, development of our gas and coal reserves or other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and in the coal and gas industries;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with lower leverage and better access to capital resources; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to implement our business strategy, including the structuring and formation of a master limited partnership for our thermal coal business and a subsidiary entity for the purpose of owning the metallurgical coal properties and related mining operations.\nOur senior secured credit facility and the indentures governing our 5.875%, 8.250% and 6.375% senior unsecured notes limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness unless specified tests or exceptions are met. In addition, our senior secured credit agreement and the indentures governing our 5.875%, 8.250% and 6.375% senior unsecured notes subject us to financial and/or other restrictive covenants. Under our senior secured credit agreement, we must comply with certain financial covenants on a quarterly basis including a minimum interest coverage ratio, and a minimum current ratio, as defined therein. Our senior secured credit agreement and the indentures governing our 5.875%, 8.250% and 6.375% senior unsecured notes impose a number of restrictions upon us, such as restrictions on granting liens on our assets, making investments, paying dividends, stock repurchases, selling assets and engaging in acquisitions. Failure by us to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could have an adverse effect on us.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to sell assets, seek additional capital or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations. Our senior secured credit agreement and the indentures governing our 5.875%, 8.250% and 6.375% senior unsecured notes restrict our ability to sell assets and use the proceeds from the sales. We may not be able to consummate those sales or to obtain the proceeds which we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.\nUnless we replace our gas and oil reserves, our gas and oil reserves and production will decline, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nProducing natural gas and oil reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Because total estimated proved reserves include our proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2014, production is expected to decline even if those proved undeveloped reserves are developed and the wells produce as expected. The rate of decline will change if production from our existing wells declines in a different manner than we have estimated and can change under other circumstances. Thus, our future natural gas and oil reserves and production and, therefore, our cash flow and income are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing and exploiting our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. We may not be able to develop, find or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs\nOur hedging activities may prevent us from benefiting from price increases and may expose us to other risks.\nTo manage our exposure to fluctuations in the price of natural gas, we enter into hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our expected production. As of January 15, 2015, we had hedges on approximately 121.2 Bcf of our 2015 natural gas production and 94.7 Bcf of our 2016 natural gas production. To the extent that we engage in hedging activities, we may be prevented from realizing the benefits of price increases above the levels of the hedges. If we choose not to engage in, or reduce our use of hedging arrangements in the future, we may be more adversely affected by changes in natural gas prices than our competitors who engage in hedging arrangements to a greater extent than we do.\nIn addition, such transactions may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which:\n\u2022\nour production is less than expected;\n\u2022\nthe counterparties to our contracts fail to perform the contracts; or\n\u2022\nthe creditworthiness of our counterparties or their guarantors is substantially impaired.\nChanges in federal or state income tax laws, particularly in the area of percentage depletion and intangible drilling costs, could cause our financial position and profitability to deteriorate.\nThe passage of legislation or any other similar changes in U.S. federal income tax law could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to natural gas, oil or coal exploration and development. Any such change could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nFor example, in February 2012, the state legislature of Pennsylvania passed a new natural gas impact fee in Pennsylvania, where a substantial portion of our acreage in the Marcellus Shale is located. The legislation imposes an annual fee on natural gas and oil operators for each well drilled for a period of fifteen years. The fee is on a sliding scale set by the Public Utility Commission and is based on two factors: changes in the Consumer Price Index and the average New York Mercantile Exchange\u2019s natural gas prices from the last day of each month. The estimated total fees per well based on today\u2019s current natural gas price is between $240 thousand and $310 thousand over the 15 year period. The passage of this legislation increases the financial burden on our operations in the Marcellus Shale.\nStrategic determinations, including the allocation of capital and other resources to strategic opportunities, are challenging, and our failure to appropriately allocate capital and resources among our strategic opportunities may adversely affect our financial condition. Additionally, our development and exploration projects require substantial capital expenditures and if we fail to obtain required capital or financing on satisfactory terms, our natural gas reserves may decline.\nOur future growth prospects are dependent upon our ability to identify optimal strategies for our business. In developing our business plan, we considered allocating capital and other resources to various aspects of our businesses including well development (primarily drilling), reserve acquisitions, exploratory activity, coal development, corporate items and other alternatives. We also considered our likely sources of capital, including cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities. Notwithstanding the determinations made in the development of our business plan, business opportunities not previously identified periodically come to our attention, including possible acquisitions and dispositions. If we fail to identify optimal business strategies, or fail to optimize our capital investment and capital raising opportunities and the use of our other resources in furtherance of our business strategies, our financial condition and future\ngrowth may be adversely affected. Moreover, economic or other circumstances may change from those contemplated by our business plan, and our failure to recognize or respond to those changes may limit our ability to achieve our objectives.\nAs part of our strategic determinations, we expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in the development and acquisition of natural gas reserves. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient cash from operations, borrowing capacity under our credit facilities or the ability to raise additional funds in the capital markets. If cash flow generated by our operations or available borrowings under our credit facilities are not sufficient to meet our capital requirements, or we are unable to obtain additional financing, we could be required to curtail the pace of the development of our natural gas properties, which in turn could lead to a decline in our reserves and production, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny failure by Murray Energy to satisfy the liabilities it assumed from us, as well as to perform its obligations under various agreements whose performance by Murray Energy we guaranteed, or under various agreements with us, could materially increase our liabilities and materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nIn 2013, Murray Energy and its subsidiaries (Murray Energy) acquired approximately $2.4 billion of liabilities which had been reflected on our books. In addition to these assumed liabilities, (i) Murray Energy acquired our obligations under the multi-employer defined benefit pension plan for United Mine Workers of America (1974 Pension Plan), (ii) we guaranteed performance by Murray Energy under various West Virginia and Pennsylvania operational surety bonds and workers compensation obligations, under various equipment leases and to reclaim an impoundment site, and (iii) we leased or subleased various mining equipment to Murray Energy and we guaranteed performance by Murray Energy of certain coal supply agreements that Murray Energy acquired in the transaction. Our maximum estimated exposure under our Murray Energy guarantees as of December 31, 2014 was approximately $261 million. The leases and subleases we entered into with Murray Energy relate to approximately $201 million of equipment. Murray Energy also acquired retiree medical liabilities under the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefits Act of 1992, for which Murray Energy is primarily liable, but CONSOL Energy remains secondarily liable. On November 12, 2013 in connection with the transaction, Moody\u2019s assigned Murray Energy a family credit rating of B3 (speculative and subject to high credit risk) and its secured second lien notes due 2021 a rating of Caa1(poor standing and subject to very high credit risk). Any failure by Murray Energy to satisfy these assumed liabilities or perform under these agreements could result in substantial claims against us by third parties and materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, we will regularly evaluate the likelihood of default by Murray Energy under the guarantees we have provided. The results of the evaluation may materially impact our results of operations. If Murray Energy defaults under the obligations we guarantee our cash flows may also be materially impacted.\nTerrorist attacks or a cyber incident could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.\nWe have become increasingly dependent upon digital technologies, including information systems, infrastructure and cloud applications and services, to operate our businesses, to process and record financial and operating data, communicate with our employees and business partners, analyze seismic and drilling information, estimate quantities of oil and gas reserves and coal reserves, as well as other activities related to our businesses. Strategic targets, such as energy-related assets, may be at greater risk of future terrorist or cyber attacks than other targets in the United States. Deliberate attacks on, or security breaches in our systems or infrastructure, or the systems or infrastructure of third parties, or the cloud could lead to corruption or loss of our proprietary data and potentially sensitive data, delays in production or delivery, difficulty in completing and settling transactions, challenges in maintaining our books and records, environmental damage, communication interruptions, other operational disruptions and third party liability. Our insurance may not protect us against such occurrences. Consequently, it is possible that any of these occurrences, or a combination of them, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, as cyber incidents continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents.\nA substantial majority of sales of thermal coal and high volatile metallurgical coal are from three mines at one location in Pennsylvania while a substantial majority of our low volatile metallurgical coal is from one mine located in Virginia, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in a single geographic area.\nThe substantial majority of our sales of thermal coal and high volatile metallurgical coal, as well as our thermal coal reserves, are from our Bailey, Enlow Fork and Harvey underground mining complexes located in Greene County, Pennsylvania. In addition, we also rely upon one coal processing plant and rail load facility, located in Enon, Pennsylvania for shipping coal from all of these mines. Any disruption in the functioning of this coal processing plant and rail load facility such as the\nstructural failure at the above ground conveyor system which occurred in 2012 or in transportation in this area could significantly reduce our sales of thermal and high volatile metallurgical coal and adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition.\nSimilarly, the substantial majority of our low volatile metallurgical coal sales, as well as our low volatile metallurgical coal reserves, are from our Buchanan mine located in Mavisdale, Virginia. Any disruption in the functioning of this mine (such as the 2007 mine incident which idled the Buchanan mine for approximately nine months) or transportation in this area could significantly reduce our sales of low volatile metallurgical coal and adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition.\nOur inability to complete the proposed initial public offerings of our thermal coal and metallurgical coal businesses on the terms currently contemplated, or at all, may result in a reduction in our 2015 capital budget.\nWe are pursuing an initial public offering of limited partnership interests in a master limited partnership entity that would indirectly own substantially all of our thermal coal assets. We are also pursuing an initial public offering for a subsidiary which would indirectly own substantially all of our low volatile metallurgical coal assets. Adverse developments in our thermal or metallurgical coal businesses may result in our failure to complete either or both of these initial public offerings or decrease the proceeds which we anticipate receiving. Adverse developments include the various matters set forth in these risk factors which could adversely impact our coal businesses. In addition, general market conditions, including the market for yield securities, may impact our ability to complete the initial public offerings on the terms currently contemplated, or at all. Our inability to complete the initial public offerings on the terms currently contemplated, or at all, may result in a reduction in our 2015 capital budget.", "PERMNO": 86799, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "CNX"}
