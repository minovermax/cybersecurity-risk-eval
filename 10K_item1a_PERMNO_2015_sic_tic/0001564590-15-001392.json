{"cik": "811240", "company": "BIOLASE, INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-06", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently consider to be immaterial may also adversely affect us. If any of the following risks come to fruition, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and future growth prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected. In these circumstances, the market price of our stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nWe are vulnerable to continued global economic uncertainty and volatility in financial markets.\nOur business is highly sensitive to changes in general economic conditions as a seller of capital equipment to end users in dental professional practices. Financial markets inside the United States and internationally have experienced extreme disruption in recent times, including, among other things, extreme volatility in security prices, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, and declining valuations of investments. These disruptions are likely to have an ongoing adverse effect on the world economy. A continuing economic downturn and financial market disruptions may:\n\u00b7\nreduce demand for our products and services, increase order cancellations and result in longer sales cycles and slower adoption of new technologies;\n\u00b7\nincrease the difficulty of collecting accounts receivable and the risk of excess and obsolete inventories;\n\u00b7\nincrease price competition in our served markets; and\n\u00b7\nresult in supply interruptions, which could disrupt our ability to produce our products.\nWe have experienced net losses for each of the past three years and we may experience additional losses and have difficulty achieving profitability in the future.\nWe had an accumulated deficit of approximately $142.7 million at December 31, 2014. We recorded net losses of approximately $18.9 million, $11.5 million, and $3.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. In order to achieve profitability, we must control our costs and increase net revenue through new sales. Failure to increase our net revenue and decrease our costs could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future, and if we are unable to secure adequate funds on terms acceptable to us, we may be unable to execute our business plan.\nTo remain competitive, we must continue to make significant investments in the development of our products, the expansion of our sales and marketing activities, and the expansion of our operating and management infrastructure as we increase sales domestically and internationally. If cash generated from our operations is insufficient to fund such growth, we may be required to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities in the public or private markets, or through a collaborative arrangement or sale of assets. Additional financing opportunities may not be available to us, or if available, may not be on favorable terms. The availability of financing opportunities will depend, in part, on market conditions, and the outlook for our business. Any future issuance of equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities could result in substantial dilution to our stockholders, and the securities issued in such a financing may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock. In addition, if we raise additional funds through debt financing, we may be subject to debt covenants that could place limitations on our operations. We may not be able to raise additional capital on reasonable terms, or at all, or we may use capital more rapidly than anticipated. If we cannot raise the required capital when needed, we may not be able to satisfy the demands of existing and prospective customers, we may lose revenue and market share and we may have to curtail our capital expenditures. The following factors, among others, could affect our ability to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all:\n\u00b7\nour results of operations;\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic conditions and conditions in the dental or medical device industries;\n\u00b7\nthe perception of our business in the capital markets;\n\u00b7\nour ratio of debt to equity;\n\u00b7\nour financial condition;\n\u00b7\nour business prospects; and\n\u00b7\ninterest rates.\nIf we are unable to obtain sufficient capital in the future, we may have to curtail our capital expenditures. Any curtailment of our capital expenditures could result in a reduction in net revenue, reduced quality of our products, increased manufacturing costs for our products, harm to our reputation, reduced manufacturing efficiencies or other harm to our business.\nOur success depends, in part, on our relationships with, and the efforts of, third-party distributors.\nWe rely on exclusive and non-exclusive third-party distributors for a portion of our sales in North America and a majority of our sales in countries outside of the U.S. and Canada. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, revenue from distributors accounted for approximately 30%, 30%, and 23% of our total net revenue, respectively. Our distributors have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources they apply to the sale of our products, and we face significant challenges and risks in expanding, training, and managing our third-party distributors, particularly given that their geographically dispersed operations. Our distributors may not commit the necessary resources to market and sell our products to the level of our expectations, and, regardless of the resources they commit, they may not be successful. From time to time, we may face competition or pricing pressure from one or more of our non-exclusive distributors in certain geographic areas where those distributors are selling inventory to the same customer base as us. Additionally, most of our distributor agreements can be terminated with limited notice, and we may not be able to replace any terminating distributor in a timely manner or on terms agreeable to us, if at all. If we are not able to maintain our distribution network, if our distribution network is not successful in marketing and selling our products, or if we experience a significant reduction in, cancellation, or change in the size and timing of orders from our distributors, our revenues could decline significantly.\nDentists and patients have been hesitant in adopting laser technologies and our inability to overcome this hesitation could limit the market acceptance of our products and our market share.\nOur dental laser systems represent relatively new technologies in the dental market. Only a small percentage of dentists use lasers to perform dental procedures. Our future success will depend on our ability to increase demand for our products by demonstrating to a broad spectrum of dentists and patients the potential performance advantages of our laser systems over traditional methods of treatment and over competitive laser systems. Historically, we have experienced long sales cycles because dentists have been, and may continue to be, slow to adopt new technologies on a widespread basis. As a result, we generally are required to invest a significant amount of time and resources to educate dentists about the benefits of our products in comparison to competing products and technologies before completing a sale, if any.\nFactors that may inhibit adoption of laser technologies by dentists include cost and concerns about the safety, efficacy and reliability of lasers. In order to invest in a WaterLase system, a dentist generally needs to invest time to understand the technology, consider how patients may respond to the new technology, assess the financial impact the investment may have on the dentist\u2019s practice and become comfortable performing procedures with our products. Absent an immediate competitive motivation, a dentist may not feel compelled to invest the time required to learn about the potential benefits of using a laser system. Dentists may not accept or adopt our products until they see additional clinical evidence supporting the safety and efficiency of our products or recommendations supporting our laser systems by influential dental practitioners. In addition, economic pressure, caused, for example, by an economic slowdown, changes in health care reimbursement or by competitive factors in a specific market, may make dentists reluctant to purchase substantial capital equipment or invest in new technologies. Patient acceptance will depend on the recommendations of dentists and specialists, as well as other factors, including the relative effectiveness, safety, reliability and comfort of our systems as compared to other instruments and methods for performing dental procedures.\nAny failure in our efforts to train dental practitioners could result in the misuse of our products and reduce the market acceptance of our products.\nThere is a learning process involved for dental practitioners to become proficient users of our laser systems. It is critical to the success of our sales efforts to adequately train a sufficient number of dental practitioners. Following completion of training, we rely on the trained dental practitioners to advocate the benefits of our products in the broader marketplace. Convincing dental practitioners to dedicate the time and energy necessary for adequate training is challenging, and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in these efforts. If dental practitioners are not properly trained, they may misuse or ineffectively use our products, or may be less likely to appreciate our laser systems. This may also result in unsatisfactory patient outcomes, patient injury, negative publicity, or lawsuits against us, any of which could negatively affect our reputation and sales of our laser systems.\nIf future data proves to be inconsistent with our clinical results or if competitors\u2019 products present more favorable results our revenues may decline.\nIf new studies or comparative studies generate results that are not as favorable as our clinical results, our revenues may decline. Additionally, if future studies indicate that our competitors\u2019 products are more effective or safer than ours, our revenues may decline. Furthermore, dental practitioners may choose not to purchase our laser systems until they receive additional published long-term clinical evidence and recommendations from prominent dental practitioners that indicate our laser systems are effective for dental applications.\nWe face competition from other companies, many of which have substantially greater resources than we do. If we do not successfully develop and commercialize enhanced or new products that remain competitive with products or alternative technologies developed by others, we could lose revenue opportunities and customers and our ability to grow our business would be impaired.\nA number of competitors have substantially greater capital resources, larger customer bases, larger technical, sales and marketing forces and stronger reputations with target customers than ours. We compete with a number of domestic and foreign companies that market traditional dental products, such as dental drills, as well as companies that market laser technologies in the dental and medical markets. The marketplace is highly fragmented and very competitive. We expect that the rapid technological changes occurring in the health care industry may lead to the entry of new competitors, particularly if dental and medical lasers gain increasing market acceptance. If we do not compete successfully, our revenue and market share may decline.\nOur long-term success depends upon our ability to (i) distinguish our products through improving our product performance and pricing, protecting our intellectual property, improving our customer support, accurately timing the introduction of new products, and developing sustainable distribution channels worldwide; and (ii) develop and successfully commercialize new products, new or improved technologies, and additional applications for our laser systems.\nIf our customers cannot obtain third-party reimbursement for their use of our products, they may be less inclined to purchase our products.\nOur products are generally purchased by dental or medical professionals who have various billing practices and patient mixes. Such practices range from primarily private pay to those who rely heavily on third-party payers, such as private insurance or government programs. In the United States, third-party payers review and frequently challenge the prices charged for medical products and/or services. In many foreign countries, the prices for dental services are predetermined through government regulation. Payers may deny coverage and reimbursement on various grounds, including if they determine that the procedure was not medically necessary or that the device used in the procedure was investigational. Accordingly, both coverage and reimbursement can vary significantly from payer to payer. For the portion of dentists who rely heavily on third-party reimbursement, the inability to obtain reimbursement for services using our products could deter them from purchasing or using our products. We cannot predict the effect that future health care reforms or changes in financing for health and dental plans may have on our business. Any such changes could have an adverse effect on the ability of a dental or medical professional to generate a profit using our current or future products. In addition, such changes could act as disincentives for capital investments by dental and medical professionals.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryforwards may be limited.\nSection 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cIRC\u201d) of 1986 generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that may be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone significant changes in its stock ownership. In 2006, we completed an analysis to determine the applicability of the annual limitations imposed by IRC Section 382 caused by previous changes in our stock ownership and determined that such limitations should not be significant. Based on our analysis, we believe that, as of December 31, 2014, approximately $93.2 million of net operating loss carryforwards were available to us for federal income tax purposes. A detailed analysis will be required at the time we begin utilization of any net operating losses to determine if there is an IRC Section 382 limitation. In addition, any ownership changes qualifying under IRC Section 382, including changes resulting from or affected by public offerings or stock repurchase plans, may adversely affect our ability to use our remaining net operating loss carryforwards. If we lose our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards, any income we generate will be subject to tax earlier than it would be if we were able to use net operating loss carryforwards, resulting in lower profits.\nWe may incur problems in manufacturing our products.\nIn order to grow our business, we must expand our manufacturing capabilities to produce the systems and accessories necessary to meet any demand we may experience. We may encounter difficulties in increasing the production of our products, including problems involving production capacity and yields, quality control and assurance, component supply, and shortages of qualified personnel. In addition, before we can begin commercial manufacture of our products, we must ensure our manufacturing facilities, processes, and quality systems, and the manufacture of our laser systems, comply with FDA regulations governing facility compliance, quality control, and documentation policies and procedures. In addition, our manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA, as well as various state agencies and foreign regulatory agencies. From time to time, we may expend significant resources in obtaining, maintaining, and addressing our compliance with these requirements. Our success will depend in part upon our ability to manufacture our products in compliance with the FDA\u2019s QSR and other regulatory requirements. We have experienced quality issues with components of our products supplied by third parties. Our future success depends on our ability to manufacture our products on a timely basis with acceptable manufacturing costs, while at the same time maintaining good quality control and complying with applicable regulatory requirements.\nWe may be subject to significant warranty obligations if our products are defective.\nIn manufacturing our products, we depend upon third parties for the supply of various components. Many of these components require a significant degree of technical expertise to design and produce. If we fail to adequately design, or if our suppliers fail to produce components to specification, or if the suppliers, or we, use defective materials or workmanship in the manufacturing process, the reliability and performance of our products will be compromised. We have experienced such non-compliance with manufacturing specifications in the past and may continue to experience such non-compliance in the future, which could lead to higher costs and reduced gross margins.\nOur products may contain defects that cannot be repaired easily and inexpensively, and we have experienced in the past and may experience in the future some or all of the following:\n\u00b7\nloss of customer orders and delay in order fulfillment;\n\u00b7\ndamage to our brand reputation;\n\u00b7\nincreased cost of our warranty program due to product repair or replacement;\n\u00b7\ninability to attract new customers;\n\u00b7\ndiversion of resources from our manufacturing and engineering and development departments into our service department; and\n\u00b7\nlegal action.\nAdverse publicity regarding our technology or products could negatively impact us.\nAdverse publicity regarding any of our products or similar products marketed or sold by others could negatively affect us. If any studies raise or substantiate concerns regarding the efficacy or safety of our products or other concerns, our reputation could be harmed and demand for our products could diminish.\nProduct liability claims against us could be costly and could harm our reputation.\nThe sale of dental and medical devices involves the risk of product liability claims against us. Claims could exceed our product liability insurance coverage limits. Our insurance policies are subject to various standard coverage exclusions, including damage to the product itself, losses from recall of our product, and losses covered by other forms of insurance such as workers compensation. We cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully defend any claims against us, nor can we be certain that our insurance will cover all liabilities resulting from such claims. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such insurance in the future on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, any product liability claim brought against us could result in harm to our reputation, decreased demand for our products, costs related to litigation, product recalls, loss of revenue, an increase in our product liability insurance rates, or the inability to secure coverage in the future, and may cause our business to suffer.\nOur suppliers may not supply us with a sufficient amount or adequate quality of materials.\nOur business depends on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of materials, components, and subassemblies of acceptable quality and in acceptable quantities from third-party suppliers. We generally purchase components and subassemblies from a limited group of suppliers through purchase orders, rather than written supply contracts. Consequently, many of our suppliers have no obligation to continue to supply us on a long-term basis. In addition, our suppliers manufacture products for a range of customers, and fluctuations in demand for the products those suppliers manufacture for others may affect their ability to deliver components for us in a timely manner. Moreover, our suppliers may encounter financial hardships, be acquired, or experience other business events unrelated to our demand for components, which could inhibit or prevent their ability to fulfill our orders and satisfy our requirements.\nCertain components of our products, particularly specialized components used in our laser systems, are currently available only from a single source or limited sources. For example, the crystal, fiber, and hand pieces used in our WaterLase systems are each supplied by a separate single supplier. Our dependence on single-source suppliers involves several risks, including limited control over pricing, availability, quality, and delivery schedules.\nIf any of our suppliers ceases to provide us with sufficient quantities of our components in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us, or ceases to manufacture components of acceptable quality, we could incur manufacturing delays and sales disruptions while we locate and engage alternative qualified suppliers, and we might be unable to engage acceptable alternative suppliers on favorable terms. In addition, we may need to reengineer our components, which may require product redesign and submission to the FDA of a 510(k) application, which could significantly delay production. Any interruption or delay in the supply of components or materials, or our inability to obtain components or materials from alternate sources at acceptable prices in a timely manner, could impair our ability to meet the demand of our customers and cause them to cancel orders or switch to competitive procedures. As of the date on which this Form 10-K was filed with the SEC, we were in the process of identifying and qualifying alternate source suppliers for our key components. There can be no assurance, however, that we will successfully identify and qualify an alternate source supplier for any of our key components or that we could enter into an agreement with any such alternate source supplier on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nRapidly changing standards and competing technologies could harm demand for our products or result in significant additional costs.\nThe markets in which our products compete are subject to rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, changes in the regulatory environment, and frequent introductions of new devices and evolving dental and surgical techniques. Competing products may emerge that could render our products uncompetitive or obsolete. The process of developing new medical devices is inherently complex and requires regulatory approvals or clearances that can be expensive, time-consuming, and uncertain. We cannot guarantee that we will successfully identify new product opportunities, identify new and innovative applications of our technology, or be financially or otherwise capable of completing the research and development required to bring new products to market in a timely manner. An inability to expand our product offerings or the application of our technology could limit our growth. In addition, we may incur higher manufacturing costs if manufacturing processes or standards change, and we may need to replace, modify, design, or build and install equipment, all of which would require additional capital expenditures.\nWe may be unable to effectively manage and implement our growth strategies.\nOur growth strategy includes expanding our product line and clinical applications by developing enhancements and transformational innovations, including new clinical solutions for dental applications and for other adjacent medical applications. Expansion of our existing product line and entry into new medical applications divert the use of our resources and systems, require additional resources that might not be available (or available on acceptable terms), require additional country-specific regulatory approvals, result in new or increasing competition, may require longer implementation times or greater start-up expenditures than anticipated, and may otherwise fail to achieve the desired results in a timely fashion, if at all. These efforts may also require that we successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner, price them competitively and cost-effectively, and manufacture and deliver sufficient volumes of new products of appropriate quality on time. We may be unable to increase our sales and earnings by expanding our product offerings in a cost-effective manner, and we may fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or to produce viable technologies. In addition, we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue. Even if we successfully innovate and develop new products and product enhancements, we may incur substantial costs in doing so. In addition, promising new products may fail to reach the market or realize only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes, or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement.\nWe have significant international sales and are subject to risks associated with operating in international markets.\nInternational sales comprise a significant portion of our net revenue and we intend to continue to pursue and expand our international business activities. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, international sales accounted for approximately 37%, 37%, and 29% of our net revenue, respectively. Political and economic conditions outside the United States could make it difficult for us to increase our international revenue or to operate abroad. International operations are subject to many inherent risks, including among others:\n\u00b7\nadverse changes in tariffs and trade restrictions;\n\u00b7\npolitical, social, and economic instability and increased security concerns;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u00b7\nlonger collection periods and difficulties in collecting receivables from foreign entities;\n\u00b7\nexposure to different legal standards;\n\u00b7\ntransportation delays and difficulties of managing international distribution channels;\n\u00b7\nreduced protection for our intellectual property in some countries;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in obtaining domestic and foreign export, import, and other governmental approvals, permits, and licenses, and compliance with foreign laws;\n\u00b7\nthe imposition of governmental controls;\n\u00b7\nunexpected changes in regulatory or certification requirements;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations; and\n\u00b7\npotentially adverse tax consequences and the complexities of foreign value-added tax systems.\nWe believe that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our net revenue, and we intend to expand our international operations further. In international markets where our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, an increase in the relative value of the dollar against the currency in such markets could indirectly increase the price of our products in those markets and result in a decrease in sales. We do not currently engage in any transactions as a hedge against risks of loss due to foreign currency fluctuations. However, we may do so in the future.\nWe may be subject to breaches of our information technology systems, which could damage our reputation and customer relationships. Such breaches could subject us to significant reputational, financial, legal, and operational consequences.\nWe rely on information systems (\u201cIS\u201d) in our business to obtain, rapidly process, analyze and manage data to, among other things:\n\u00b7\nfacilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items through numerous distributors;\n\u00b7\nreceive, process and ship orders on a timely basis;\n\u00b7\naccurately bill and collect from thousands of customers;\n\u00b7\nprocess payments to suppliers; and\n\u00b7\nprovide technical support to our customers.\nA cyber-attack that bypasses our IS security causing an IS security breach may lead to a material disruption of our IS and/or the loss of business information.\n\u00b7\nSuch an attack may result in the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation or release of confidential data and intellectual property;\n\u00b7\noperational or business delays; and\n\u00b7\nliability for a breach of personal financial and health information belonging to our customers and their patients. In the event of an attack, we would be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability.\nOur revenue and operating results fluctuate due to seasonality and other factors, so you should not rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results as an indication of our future performance.\nOur revenue typically fluctuates from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Revenue in the first quarter typically is lower than average, and revenue in the fourth quarter typically is stronger than average due to the buying patterns of dental practitioners. We believe that this trend exists because a significant number of dentists purchase their capital equipment towards the end of the calendar year in order to maximize their practice earnings while seeking to minimize their taxes. They often use certain tax incentives, such as accelerated depreciation methods for purchasing capital equipment, as part of their year-end tax planning. In addition, revenue in the third quarter may be affected by vacation patterns, which can cause revenue to be flat or lower than in the second quarter of the year. Our historical seasonal fluctuations may also be impacted by sales promotions used by large dental distributors that encourage end-of-quarter and end-of-year buying in our industry. Other factors that might cause quarterly fluctuations in our revenue and operating results include the following:\n\u00b7\nvariation in demand for our products;\n\u00b7\nour ability to research, develop, market, and sell new products and product enhancements in a timely manner;\n\u00b7\nour ability to control costs;\n\u00b7\nour ability to control quality issues with our products;\n\u00b7\nregulatory actions that impact our manufacturing processes;\n\u00b7\nthe size, timing, rescheduling, or cancellation of orders from distributors;\n\u00b7\nthe introduction of new products by competitors;\n\u00b7\nthe length of and fluctuations in sales cycles;\n\u00b7\nthe availability and reliability of components used to manufacture our products;\n\u00b7\nchanges in our pricing policies or those of our suppliers and competitors, as well as increased price competition in general;\n\u00b7\nlegal expenses, particularly related to litigation matters;\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic conditions including the availability of credit for our existing and potential customer base to finance purchases;\n\u00b7\nthe mix of our domestic and international sales and the risks and uncertainties associated with international business;\n\u00b7\ncosts associated with any future acquisitions of technologies and businesses;\n\u00b7\nlimitations on our ability to use net operating loss carry-forwards under the provisions of IRC Section 382 and similar state laws;\n\u00b7\ndevelopments concerning the protection of our intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7\ncatastrophic events such as hurricanes, floods, and earthquakes, which can affect our ability to advertise, sell, and distribute our products, including through national conferences held in regions in which these disasters strike; and\n\u00b7\nglobal economic, political, and social events, including international conflicts and acts of terrorism.\nThe expenses we incur are based, in large part, on our expectations regarding future net revenue. Since many of our costs are fixed in the short term, we may be unable to reduce expenses quickly enough to avoid losses if we experience a decrease in expected net revenue. Accordingly, you should not rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results as an indication of our future performance.\nLitigation against us could be costly and time-consuming to defend\nWe are from time to time involved in various claims, litigation matters and regulatory proceedings incidental to our business, including claims for damages arising out of the use of our products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters, employment matters, commercial disputes, competition, sales and trading practices, environmental matters, personal injury, and insurance coverage. Some of these lawsuits include claims for punitive as well as compensatory damages. The defense of these lawsuits may divert our management\u2019s attention, and we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits. In addition, we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to unfavorable equitable remedies. Moreover, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures.\nOur operations are consolidated primarily in one facility. A disruption at this facility could result in a prolonged interruption of our business.\nSubstantially all of our administrative operations and our manufacturing operations are located at our facility in Irvine, California, which is near known earthquake fault zones. We have taken precautions to safeguard our facilities including disaster recovery planning and off-site backup of computer data. However, a natural disaster such as an earthquake, fire, or flood, could seriously harm our facility and significantly disrupt our operations. Additionally, labor disputes, maintenance requirements, power outages, equipment failures, civil unrest, or terrorist attacks affecting our Irvine, California facility may significantly disrupt our operations. Our business interruption insurance coverage may not cover all or any of our losses from natural disasters or other disruptions.\nIf we lose our key management personnel, or are unable to attract or retain qualified personnel, it could adversely affect our ability to execute our growth strategy.\nOur success is dependent, in part, upon our ability to hire and retain management, engineers, marketing and sales personnel, technical, research and other personnel who are in high demand and are often subject to competing employment opportunities. Our success will depend on our ability to retain our current management, engineers, marketing and sales, technical, research and other personnel and to attract and retain qualified like personnel in the future. Competition for senior management, engineers, marketing and sales personnel, and other specialized technicians is intense and we may not be able to retain our personnel. If we lose the services of any executive officers or key employees, our ability to achieve our business objectives could be harmed. In general, our officers may terminate their employment at any time without notice for any reason.\nAcquisitions involve risks and uncertainties, including difficulties integrating acquired businesses successfully into our existing operations and risks of discovering previously undisclosed liabilities.\nSuccessful acquisitions depend upon our ability to identify, negotiate, complete, and integrate suitable acquisitions and to obtain any necessary financing. We expect to continue to consider opportunities to acquire or make investments in other technologies, products and businesses that could enhance our capabilities, complement our current products, or expand the breadth of our markets or customer base. We have limited experience in acquiring other businesses and technologies. Even if we complete acquisitions, we may experience:\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in integrating any acquired companies, personnel, products, and other assets into our existing business;\n\u00b7\ndelays in realizing the benefits of the acquired company, product, or other assets;\n\u00b7\ndiversion of our management\u2019s time and attention from other business concerns;\n\u00b7\nlimited or no direct prior experience in new markets or countries we may enter;\n\u00b7\nhigher costs of integration than we anticipated; and\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in retaining key employees of the acquired business.\nIn addition, an acquisition could cause us to incur debt or issue shares, resulting in dilution to existing shareholders. We may also discover deficiencies in internal controls, data adequacy and integrity, product quality, regulatory compliance, and product liabilities that we did not uncover prior to our acquisition of such businesses, which could result in us becoming subject to penalties or other liabilities. Any difficulties in the integration of acquired businesses or unexpected penalties or liabilities in connection with such businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and result of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with the reporting obligations of the Exchange Act and Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, or if we fail to maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting, our business, results of operations and financial condition and investors\u2019 confidence in us could be materially and adversely affected.\nAs a public company, we are required to comply with the periodic reporting obligations of the Exchange Act, including preparing annual reports, quarterly reports, and current reports. Our failure to prepare and disclose this information in a timely manner and meet our reporting obligations in their entirety could subject us to penalties under federal securities laws and regulations of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, expose us to lawsuits, and restrict our ability to access financing on favorable terms, or at all.\nSection 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act added Section 13(p) to the Exchange Act which requires us to disclose annually whether any conflict minerals, including tantalum, tin, gold, and tungsten, that are necessary to the functionality or production of a product manufactured by us originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or an adjoining country. Components of our products containing these minerals are sourced through various vendors who may have complex supply chains that may change from time to time due to the influence of availability, pricing, or other factors in their purchasing decisions. On an annual basis, we are required to conduct a good faith and reasonable effort to determine the source of these materials. However, there can be no assurance that members of our supply chain will be willing or able to provide this information or further identify their sources of supply or notify us timely of changes by May 31 subsequent to year-end.\nIn addition, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the \u201cSarbanes Oxley Act\u201d), we are required to evaluate and provide a management report of our systems of internal control over financial reporting. During the course of the evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting, we may identify areas requiring improvement and may be required to design enhanced processes and controls to address issues identified through this review. This could result in significant delays and costs to us and require us to divert substantial resources, including management time, from other activities. In addition, if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the Sarbanes Oxley Act. Moreover, effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent fraud. Any failure to maintain compliance with the requirements of Section 404 on a timely basis could result in the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which in turn could, negatively impact the trading price of our stock, and adversely affect investors\u2019 confidence in our company and our ability to access capital markets for financing.\nClimate change initiatives may materially and adversely affect our business.\nOur manufacturing processes require that we purchase significant quantities of energy from third parties, which results in the generation of greenhouse gases, either directly on-site or indirectly at electric utilities. Both domestic and international legislation to address climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and establishing a price on carbon could create increases in energy costs and price volatility. Considerable international attention is now focused on development of an international policy framework to address climate change. Proposed and existing legislative efforts to control or limit greenhouse gas emissions could affect our energy source and supply choices as well as increase the cost of energy and raw materials derived from sources that generate greenhouse gas emissions. If our suppliers are unable to obtain energy at a reasonable cost in the future, the cost of our raw materials may be negatively impacted which could result in increased manufacturing costs.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf the patents that we own or license, or our other intellectual property rights, do not adequately protect our technologies, we may lose market share to our competitors and be unable to operate our business profitably.\nOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products and technology, to preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing the intellectual property of others. We rely on patents to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products. We currently possess a number of issued patents and patent applications with respect to our products and technology. However, we cannot assure that any additional patents will be issued, that the scope of any patent protection will be effective in helping us address our competition, or that any of our patents will be held valid if subsequently challenged. It is also possible that our competitors may independently develop similar or more desirable products, duplicate our products, or design products that circumvent our patents. The laws of foreign countries may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. In addition, there have been recent changes in the patent laws and rules of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and there may be future proposed changes that, if enacted, may have a significant impact on our ability to protect our technology and enforce our intellectual property rights. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitive position may be adversely affected.\nIf third parties claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights, we may incur liabilities and costs and may have to redesign or discontinue selling certain products.\nWe face substantial uncertainty regarding the impact that other parties\u2019 intellectual property positions will have on dental and other medical laser applications. The medical technology industry has in the past been characterized by a substantial amount of litigation and related administrative proceedings regarding patents and intellectual property rights. From time to time, we have received, and we expect to continue to receive, notices of claims of infringement, misappropriation, or misuse of other parties\u2019 proprietary rights. Some of these claims may lead to litigation. We may not prevail in any future intellectual property infringement litigation given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in litigation. Any claims, with or without merit, may be time-consuming and distracting to management, result in costly litigation, or cause product shipment delays. Adverse determinations in litigation could subject us to significant liability and could result in the loss of proprietary rights. A successful lawsuit against us could also force us to cease selling or redesign products that incorporate the infringed intellectual property. Additionally, we could be required to seek a license from the holder of the intellectual property to use the infringed technology, and it is possible that we may not be able to obtain a license on acceptable terms, or at all.\nRisks Related to Our Regulatory Environment\nChanges in government regulation or the inability to obtain or maintain necessary government approvals could harm our business.\nOur products are subject to extensive government regulation, both in the United States and in other countries. To clinically test, manufacture and market products for human use, we must comply with regulations and safety standards set by the FDA and comparable state and foreign agencies. Regulations adopted by the FDA are wide-ranging and govern, among other things, product design, development, manufacture and control testing, labeling control, storage, advertising, and sales. Generally, products must meet regulatory standards as safe and effective for their intended use before being marketed for human applications. The clearance process is expensive, time-consuming, and uncertain. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements of the FDA can result in an enforcement action which may include a variety of sanctions, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of our products, operating restrictions, partial suspension, or total shutdown of production and criminal prosecution. The failure to receive or maintain requisite approvals for the use of our products or processes, or significant delays in obtaining such approvals, could prevent us from developing, manufacturing, and marketing products and services necessary for us to remain competitive.\nIf we develop new products and applications or make any significant modifications to our existing products or labeling, we will need to obtain additional regulatory clearances or approvals. Any modification that could significantly affect a product\u2019s safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a change in its intended use, will require a new FDA 510(k) clearance, or could require a PMA application. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer\u2019s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer\u2019s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA is obtained. If 510(k) clearance is denied and a PMA application is required, we could be required to submit substantially more data, may be required to conduct human clinical testing and would very likely be subject to a significantly longer review period.\nProducts sold in international markets are also subject to the regulatory requirements of each respective country or region. The regulations of the European Union require that a device have a CE Mark, indicating conformance with European Union laws and regulations before it can be sold in the European Union. The regulatory international review process varies from country to country. We rely on our distributors and sales representatives in the foreign countries in which we market our products to comply with the regulatory laws of such countries. Failure to comply with the laws of such countries could prevent us from continuing to sell products in such countries. In addition, unanticipated changes in existing regulatory requirements or the adoption of new requirements could impose significant costs and burdens on us, which could increase our operating expenses.\nChanges in health care regulations in the U.S. and elsewhere could adversely affect the demand for our products as well as the way in which we conduct our business. Significantly, President Obama signed health care reform legislation into law that will require most individuals to have health insurance, establish new regulations for health plans, and create insurance pooling mechanisms and other expanded public health care measures. In general, an expansion of government\u2019s role in the U.S. health care industry may lower reimbursements for our products or the procedures, for which our products are used, reduce demand for innovative products, and reduce volumes for dental and medical procedures. In addition, as a result of the focus on health care reform, there is risk that Congress may implement changes in laws and regulations governing health care service providers, including measures to control costs, and reductions in reimbursement levels.\nWe may be subject to or otherwise affected by federal and state health care laws, including fraud and abuse and health information privacy and security laws, and we could face substantial penalties if we are unable to fully comply with such regulations.\nWe are directly or indirectly, through our customers, subject to extensive regulation by both the federal government and the states and foreign countries in which we conduct our business. The laws that directly or indirectly affect our ability to operate our business include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7\nthe Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which regulates the design, testing, manufacture, labeling, marketing, distribution, and sale of prescription drugs and medical devices;\n\u00b7\nstate food and drug laws;\n\u00b7\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Law, which prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce the referral for the furnishing of, or the purchase, order, or recommendation of, a good or service, for which payment may be made under FHCPs such as Medicare, Medicaid, and TRICARE;\n\u00b7\nstate law equivalents to the Anti-Kickback Law, which may not be limited to government reimbursed items;\n\u00b7\nstate laws that prohibit fee-splitting arrangements;\n\u00b7\nthe federal Civil False Claims Act, which imposes liability on any person or entity that knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the government, including FHCPs;\n\u00b7\nstate false claims laws that prohibit anyone from presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to third-party payers that are false or fraudulent;\n\u00b7\nfederal crimes for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program or making false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for items or services under a health care benefit program;\n\u00b7\nfederal law prohibiting offering remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary to influence the beneficiary\u2019s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier;\n\u00b7\nthe federal Stark Law, which, in the absence of a statutory or regulatory exception, prohibits: (i) the referral of Medicare or Medicaid patients by a physician to an entity for the provision of designated health care services, if the physician or a member of the physician\u2019s immediate family has a direct or indirect financial relationship, including an ownership interest in, or a compensation arrangement with, the entity and (ii) submitting a bill to Medicare or Medicaid for services rendered pursuant to a prohibited referral;\n\u00b7\nstate law equivalents to the Stark Law, which may not be limited to government reimbursed items\n\u00b7\nthe Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires us to report annually to CMS certain payments and other transfers of value we make to U.S.-licensed physicians, dentists, and teaching hospitals;\n\u00b7\nthe FCPA, which generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from paying anything of value to foreign officials to influence any decision of the foreign official in his/her official capacity or to secure any other improper advantage to obtain or retain business;\n\u00b7\nHIPAA and HITECH and their implementing regulations, which govern the use, disclosure, and safeguarding of PHI;\n\u00b7\nstate privacy laws that protect the confidentiality of patient information;\n\u00b7\nMedicare and Medicaid laws and regulations that prescribe the requirements for coverage and payment, including the amount of such payment; state laws that prohibit the practice of medicine by non-physicians; and\n\u00b7\nthe Federal Trade Commission Act and similar laws regulating advertising and consumer protection.\nIf our past or present operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or the other governmental laws or regulations to which we or our customers are subject, we may be subject to the applicable penalty associated with the violation, which may include civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from FHCPs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If we are required to obtain permits or licensure under these laws that we do not already possess, we may become subject to substantial additional regulation or incur significant expense. Any penalties, damages, fines, or curtailment or restructuring of our operations could be significant. The risk of potential non-compliance is increased by the fact that many of these laws have not been fully interpreted by applicable regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations and additional legal or regulatory change. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business, and damage our reputation.\nWe may be exposed to liabilities under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and any determination that we violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and result of operations.\nIn light of our operations outside the United States, we are subject to the FCPA, which generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from offering to pay, promising to pay, or authorizing the payment of money or anything of value to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign official in his/her capacity or to secure any other improper advantage to obtain or retain business. Violation of the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA can result in criminal fines of up to $2 million and civil penalties of up to $16,000 for each violation. Individuals, including officers, directors, stockholders, and agents of companies, can be subject to a criminal fine of up to $250,000 and imprisonment, in addition to civil penalties of up to $16,000, per violation. We may be held liable for actions taken by our distributors in violation of the FCPA, even though such partners are foreign companies that may not be subject to the FCPA. Any determination that we violated the FCPA could result in sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and result of operations.\nProduct sales or introductions may be delayed or canceled as a result of the FDA regulatory process which could cause our sales or profitability to decline.\nThe process of obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals and clearances to market a medical device from the FDA and similar regulatory authorities abroad can be costly and time-consuming, and we cannot assure you that such approvals and clearances will be granted. Pursuant to FDA regulations, unless exempt, the FDA permits commercial distribution of a new medical device only after the device has received 510(k) clearance or is the subject of an approved pre-market approval application. The FDA will clear marketing of a medical device through the 510(k) process if it is demonstrated that the new product is substantially equivalent to other 510(k)-cleared products. The pre-market approval application process is more costly, lengthy and uncertain than the 510(k) process, and must be supported by extensive data, including data from preclinical studies, and human clinical trials. Because we cannot assure you that any new products, or any product enhancements, that we develop will be subject to the shorter 510(k) clearance process, significant delays in the introduction of any new products or product enhancement may occur. We cannot assure you that the FDA will not require a new product or product enhancement to go through the lengthy and expensive pre-market approval application process. Delays in obtaining regulatory clearances and approvals may:\n\u00b7\ndelay or eliminate commercialization of products we develop;\n\u00b7\nrequire us to perform costly procedures;\n\u00b7\ndiminish any competitive advantages that we may attain; and\n\u00b7\nreduce our ability to collect revenues or royalties.\nAlthough we have obtained 510(k) clearance from the FDA to market our dental laser systems, we cannot assure you that the clearance of these systems will not be withdrawn or that we will not be required to obtain new clearances or approvals for modifications or improvements to our products.\nOur products are subject to recall even after receiving FDA clearance or approval.\nThe FDA and similar governmental bodies in other countries have the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. A government mandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing errors, or design defects, including defects in labeling. Any recall would divert management\u2019s attention and financial resources and harm our reputation with customers. Any recall involving our laser systems would be particularly harmful to us, because our laser systems comprise such an important part of our portfolio of products.\nWe may be adversely affected by provisions of the Affordable Care Act.\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, we are subject to a 2.3% excise tax payable semi-monthly on U.S. revenues of certain medical devices. A significant portion of our revenue is generated from medical devices sold in the U.S. and these taxes are imposed on us whether or not we earn a profit. The Affordable Care Act also contains reporting requirements of certain payments made by us to medical and dental practitioners and teaching hospitals (the \u201cPhysician Payment Sunshine Act\u201d) which is published on a publicly available website annually. This requirement increases the administrative costs for both manufacturers and health care providers and may result in a decline in our collaborative efforts. A decline in these collaborations may adversely affect advances in our laser technology or may reduce attendance at events at which our technology is demonstrated, which could reduce demand for our products and lead to sales price pressures.\nAdditionally, the Affordable Care Act may adversely impact third-party reimbursements received by our end-user customers, which may reduce demand for our products.\nRisks Related to Our Stock\nThe liquidity and trading volume of our common stock may be low, and our ownership is concentrated.\nThe liquidity and trading volume of our common stock has at times been low in the past and may again be low in the future. If the liquidity and trading volume of our common stock is low, this could adversely impact the trading price of our shares, our ability to issue stock and our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain liquidity in their shares. The issuance of common stock by us in 2013 and 2014 involved a significant issuance of stock to a limited number of investors, significantly increasing the concentration of our share ownership in a few holders.\nOur stock price has been, and may continue to be volatile.\nThere has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of equity securities, which is often unrelated to the financial performance of the companies issuing the securities. These broad market fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our stock. The market price and volume of our common stock may fluctuate, and in the past has fluctuated, more dramatically than the stock market in general. You may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid for them due to fluctuations in the market price of our stock caused by changes in our operating performance or prospects or other factors. Some factors, in addition to the other risk factors identified above, that may have a significant effect on our stock market price include but are not limited to the following:\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results or future prospects;\n\u00b7\nour announcements or our competitors\u2019 announcements of new products;\n\u00b7\nthe public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements, and our filings with the SEC;\n\u00b7\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u00b7\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u00b7\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations, or principles;\n\u00b7\nchanges in our growth rates or our competitors\u2019 growth rates;\n\u00b7\ndevelopments regarding our patents or proprietary rights or those of our competitors;\n\u00b7\nour inability to raise additional capital as needed;\n\u00b7\nconcerns or allegations as to the safety or efficacy of our products;\n\u00b7\nchanges in financial markets or general economic conditions;\n\u00b7\nsales of stock by us or members of our management team, our Board, or certain institutional stockholders; and\n\u00b7\nchanges in stock market analyst recommendations or earnings estimates regarding our stock, other comparable companies or our industry generally.\nYou could experience substantial dilution of your investment as a result of subsequent exercises of our outstanding warrants and options, future sales of our equity, or the future grant of equity by us.\nYou could experience substantial dilution of your investment as a result of subsequent exercises of outstanding warrants and outstanding options issued as compensation for services performed by employees, directors, consultants, and others, future sales of our equity, or the grant of future equity-based awards. As of December 31, 2014, an aggregate of 9,250,000 shares of common stock were reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plan, 3,475,000 of which were subject to options outstanding as of that date at a weighted average exercise price of $3.03 per share. In addition, as of December 31, 2014, 10,094,000 shares of our common stock were subject to warrants at a weighted average exercise price of $4.18 per share. Of the 3,475,000 stock options outstanding at December 31, 2014, 2,627,000 stock options were vested and exercisable. To the extent that outstanding warrants or options are exercised, our existing stockholders may experience dilution. We rely heavily on equity awards to motivate current employees and to attract new employees. The grant of future equity awards by us to our employees and other service providers may further dilute our stockholders interests in the Company. During 2014, we sold approximately 22.4 million shares of common stock in private placements with gross proceeds totaling approximately $52.0 million. During 2013, we sold approximately 2.7 million shares of common stock in a private placement with gross proceeds totaling approximately $5.0 million, and sold 340,000 shares of common stock through an unregistered direct offering for gross proceed totaling approximately $612,000. Our Board declared a 0.5% stock dividend in the first quarter of 2014 and each of the four quarters in 2013 and 2012 which resulted in the issuance of 187,224 shares, 667,342 shares and 634,162 shares in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter, bylaws, other agreements, and under Delaware law could discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of our company.\nProvisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay, or prevent a merger or acquisition involving us that our stockholders may consider favorable. These provisions include but are not limited to the right of our Board to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, no stockholder ability to fill director vacancies, elimination of the rights of our stockholders to act by written consent and call special stockholder meetings, super-majority vote requirements for certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation and stockholder proposals for amendments to our bylaws, prohibition against stockholders from removing directors other than \u201cfor cause\u201d and rules regarding how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings.\nWe are also subject to the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Under these provisions, if anyone becomes an \u201cinterested stockholder,\u201d we may not enter into a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with that person for three years without special approval, which could discourage a third-party from making a takeover offer and could delay or prevent a change in control of us. An \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d generally means (subject to certain exceptions as described in the Delaware General Corporation Law) someone owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock or an affiliate of ours that owned 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock during the past three years.\nIn addition, we have adopted a stockholder rights plan. Under the stockholder rights plan, if any party acquires 20% or more, of our outstanding common stock while the stockholder rights plan remains in place, subject to a number of exceptions set forth in the plan, the holders of these rights, other than the party acquiring the 20% position, will be able to purchase shares of our common stock, or other securities or assets, at a discounted price, causing substantial dilution to the party acquiring the 20% position. Following the acquisition of 20% or more of our stock by any person, without a redemption of the rights or a termination of the stockholder rights plan by our Board, if we are acquired by or merged with any other entity, holders of these rights, other than the party acquiring the 20% position, will also be able to purchase shares of common stock of the acquiring or surviving entity if the stockholder rights plan continues to remain in place. Our stockholder rights plan could discourage a takeover attempt and make the consummation of an unsolicited tender offer for shares of our common stock more difficult. As a result, without the approval of our Board, you may not have the opportunity to sell your shares to a potential acquirer of us at a premium over prevailing market prices. This could reduce the market price of our stock.\nBecause we do not intend to pay dividends, our stockholders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value.\nWe intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to finance the expansion of our business and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, the success of an investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon any future appreciation. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders purchased their shares.\nThe ownership of our common stock is highly concentrated.\nThree of our stockholders beneficially own of approximately 42% of our outstanding common stock, in the aggregate, as of February 27, 2015, as determined based on a review of their reports on Schedule 13D/A and Schedule 13G. As a result, these stockholders will be able to affect the outcome of, or exert significant influence over, all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors and any change in control. In particular, this concentration of ownership of our common stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us or otherwise discouraging or preventing a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us. This, in turn, could have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock. It could also prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over the market prices for their shares of common stock. Moreover, the interests of this concentration of ownership may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders. The concentration of ownership also contributes to the low trading volume and volatility of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 78071, "SIC": 3843, "TIC": "BIOL"}
