{"cik": "876523", "company": "EZCORP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-12-14", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nThere are many risks and uncertainties that may affect our operations, performance, development and results. Many of these risks are beyond our control. The following is a description of the important risk factors that may affect our business. If any of these risks were to actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have exposure to Grupo Finmart through promissory notes that we received as part of the divestiture transaction. Our ability to recover those notes is heavily dependent on the success and performance of the Grupo Finmart business and the guarantee of AlphaCredit.\nAs described in Note 3 and Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in \u201cPart II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplemental Data,\u201d we received various promissory notes, having an aggregate principal amount of approximately $89.8 million, in connection with the completion of the sale of Grupo Finmart in September 2016. Some, but not all, of these promissory notes are guaranteed by Alpha Holding, S.A. de C.V. (\u201cAlphaCredit\u201d), and some are secured by specific portfolios of consumer loans. These promissory notes are repayable in various amounts through September 2019. Our ability to recover full payment of these promissory notes over the next three years is dependent on AlphaCredit\u2019s and Grupo Finmart\u2019s ability to pay the notes, which is heavily dependent on the success and performance of the Grupo Finmart business. To the extent that AlphaCredit and Grupo Finmart do not repay the promissory notes, our financial performance and cash flows would be adversely affected.\nIf our assessment of and expectations concerning various factors affecting the collectability of these notes receivable change in the future, we may be required to record an allowance for losses or otherwise impair the carrying value the notes, which could adversely affect our financial performance in the period of recordation or impairment. These notes receivable were recorded at fair value on the date of the sale of Grupo Finmart, which initially accounted for the risk of default. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in \u201cPart II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d\nChanges in laws and regulations affecting our products and services could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance.\nOur products and services are subject to regulation under various federal, state and local laws and regulations. Adverse legislation or regulations could be adopted in any country, state or municipality in which we operate. If such legislation or regulation is adopted in any particular jurisdiction, we generally evaluate our business in the context of the new rules and determine whether we can continue to operate in that jurisdiction with new or modified products or whether it is feasible to enhance our business with additional product offerings. In any case, if we are unable to continue to operate profitably under the new rules, we may decide to close or consolidate stores, resulting in decreased revenues, earnings and assets.\nThe U.S. Department of Defense has issued rules that expand certain protections under the Military Lending Act, including a 36% APR rate cap, to a wider range of credit products, including pawn loans. These rules became effective in October 2016. The effective interest rate on our pawn loans varies by state, but in all cases, exceeds 36% APR. Consequently, active military personnel are unable to access our pawn loans. The implementation of this rule could have a significant adverse impact on our business at certain locations, but is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Company as a whole.\nLitigation and regulatory proceedings could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe are currently subject to various litigation and regulatory actions, including those described in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in \u201cPart II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d These matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur, which could include monetary damages or other relief. Any unfavorable ruling or outcome could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and could negatively affect our reputation.\nWe have procured management liability insurance policies that should protect us from much of the potential exposure related to the shareholder derivative litigation and the federal securities litigation described in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in \u201cPart II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d However, under the terms of those policies, we bear the first $1 million of costs or liability associated with each claim, and there are elements of the defense costs that are not covered under the insurance policies. In addition, to the extent that our ultimate liability in the current litigation or any subsequent litigation that is included in the same policy year exceeds the management liability policy limits, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOne person beneficially owns all of our voting stock and controls the outcome of all matters requiring a vote of stockholders, which may influence the value of our publicly-traded non-voting stock.\nPhillip E. Cohen is the beneficial owner of all of our Class B Voting Common Stock. As a result of his equity ownership stake, Mr. Cohen controls the outcome of all issues requiring a vote of stockholders and has the ability to appoint or remove directors and officers who control our policies and operations. All of our publicly-traded stock is non-voting stock. Consequently, stockholders other than Mr. Cohen have no vote with respect to the election of directors or any other matter requiring a vote of stockholders except as required by law. This lack of voting rights may adversely affect the market value of our publicly-traded Class A Non-Voting Common Stock.\nA significant portion of our business is concentrated in Texas.\nAs of September 30, 2016, a significant portion of our U.S. pawn stores were located in Texas, and those stores account for a significant portion of our revenues and profitability. The legislative, regulatory and general business environment in Texas has been relatively favorable for our pawn business activities, but a negative legislative or regulatory change in Texas could have a material adverse effect on our overall operations and financial performance.\nA significant or sudden decrease in gold values or the volume of gold transactions may have a material impact on our earnings and financial position.\nGold jewelry comprises a large portion of the collateral security for our pawn loans and our inventory. Pawn service charges, sales proceeds and our ability to liquidate excess jewelry inventory at an acceptable margin are dependent upon gold values and the volume of gold transactions. A decline in the availability of gold or our customers\u2019 willingness or ability to sell us gold or use gold as collateral for pawn loans could impact our business. Over the fiscal 2013 to 2015 periods and into fiscal 2016, we experienced a significant softening of gold prices and volumes in the aggregate, which had a negative impact on our profitability. The impact on our financial position and results of operations of a continued decrease in gold values or volumes or a change in customer behavior cannot be reasonably estimated because the market and customer response to changes in gold values is not known; however, a significant decline in gold values or gold volumes could result in decreases in sales, sales margins and pawn service charge revenues.\nA significant change in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse impact on our earnings and financial position.\nWe have foreign operations in Mexico and Canada and an equity investment in Australia. Our assets and investments in, and earnings and dividends from, each of these must be translated to U.S. dollars from their respective functional currencies. A significant weakening of any of these foreign currencies could result in lower assets and earnings in U.S. dollars, resulting in a potentially material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn part, achievement of our growth objectives is dependent upon our ability to open and acquire new stores.\nOur expansion strategy includes acquiring existing stores and opening de novo store locations. Our acquisition strategy is dependent upon the availability of attractive acquisition candidates, while the success of our de novo store strategy is contingent upon numerous factors that cannot be predicted or controlled, such as the availability of acceptable locations with a desirable customer base, the negotiation of acceptable lease terms, the ability to obtain required government permits and licenses and the existence of a suitable competitive environment. The achievement of our growth objectives is also subject to our ability to attract, train and retain qualified team members. Failure to achieve our expansion goals could adversely affect our prospects and future results of operations.\nChanges in the business, regulatory or political climate in Mexico could adversely affect our operations there, which could adversely affect our growth plans.\nOur growth plans include potential expansion in Latin America. Changes in the business, regulatory or political climate in Mexico, or significant fluctuations in currency exchange rates, could affect our ability to expand or continue our operations there, which could have a material adverse impact on our prospects, results of operations and cash flows.\nFluctuations in our sales, pawn loan balances, sales margins and pawn redemption rates could have a material adverse impact on our operating results.\nWe regularly experience fluctuations in a variety of operating metrics. Changes in any of these metrics, as might be caused by changes in the economic environment, competitive pressures, changes in customers\u2019 tastes and preferences or a significant decrease in gold prices could materially and adversely affect our profitability and ability to achieve our planned results of operations.\nChanges in our liquidity and capital requirements or in banks\u2019 abilities or willingness to lend to us could limit our ability to achieve our plans.\nA significant reduction in cash flows from operations or the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect our ability to achieve our planned growth and operating results. During fiscal 2014, we completed the sale of $230 million principal amount of 2.125% Cash Convertible Senior Notes Due 2019 and used the proceeds to, among other things, pay all outstanding amounts under, and terminate, our revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks. During fiscal 2016, we obtained a term loan facility of $100 million principal amount, at variable interest, of which we have drawn $50 million. Our ability to obtain additional credit or alternative financing, if needed, will depend upon market conditions, our financial condition and banks\u2019 or other lenders\u2019 willingness to lend capital at acceptable rates. The inability to access capital at acceptable rates and terms could restrict or limit our ability to achieve our growth objectives, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in competition from various sources could have a material adverse impact on our ability to achieve our plans.\nWe encounter significant competition from other pawn stores, other consumer lending companies and other retailers, many of which have significantly greater financial resources than we do. Increases in the number or size of competitors or other changes in competitive influences could adversely affect our operations.\nInfrastructure failures and breaches in data security could harm our business.\nWe depend on our information technology infrastructure to achieve our business objectives. If a problem, such as a computer virus, intentional disruption by a third party, natural disaster, telecommunications system failure or lost connectivity impairs our infrastructure, we may be unable to process transactions or otherwise carry on our business. An infrastructure disruption could damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers and revenue, result in the unintentional disclosure of company or customer information and require us to incur significant expense to eliminate these problems and address related data security concerns.\nWe invest in companies for strategic reasons and may not realize a return on our investments.\nWe currently have a significant investment in Cash Converters International Limited, which is a publicly-traded company based in Australia. We have made this investment, and may in the future make additional investments in this or other companies, to further our strategic objectives. The success of these strategic investments is dependent on a variety of factors, including the business performance of the companies in which we invest and the market\u2019s assessment of that performance. If the business performance of any of these companies suffers, then the value of our investment may decline. We wrote down a portion of our investment in Cash Converters International Limited during the fourth quarter of both fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015. See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in \u201cPart II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplemental Data.\u201d If we determine that any future other-than-temporary declines in the fair value exist for one of our equity investments, we will be required to write down that investment to its fair value and recognize the related write-down as an investment loss. Any future realized investment loss would adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may incur property, casualty or other losses not covered by insurance.\nWe maintain a program of insurance coverage for various types of property, casualty and other risks. The types and amounts of insurance that we obtain vary from time to time, depending on availability, cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention. The policies are subject to deductibles and exclusions that result in our retention of a level of risk on a self-insurance basis. Losses not covered by insurance could be substantial and may increase our expenses, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur acquisitions, investments and other transactions could disrupt our ongoing business and harm our results of operations.\nIn pursuing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate opportunities and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions, investments and other transactions. These transactions may involve significant challenges and risks, including risks that we may not realize the expected return on an acquisition or investment, that we may not be able to retain key personnel of an acquired business, or that we may experience difficulty in integrating acquired businesses into our business systems and processes. If we do enter into agreements with respect to acquisitions, investments or other transactions, we may fail to complete them due to inability to obtain required regulatory or other approvals or other factors. Furthermore, acquisitions, investments and other transactions require substantial management resources and have the potential to divert our attention from our existing business. These factors could harm our business and results of operations.\nWe could be subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new tax laws in the U.S. or other countries, or exposure to additional tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to taxes in the U.S. and several foreign jurisdictions. Current economic and political conditions make tax rates in any of these jurisdictions subject to significant change. Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation.\nEvents beyond our control could result in business interruption or other adverse effects on our operations and growth.\nOur business or operations could be subject to interruption or damage due to inclement weather, natural disaster, power loss, acts of violence, terrorist attacks, war or similar events. Such events could impair our customers' access to our business, impact our ability to expand or continue our operations or otherwise have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nGoodwill comprises a significant portion of our total assets. We assess goodwill for impairment at least annually, which could result in a material, non-cash write-down and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial conditions.\nThe carrying value of our goodwill is $254 million, or approximately 26% of our total assets, as of September 30, 2016. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 350-20-35 Goodwill - Subsequent Measurement, we test goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life for potential impairment annually, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, a change in strategic direction, legal factors, operating performance indicators, a change in the competitive environment, the sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit, or future economic factors such as unfavorable changes in the estimated future discounted cash flows of our reporting units. Our annual goodwill impairment test is performed in the fourth quarter utilizing the income approach. This approach uses future cash flows and estimated terminal values for each of our reporting units (discounted using a market participant perspective) to determine the fair value of each reporting unit, which is then compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if there is an impairment. The income approach includes assumptions about revenue growth rates, operating margins and terminal growth rates discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital derived from other publicly-traded companies that are similar but not identical from an operational and economic standpoint. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in \u201cPart II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for a discussion of the impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets during fiscal 2016.\nWe may be exposed to liabilities under applicable anti-corruption laws, and any determination that we violated these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to various anti-corruption laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have business in countries and regions that are less developed and are generally recognized as potentially more corrupt business environments. Our activities in these countries create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees or agents that could be in violation of various anti-corruption laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \"FCPA\"). We have implemented safeguards and policies to discourage these practices by our employees and agents. However, our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective, and our employees or agents may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. If employees violate our policies or we fail to maintain adequate record-keeping and internal accounting practices to accurately record our transactions, we may be subject to regulatory sanctions. Violations of the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties, and we may be subject to other liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We engage professional service firms with relevant expertise to perform certain reviews of our compliance under the FCPA.\nWe face other risks discussed under \"Part II, Item 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\"", "PERMNO": 76798, "SIC": 5900, "TIC": "EZPW"}
