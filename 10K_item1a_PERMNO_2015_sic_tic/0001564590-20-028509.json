{"cik": "1409375", "company": "ORION ENERGY SYSTEMS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-06-05", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below and in other reports that we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The matters discussed in the following risk factors, and additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nOur business is currently, and could be in the future, negatively impacted by the recent Coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) outbreak.\nAn outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19 has severely restricted the level of economic activity around the world. In response to this COVID-19 outbreak, the governments of many countries, states, cities and other geographic regions have taken preventative or protective actions, such as imposing restrictions on travel and business operations. Temporary closures of businesses have been ordered and numerous other businesses have temporarily closed voluntarily. These measures, while intended to protect human life, are expected to have significant adverse impacts on domestic and foreign economies of uncertain severity and duration. The current outbreak or continued spread of COVID-19 has caused an economic slowdown, and it is possible that it could cause a global recession. Currently, the effectiveness of economic stabilization efforts being taken to mitigate the effects of these actions and the spread of COVID-19 is uncertain.\nA public health pandemic, including COVID-19, poses the risk that we and our affiliates, employees, suppliers, customers and others may be prevented from conducting business activities for an indefinite period of time, including as a result of shutdowns, travel restrictions and other actions that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities. Such actions may prevent us from accessing the facilities of our customers to deliver and install products, provide services and complete maintenance. In addition, we have experienced customers choosing to delay projects, and in the future our customers may choose to further delay or cancel projects, on which we provide products and/or services as a result of such actions. Further, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, disruptions or delays in our supply chain as a result of such actions. While a substantial portion of our businesses have been classified as an essential business in jurisdictions in which facility closures have been mandated, we can give no assurance that this will not change in the future or that our businesses will be classified as essential in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate.\nThis COVID-19 outbreak has impacted, and may continue to impact, our office and manufacturing locations, as well as those of its third-party vendors, including through the effects of facility closures, reductions in operating hours and other social distancing efforts. For example, we have modified its business practices (including employee travel, employee work locations, and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences), and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, and suppliers. These modifications to our business practices, including any future actions we take, may cause us to experience reductions in productivity and disruptions to our business routines. For example, we temporarily suspended operations at our manufacturing facility after one of our employees tested positive for COVID-19 in order to conduct a deep clean of the facility in order to ensure the safety of our employees.\nOur management of the impact of COVID-19 has and will continue to require significant investment of time from our management and employees, as well as resources across our global enterprise. The focus on managing and mitigating the impacts of COVID-19 on our business may cause us to divert or delay the application of our resources toward new initiatives or investments, which may adversely impact our future results of operations. In addition, issues relating to the COVID-19 pandemic may result in legal claims or litigation against us.\nThe impact of COVID-19 has caused significant uncertainty and volatility in the credit markets. We rely on the credit markets to provide us with liquidity to operate and grow our businesses beyond the liquidity that operating cash flows provide. If our access to capital were to become significantly constrained or if costs of capital increased significantly due the impact of COVID-19, including volatility in the capital markets, a reduction in our credit ratings or other factors, then our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nWe may also experience impacts from market downturns and changes in consumer behavior related to pandemic fears and impacts on its workforce as a result of COVID-19. For example, we have experienced a recent decline in demand in our businesses as a result of the impact of efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19. If the COVID-19 pandemic becomes more pronounced in our markets or experiences a resurgence in markets recovering from the spread of COVID-19, or if another significant natural disaster or pandemic were to occur in the future, our operations in areas impacted by such events could experience further adverse financial impacts due to market changes and other resulting events and circumstances. The extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak further\nimpacts our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19, the longevity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain its impact or recurrence. The impact of COVID-19 may also exacerbate other risks discussed in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, any of which could have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAdverse conditions in the global economy have negatively impacted, and could in the future negatively impact, our customers, suppliers and business.\nOur operations and performance are impacted by worldwide economic conditions. Uncertainty about global economic conditions, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, have and could result in customers postponing purchases of our products and services in response to tighter credit, unemployment, negative financial news and/or declines in income or asset values and other macroeconomic factors, which could have a material negative effect on demand for our products and services and, accordingly, on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. For example, the Company has experienced a recent decline in demand in its businesses as a result of the impact of efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 and any economic and political uncertainty caused by the United States tariffs imposed on other countries, and any corresponding tariffs from such other countries in response, may negatively impact demand and/or increase the cost for our products and components used in our products.\nThere continues to be a great amount of debate regarding a wide range of policy options with respect to monetary, regulatory, and trade, amongst others, that the U.S. federal government has and may pursue, including the imposition of tariffs on certain imports. Certain sourced finished products and certain of the components used in our products are impacted by tariffs imposed on China imports. Our efforts to mitigate the impact of added costs include a variety of activities, such as sourcing from non-tariff impacted countries and raising prices. If we are unable to successfully mitigate the impacts of these tariffs and other trade policies, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, global economic and political uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has led many customers to adopt strategies for conserving cash, including limits on capital spending. Our lighting systems are often purchased as capital assets and therefore are subject to capital availability. Uncertainty around such availability, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, has led customers to delay purchase decisions, which has elongated the duration of our sales cycles. Weak economic conditions in the past have adversely affected our customers\u2019 capital budgets, purchasing decisions and facilities managers and, therefore, have adversely affected our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The return to a recessionary state of the global economy, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, could potentially have negative effects on our near-term liquidity and capital resources, including slower collections of receivables, delays of existing order deliveries, postponements of incoming orders and reductions in the number and volume of purchase orders received from key customers as a result of reduced capital expenditure budgets. Our business and results of operations will be adversely affected to the extent these adverse economic conditions affect our customers\u2019 purchasing decisions.\nAs we evolve our business strategy to increase our focus on new product and service offerings, including our IoT, \u201csmart-building\u201d, \u201cconnected ceilings\u201d and other related technology, software and controls products and services, the nature of our business may be significantly changed, or transformed, and our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nOur future growth and profitability are tied in part to our ability to successfully bring to market new and innovative product and service offerings. We have begun to evolve our business strategy to focus on further expanding the nature and scope of our products and services offered to our customers. This expansion of products and services includes pursuing projects to develop recurring revenue streams, including providing lighting and electrical maintenance services and utilizing control sensor technology to collect data and assisting customers in the digitization of this data, along with other potential services. We also plan to pursue the expansion of our IoT \u201csmart-building\u201d and \u201cconnected ceiling\u201d and other related technology, software and control products and services we offer to our customers. We currently plan on investing significant time, resources and capital into expanding our offerings in these areas with no expectation that they will result in us realizing material revenue in the near term and without any assurance they will succeed or be profitable. In fact, it is likely that these efforts will reduce our profitability, at least in the near term as we invest resources and incur expenses to develop these offerings. Moreover, we expect that as we continue to explore, develop and refine new offerings, market preferences will continue to evolve, our offerings may not generate sufficient interest by end customers and we may be unable to\ncompete effectively with existing or new competitors, generate sufficient revenues or achieve or maintain acceptable levels of profitability.\nIf we are successful in introducing new product and services offerings, including technology, software and controls, the nature of our business may significantly change or be transformed away from being principally products focused. Additionally, our experience with technology, software and controls products and services is limited. If we do not successfully execute our strategy or anticipate the needs of our customers, our credibility as a provider of technology, software and controls products could be questioned and our prospects for future revenue growth and profitability may never materialize.\nAs we expand our product and services offerings to new markets, the overall complexity of our business will likely increase at an accelerated rate and we may become subject to different market dynamics. The new markets into which we are expanding, or may expand, may have different characteristics from the markets in which we historically competed. These different characteristics may include, among other things, rapidly changing technologies, different manufacturing capabilities, different supply chains, different methods of competition, new product development rates, client concentrations and performance and compatibility requirements. We do not have the current expertise to address many of these characteristics. Our failure to make the necessary adaptations to our business model to address these different characteristics, complexities and new market dynamics could adversely affect our operating results.\nAccordingly, if we fail to successfully launch, manage and maintain our refocused business strategy, our future revenue growth and profitability may be limited and our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nWe do not have major sources of recurring revenue and we depend upon a limited number of customers in any given period to generate a substantial portion of our revenue. The loss of any significant customers or a major customer could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe do not have long-term contracts with our customers that provide us with recurring revenue from period to period. We generate a substantial portion of our revenue by securing large retrofit and multi-facility roll-out projects from new and existing customers. As a result, our dependence on individual key customers can vary from period to period due to the significant size of some of our retrofit and multi-facility roll-out projects. Our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 83%, 48%, and 42% respectively, of our total revenue in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018. In fiscal 2019, one customer accounted for 20.7% of total revenue. In fiscal 2020, this customer accounted for 74.1% of our total revenue. We expect that we will continue to experience significant customer concentration in fiscal 2021. The loss of our largest customer or our failure to satisfy its installation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, as well as on our reputation and our ability to execute our business strategy. We expect large retrofit and rollout projects to continue to remain a significant component of our total revenue.\nThe multi-location master retrofit agreements we enter into with several of our key customers (including our current largest customer) generally require that the customer issue individual retrofit location work orders or purchase orders before we may provide our products and services at that individual retrofit location. These master agreements do not guarantee that our key customers will make individual location purchases from us and they also generally allow any purchase order or work order to be terminated prior to shipment. As a result, the relative amount and concentration of our revenues may fluctuate year over year and period over period depending on the number of purchase orders or work orders issued by our key customers, which may fluctuate due to factors such as our customers\u2019 capital expenditure budgets and general economic conditions. In addition, in order to provide quality and timely service under our multi-location master retrofit agreements we are required to make substantial working capital expenditures and advance inventory purchases that we may not be able to recoup if the agreements or a substantial volume of purchase orders under the agreements are delayed or terminated. For example, while we received a master retrofit agreement in January 2020 for additional revenue of $18-20 million for our largest customer, due to the closure of its facilities to external activities because of the COVID-19 pandemic, this customer deferred retrofit installations for a significant portion of its locations in March 2020, thereby resulting in the deferral of our realization of substantial expected revenue during our fiscal 2020 fourth quarter, The loss of, or substantial reduction in sales to, any of our significant customers, or a major customer, or the termination or delay of a significant volume of purchase orders by one or more key customers, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in any given future period.\nOur evolving business strategy includes actively exploring potential acquisitions, including potential acquisitions that could significantly change, or even transform, the nature of our business. These acquisitions could be unsuccessful or consume significant resources, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nAs discussed in \u201cOur Growth Strategies,\u201d we are actively exploring potential business acquisitions which would more quickly add expanded and different capabilities to our product and services offerings, including potential acquisitions that could significantly change, or even transform, the nature of our business. There can be no assurance that we will identify or successfully complete any transactions with one or more suitable acquisition candidates in the future. Nor can there be any assurance that any completed acquisitions will be successful. Acquisitions may involve significant cash expenditures, debt incurrence, stock issuances, operating losses and expenses that that would otherwise be directed to investments in our existing business and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. To pursue acquisitions and other strategic transactions, we may need to raise additional debt and/or equity capital in the future, which may not be available on acceptable terms, in sufficient amounts or at all. In addition, we may issue new shares of our common stock as consideration in such transactions, which may have a dilutive impact on our existing shareholders and may also result in a reduction in the market price of our shares once those newly issued shares are resold in the market. In addition, acquisitions involve numerous other risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe failure to achieve the acquisition's revenue or profit forecasts;\n\u2022\nthe business culture of the acquired business may not match well with our culture;\n\u2022\nour business strategies and focus may change in ways that adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows;\n\u2022\ntechnological and product synergies, economies of scale and cost reductions may not occur as expected;\n\u2022\nunforeseen expenses, delays or conditions may result from the acquisition, including required regulatory approvals or consents;\n\u2022\npotential changes may result to our management team and/or board of directors;\n\u2022\nwe may acquire or assume unexpected liabilities or be subject to unexpected penalties or other enforcement actions;\n\u2022\nfaulty assumptions may be made regarding the macroeconomic environment or the integration process that form a basis for the acquisition;\n\u2022\nunforeseen difficulties, delays and costs may arise in integrating operations, processes and systems;\n\u2022\nhigher than expected investments may be required to implement necessary compliance processes and related systems, including information technology systems, accounting systems and internal controls over financial reporting;\n\u2022\nwe may fail to retain, motivate and integrate key management and other employees of the acquired business;\n\u2022\nhigher than expected costs may arise due to unforeseen changes in tax, trade, environmental, labor, safety, payroll or pension policies in any jurisdiction in which the acquired business conducts its operations;\n\u2022\nwe may adversely impact our sales channels and our sales channel partners; and\n\u2022\nwe may experience problems in retaining customers and integrating customer bases.\nMany of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs and reduced profitability, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention. They may also delay, decrease or eliminate the realization of some or all of the benefits we anticipate when we enter into a transaction.\nBecause we have only made one acquisition to date, our ability to do so successfully is unproven. Moreover, our management team has limited experience in, and limited time to dedicate to, pursuing, negotiating or integrating acquisitions. If we do identify suitable candidates, we may not be able to negotiate or consummate such acquisitions on favorable terms or at all. Any acquisitions we complete may not achieve their initially intended results and benefits and may be viewed negatively by investors and other stakeholders.\nWe may undertake acquisitions financed in part through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities, including through the new issuance of our common stock or debt securities as consideration in an acquisition transaction. Such\nacquisition financing could result in dilution to our current shareholders, result in a decrease in our earnings and/or adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity or other leverage measures.\nIn addition to committing additional capital resources to complete any acquisitions, substantial additional capital may be required to operate the acquired businesses following their acquisition. Moreover, these acquisitions may result in significant financial losses if the intended objectives of the transactions are not achieved. Some of the businesses we may acquire may have significant operating and financial challenges, requiring significant additional capital commitments to overcome such challenges and adversely affecting our financial condition and liquidity.\nFailure to implement our acquisition strategy, including successfully integrating acquired businesses, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to obtain equity capital or debt financing necessary to effectively pursue our evolving strategy and sustain our growth initiatives.\nOur existing liquidity and capital resources may not be sufficient to allow us to effectively pursue our evolving growth strategy, complete potential acquisitions or otherwise fund or sustain our growth initiatives. As of March 31, 2020, we had $28.8 million of cash, approximately $10 million of outstanding borrowings and $1.2 million of remaining borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility, compared to $8.7 million of cash, approximately $9.2 million of outstanding borrowings and $1.4 million of remaining borrowing availability as of March 31, 2019. If we require additional capital resources, we may not be able to obtain sufficient equity capital and/or debt financing on acceptable terms or conditions, or at all. Factors affecting the availability to us of additional equity capital or debt financing on acceptable terms and conditions, or in sufficient amounts, include:\n\u2022\nOur history of operating losses prior to our fiscal 2020;\n\u2022\nOur current and future financial results and condition;\n\u2022\nOur limited collateral availability;\n\u2022\nOur current customer concentration;\n\u2022\nThe market\u2019s, investors\u2019 and lenders' view of our company, industry and products;\n\u2022\nThe perception in the equity and debt markets of our ability to execute and sustain our business plan or achieve our operating results expectations; and\n\u2022\nThe price, volatility and trading volume and history of our common stock.\nOur inability to obtain the equity capital or debt financing necessary to pursue our evolving growth strategy could force us to scale back our growth initiatives or abandon potential acquisitions. If we are unable to pursue our evolving growth strategy and growth initiatives, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nUntil fiscal 2020, we had a history of losses and negative cash flow and we may be unable to sustain our recent profitability or positive cash flows in the future, particularly in fiscal 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nPrior to fiscal 2020, we experienced net losses and negative cash flow for the prior five fiscal years. Although we achieved substantial profitability and positive cash flow in fiscal 2020, continuing to sustain our fiscal 2020 levels of net income and positive cash flows in the future will depend on our ability to successfully complete and execute our strategic plan. Moreover, the duration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may again make it difficult for us to achieve profitability and positive cash flows in our fiscal 2021. There is no guarantee that we will be able to sustain our profitability or positive cash flows in the future, particularly in fiscal 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our inability to successfully sustain our profitability and positive cash flows could materially and adversely affect our ability to pursue our evolving strategy and growth initiatives.\nThe success of our business depends upon market acceptance of our energy management products and services.\nOur future success depends upon the continued market acceptance of our energy management products and services and obtaining additional project management retrofit master contracts, as well as customer orders for new and expanded products and services to supplement our master contract with our current single largest customer. If we are unable to convince current and potential\nnew customers of the advantages of our lighting systems and energy management products and services, or our expanded product and services offerings, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows will likely be materially adversely affected. In addition, because the market for energy management products and services, as well as potential new customer uses for our products and services, is rapidly evolving, we may not be able to accurately assess the size of the market, and we may have limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business. If the market for our lighting systems and energy management products and services, as well as potential new customer uses for our products and services, does not continue to develop as we anticipate, or if the market does not accept our products or services, then our ability to grow our business could be limited and we may not be able to increase our revenue and our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows will likely be materially adversely affected.\nThe success of our business depends upon our adaptation to the quickly changing market conditions in the lighting industry and on market acceptance of our lighting retrofit solutions using new LED and control technologies.\nThe market for lighting products has experienced a significant technology shift to LED lighting systems. In addition, we continue to explore utilizing our system platform as a \u201cconnected ceiling\u201d or \u201csmart ceiling\u201d, or a framework or network that can support the installation and integration of other business technology or data information solutions on our lighting platform.\nAs a result, our future success depends significantly upon the adoption rate of LED products and related control technologies within our primary markets, our ability to participate in this ongoing market trend and our ability to expand into complementary markets. To be an effective participant in the LED market, we must keep up with the evolution of LED and related technologies, which continue to move at a fast pace. We may be unable to successfully develop and market new products or services that keep pace with technological or industry changes, differentiate ourselves from our competition, satisfy changes in customer demands or comply with present or emerging government and industry regulations and technology standards. The development and introduction of new products and services may result in increased warranty expenses and other new product and services introduction expenses. In addition, we will likely continue to incur substantial costs to research and develop new products and services, which will increase our expenses, without guarantee that our new products and services will be commercially viable. We may also spend time and resources to develop and release new products and services only to discover that a competitor has also introduced similar new products and services with superior performance, at a lower price or on better delivery terms. Moreover, if new sources of lighting or lighting-based solutions or related technologies are developed, our current products and technologies could become less competitive or obsolete, which could result in reduced revenue, reduced earnings or increased losses and/or inventory and other impairment charges.\nAs we attempt to adapt and respond to this quickly evolving market, we have been managing through significant change in our vendor supply chain for our LED product line. While we have attempted to negotiate lower material input costs to help maintain or improve our LED product gross margins, we may not be able to realize any gross margin benefits in the amounts or on the timetable anticipated and we may experience higher warranty expenses in the future as we implement our manufacturing and assembly process changes. It is also possible that, as we focus more of our sales efforts on new products and services, we may increase our risk of inventory obsolescence for outmoded LED or controls products.\nFinally, in connection with our historical primary focus on selling our LED products and related control technologies, we expect our results of operations to continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter as customers may delay purchasing decisions as they evaluate their return on investment from purchasing new LED and/or control products compared to alternative lighting and controls solutions, the pricing of LED products continues to fall and LED products continue to gain more widespread customer acceptance. Similarly, these circumstances have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our product gross margins and our profitability from quarter to quarter.\nIf we are unable to achieve market acceptance of our lighting retrofit solutions using LED technologies and our system platform as a \u201cconnected ceiling\u201d or \u201csmart ceiling\u201d or realize the expected benefits from our focus on promoting new products and services, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows will likely be materially adversely affected.\nThe success of our LED lighting retrofit solutions and related controls technologies depend, in part, on our ability to claim market share away from our competitors. If we are unable to expand our customer base and increase sales in our targeted markets, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows will likely be materially adversely affected.\nParticipants in the LED market who are able to quickly establish customer relationships and achieve market penetration are likely to gain a competitive advantage as the lighting retrofit solutions offered by us and our competitors generally have a product life of several years following installation. If we are unable to broaden our customer base and achieve greater market penetration in the\nLED market in a timely manner, we may lose the opportunity to market our LED products and services and related controls technologies to significant portions of the lighting systems retrofit market for several years and may be at a disadvantage in securing future business opportunities from customers that have previously established relationships with one or more of our competitors. These circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn addition, as we continue to seek to expand our customer base within our national account, agent and ESCO sales channels, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain talent to execute on our sales model. If we are unable to attract and retain sufficient talent, we may be unable to broaden our customer base, which will adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe increasingly rely on third-party manufacturers for the manufacture and development of our products and product components.\nWe have increased our utilization of third-party manufacturers for the manufacture and development of our products and product components. As a result, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if our third-party manufacturers were to experience problems with product quality, credit or liquidity issues, or disruptions or delays in their manufacturing process or delivery of the finished products and components or the raw materials used to make such products and components.\nWe rely on third-parties to provide our controls technology products and services.\nWe rely third-party service providers to provide our controls technology products and services to our customers. If any of these service providers stop providing us with access to their products, platforms and services, fail to provide these services to us on a cost-effective basis, cease operations, or otherwise terminate these services, the delay caused by qualifying and switching to another third-party product or service provider, if one is available, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if our third-party providers were to experience problems with product quality, service quality, credit or liquidity issues, or disruptions or delays.\nIf problems occur with any of these third-party providers, it may cause errors or reduced quality in our services, and we could encounter difficulty identifying the source of the problem. The occurrence of errors or reduced quality in our controls products or services, whether caused by us a third-party provider, may result in the loss of our existing customers, delay or loss of market acceptance of our products and services or liability for failure to meet obligations under our agreements with customers, and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe rely on products obtained from third parties in order to offer our controls technology products and services. In some cases, we integrate third-party licensed software components into our platforms. This hardware and software may not continue to be available at reasonable prices or on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Any loss of the right to use any of this hardware or software could significantly increase our expenses and otherwise result in delays in the provisioning of our services until equivalent technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained and integrated. Any errors or defects in third-party hardware or software could result in errors or a failure of our service which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur continued emphasis on indirect distribution channels to sell our products and services to supplement our direct distribution channels has had limited success to date. If we are unable to attract, incentivize and retain our third-party distributors and sales agents, or our distributors and sales agents do not sell our products and services at the levels expected, our revenues could decline and our costs could increase.\nOver the past two fiscal years, we have significantly expanded the number of our manufacturer representative agencies that sell our products through distributors, many of which are not exclusive, which means that these sales agents and distributors may sell other third-party products and services in direct competition with us. Since many of our competitors, including those that are larger than us and have more established relationships, use sales agents and distributors to sell their products and services, competition for such agents and distributors is intense and may adversely affect our product pricing and gross margins. Additionally, due to mismanagement, industry trends, macro-economic developments, or other reasons, our sales agents and distributors may be unable to effectively sell our products at the levels desired or anticipated. In addition, we have historically relied on direct sales to sell our products and services, which were often made in competition with sales agents and distributors. In order to attract and form lasting\npartnerships with sales agents and distributors, we will be required to overcome our historical perception as a direct sales competitor. As a result, we may have difficulty attracting and retaining sales agents and distributors and any inability to do so could have a negative effect on our ability to attract and obtain customers, which could have an adverse impact on our business. In fiscal 2020, our indirect distribution channels did not achieve the level of success desired. As a result, we have modified our strategy in our indirect distribution channels to work more closely with distributors and contractors, usually in coordination with our agents. There can be no assurance that this modified strategy will be successful and may result in a further reduction in revenue through this distribution channel.\nOur financial performance is dependent on our ability to achieve increases in our average selling prices of our products.\nThe gross margins of our products can vary significantly, with margins generally ranging from 10% to 50%. While we continue to implement our strategy of transitioning to higher-margin products and reducing the material cost of our products, a change in the total mix of our sales toward lower margin products, a decrease in the margins on our products as a result of competitive pressures and lower cost imported products driving down the average selling price of our products, lower sales volumes, our substantial fixed manufacturing facility overhead and promotional programs to increase sales volumes could reduce our profitability and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Furthermore, average selling prices may be further negatively impacted by market over-supply conditions, product feature cannibalization by competitors or component providers, low-cost non-traditional sales methods by new market entrants, and comparison of our retrofit fixture products with replacement lamp equivalents. In our highly competitive lighting industry, we must be able to innovate and release new products on a regular basis with features and benefits that generate increases in our average selling prices and average gross margins. There can be no assurance we will be successful in achieving these goals.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and, if we are unable to compete successfully, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows will likely be materially adversely affected.\nWe face strong competition primarily from manufacturers and distributors of energy management products and services, as well as from ESCOs and electrical contractors. We are also facing increased imported products competition from manufacturers in low-cost countries. We compete primarily on the basis of customer relationships, price, quality, energy efficiency, customer service and marketing support. Our products are in direct competition with the expanding availability of LED products, HID technology, as well as HIF products and older fluorescent technology in the lighting systems retrofit market.\nMany of our competitors are better capitalized than we are, have strong customer relationships, greater name recognition, and more extensive engineering, manufacturing, sales and marketing capabilities. In addition, the LED market has seen increased convergence in recent years, resulting in our competition gaining increased market share and resources. Competitors could focus their substantial resources on developing a competing business model or energy management products or services that may be potentially more attractive to customers than our products or services. In addition, we may face competition from other products or technologies that reduce demand for electricity. Our competitors may also offer energy management products and services at reduced prices in order to improve their competitive positions. Any of these competitive factors could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain customers, or require us to lower our average selling prices in order to remain competitive, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe reduction or elimination of investments in, or incentives to adopt, LED lighting or the elimination of, or changes in, policies, incentives or rebates in certain states or countries that encourage the use of LEDs over some traditional lighting technologies could cause the growth in demand for our products to slow, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nReductions in (including as a result of any budgetary constraints), or the elimination of, government investment and favorable energy policies designed to accelerate the adoption of LED lighting could result in decreased demand for our products and decrease our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Further, if our products fail to qualify for any financial incentives or rebates provided by governmental agencies or utilities for which our competitors\u2019 products qualify, such programs may diminish or eliminate our ability to compete by offering products at lower prices than ours.\nThe elimination of, or changes in, policies, incentives or rebates in certain states that encourage the use of solar power over other traditional power sources could cause the revenue from our sale of solar-related tax credits to third parties to decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe have long-lived assets associated with our legacy solar business and recognize revenue from the sale to third parties of tax credits received from operating these solar assets. There is currently legislation pending which may decrease the future cash flows associated with the sale of these tax credits. Such a decrease could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Depending on the result of this pending legislation change, we may be required to record a non-cash impairment charge in a future period.\nChanges in government budget priorities and political gridlock, and future potential government shutdown, could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nActual and perceived changes in governmental budget priorities, and future potential government shutdown, could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Certain government agencies purchase certain products and services directly from us. When the government changes budget priorities, such as in times of war or financial crisis, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, or reallocates spending to areas unrelated to our business, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows can be negatively impacted. For example, demand and payment for our products and services may be affected by public sector budgetary cycles, funding authorizations or rebates. Funding reductions or delays, including delays caused by political gridlock and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and future potential government shutdown, could negatively impact demand and payment for our products and services. If any of these events occur, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nOur products use components and raw materials that may be subject to price fluctuations, shortages or interruptions of supply.\nWe may be vulnerable to price increases for components or raw materials that we require for our products, including aluminum, copper, certain rare earth minerals, electronic drivers, chips, ballasts, power supplies and lamps. In particular, our cost of aluminum can be subject to commodity price fluctuation. We also source certain finished goods externally. Limitations inherent within our supply chain of certain of these component parts, including competitive, governmental, and legal limitations, natural disasters, and other events, could impact costs, and future increases in the costs of these items, including, for example, the adoption of new tariffs by the United States and other countries and the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect our profitability and availability of raw materials or components, as there can be no assurance that future price increases will be successfully passed through to customers or that we will be able to find alternative suppliers. Further, suppliers' inventories of certain components that our products require may be limited and are subject to acquisition by others. As a result of disruption to our supply chain due to COVID-19, we have purchased quantities of certain components that are critical to our product manufacturing and that are in excess of our estimated near-term requirements as a result of supplier delivery constraints and concerns over component availability. We may need to continue to do so in the future. As a result, we have had, and may need to continue, to devote additional working capital to support component and raw material inventory that may not be used over a reasonable period to produce saleable products, and we may be required to increase our excess and obsolete inventory reserves to provide for these excess quantities, particularly if demand for our products does not meet our expectations. Also, any shortages or interruptions in the supply of our components or raw materials could disrupt our operations. If any of these events occur, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nOur ability to balance customer demand and capacity and increased employee turnover could negatively impact our business.\nIn addition, as customer demand for our products changes, we must be able to adjust our production capacity, including increasing or decreasing our employee workforce, to meet demand. We are continually taking steps to address our manufacturing capacity needs for our products. If we are not able to increase or decrease our production capacity at our targeted rate or if there are unforeseen costs associated with adjusting our capacity levels, our ability to execute our operating plan could be adversely affected.\nWe have, from time to time, experienced increased employee turnover. The increased turnover has resulted in the loss of numerous long-term employees, along with their institutional knowledge and expertise, and the reallocation of certain employment responsibilities, all of which could adversely affect operational efficiencies, employee performance and retention. Such turnover has also placed a significant burden on our continuing employees, has resulted in higher recruiting expenses as we have sought to recruit and train employees, and introduced increased instability in our operations as responsibilities were reallocated to new or different employees. To the extent that we are unable to effectively reallocate employee responsibilities, retain key employees and reduce employee turnover, our operations and our ability to execute our operating plan could be adversely affected.\nOur inability to attract and retain key employees, our reseller network members or manufacturer representative agencies could adversely affect our operations and our ability to execute on our operating plan and growth strategy.\nWe rely upon the knowledge, experience and skills of key employees throughout our organization, particularly our senior management team, our sales group that require technical knowledge or contacts in, and knowledge of, the LED industry, and our innovation and engineering team. In addition, our ability to attract talented new employees, particularly in our sales group and our innovation and engineering team, is also critical to our success. We also depend on our distribution channels and network of manufacturer representative agencies. If we are unable to attract and retain key employees, resellers, and manufacturer representative agencies because of competition or, in the case of employees, inadequate compensation or other factors, our results of operations and our ability to execute our operating plan could be adversely affected. In addition, if key employees terminate their employment, become ill as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, or if an insufficient number of employees are retained to maintain effective operations, our business activities may be adversely affected.\nIf our information technology systems security measures are breached or fail, our products may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop buying our products, we may incur significant legal and financial exposure, and our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nOur information technology systems involve the storage of our confidential information and trade secrets, as well as our customers\u2019 personal and proprietary information in our equipment, networks and corporate systems. Security breaches expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation and increased costs for security measures, loss of revenue, damage to our reputation and potential liability. Security breaches or unauthorized access may in the future result in a combination of significant legal and financial exposure, increased remediation and other costs, theft and/or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information, damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence in the security of our products, services and networks that could have an adverse effect upon our business. While we take steps to prevent unauthorized access to our corporate systems, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or sabotage systems change frequently or may be designed to remain dormant until a triggering event, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. Further, the risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks, or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments, and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as cyber-attacks have become more prevalent and harder to detect and fight against. In addition, hardware, software or applications we procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise network and data security. Any breach or failure of our information technology systems could result in decreased revenue, increased expenses, increased capital expenditures, customer dissatisfaction and potential lawsuits, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows\nIf our information technology systems fail, or if we experience an interruption in their operation, then our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nThe efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information technology systems. We rely on those systems generally to manage day-to-day operations, manage relationships with our customers, maintain our research and development data and maintain our financial and accounting records. The failure of our information technology systems, our inability to successfully maintain, enhance and/or replace our information technology systems, or any compromise of the integrity or security of the data we generate from our information technology systems, could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations, disrupt our business and product development and make us unable, or severely limit our ability, to respond to customer demands. In addition, our information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from:\n\u2022\nearthquake, fire, flood and other natural disasters;\n\u2022\nemployee or other theft;\n\u2022\nattacks by computer viruses or hackers;\n\u2022\npower outages; and\n\u2022\ncomputer systems, internet, telecommunications or data network failure.\nAny interruption of our information technology systems could result in decreased revenue, increased expenses, increased capital expenditures, customer dissatisfaction and potential lawsuits, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nProduct liability claims could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face exposure to product liability claims in the event that our energy management products fail to perform as expected or cause bodily injury or property damage. Since virtually all of our products use electricity, it is possible that our products could result in injury, whether by product malfunctions, defects, improper installation or other causes. Particularly because our products often incorporate new technologies or designs, we cannot predict whether or not product liability claims will be brought against us in the future or result in negative publicity about our business or adversely affect our customer relations. Moreover, we may not have adequate resources in the event of a successful claim against us. A successful product liability claim against us that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of our available insurance limits could require us to make significant payments of damages and could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur inability to protect our intellectual property, or our involvement in damaging and disruptive intellectual property litigation, could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows or result in the loss of use of the related product or service.\nWe attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as employee and third-party nondisclosure and assignment agreements. Our failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe own numerous United States patents and patent applications for some of our products, systems, business methods and technologies. We offer no assurance about the degree of protection which existing or future patents may afford us. Likewise, we offer no assurance that our patent applications will result in issued patents, that our patents will be upheld if challenged, that competitors will not develop similar or superior business methods or products outside the protection of our patents, that competitors will not infringe upon our patents, or that we will have adequate resources to enforce our patents. Effective protection of our United States patents may be unavailable or limited in jurisdictions outside the United States, as the intellectual property laws of foreign countries sometimes offer less protection or have onerous filing requirements. In addition, because some patent applications are maintained in secrecy for a period of time, we could adopt a technology without knowledge of a pending patent application, and such technology could infringe a third party\u2019s patent.\nWe also rely on unpatented proprietary technology. It is possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise learn of our unpatented technology. To protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information, we generally require employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements. We cannot assure you that these agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use, misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information. If we are unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nWe rely on our trademarks, trade names, and brand names to distinguish our company and our products and services from our competitors. Some of our trademarks may conflict with trademarks of other companies. Failure to obtain trademark registrations could limit our ability to protect our trademarks and impede our sales and marketing efforts. Further, we cannot assure you that competitors will not infringe our trademarks, or that we will have adequate resources to enforce our trademarks.\nIn addition, third parties may bring infringement and other claims that could be time-consuming and expensive to defend. Also, parties making infringement and other claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to provide our products, services or business methods and could cause us to pay substantial damages. In the event of a successful claim of infringement, we may need to obtain one or more licenses from third parties, which may not be available at a reasonable cost, or at all. It is possible that our intellectual property rights may not be valid or that we may infringe upon existing or future proprietary rights of others. Any successful infringement claims could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to seek licenses on unfavorable terms, prevent us from manufacturing or selling products, services and business methods and require us to redesign or, in the case of trademark claims, re-brand our company or products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are subject to financial and operating covenants in our credit agreement and any failure to comply with such covenants, or obtain waivers in the event of non-compliance, could limit our borrowing availability under the credit agreement, resulting in our being unable to borrow under our credit agreement and materially adversely impact our liquidity.\nOur credit agreement with Western Alliance Bank contains provisions that limit our future borrowing availability and require us to maintain a minimum amount of cash on deposit and available borrowing capacity under such credit agreement as of the end of each month. The credit agreement also contains other customary covenants, including certain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, consolidate or merge, enter into acquisitions, make investments, pay any dividend or distribution on our stock, redeem, repurchase or retire shares of our stock, or pledge or dispose of assets.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the financial and other covenants in our credit agreement. Our failure to comply with these covenants could cause us to be unable to borrow under the credit agreement and may constitute an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of the maturity of any indebtedness then outstanding under the credit agreement, which would require us to pay all amounts then outstanding. Such an event could materially adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity. Additionally, such events of non-compliance could impact the terms of any additional borrowings and/or any credit renewal terms. Any failure to comply with such covenants may be a disclosable event and may be perceived negatively. Such perception could adversely affect the market price for our common stock and our ability to obtain financing in the future.\nOur retrofitting process frequently involves responsibility for the removal and disposal of components containing hazardous materials.\nWhen we retrofit a customer\u2019s facility, we typically assume responsibility for removing and disposing of its existing lighting fixtures. Certain components of these fixtures typically contain trace amounts of mercury and other hazardous materials. Older components may also contain trace amounts of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs. We currently rely on contractors to remove the components containing such hazardous materials at the customer job site. The contractors then arrange for the disposal of such components at a licensed disposal facility. Failure by such contractors to remove or dispose of the components containing these hazardous materials in a safe, effective and lawful manner could give rise to liability for us, or could expose our workers or other persons to these hazardous materials, which could result in claims against us which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe cost of compliance with environmental laws and regulations and any related environmental liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing, among other things, emissions to air, discharge to water, the remediation of contaminated properties and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of, and exposure to, waste and other materials, as well as laws and regulations relating to occupational health and safety. These laws and regulations frequently change, and the violation of these laws or regulations can lead to substantial fines, penalties and other liabilities. The operation of our manufacturing facility entails risks in these areas and there can be no assurance that we will not incur material costs or liabilities in the future that could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur corporate office building is currently listed for sale or lease; any sale of our building will likely result in a non-cash impairment charge.\nWe currently own, but have listed for sale or lease, our corporate office building in Manitowoc, Wisconsin. We evaluate long-lived assets, including property, plant, and equipment, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets recognized in our financial statements may not be recoverable; as of March 31, 2020, the value of our long-lived assets was deemed recoverable. However, any sale of our building will likely result in a non-cash impairment charge, as the building is currently listed for sale at a price below its net book value and, as a result, will have an adverse impact on our results of operations during the period the impairment charge is incurred.\nOur net operating loss carryforwards provide a future benefit only if we are profitable and may be subject to limitation based upon ownership changes.\nWe have significant federal net operating loss carryforwards and state net operating loss carryforwards. While our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards are fully reserved for, if we are unable to maintain our recent profitability, we may not be able to fully utilize these tax benefits. Furthermore, generally a change of more than 50% in the ownership of a company\u2019s stock, by value, over a three-year period constitutes an ownership change for federal income tax purposes. An ownership change may limit a company\u2019s ability to use its net operating loss carry-forwards attributable to the period prior to such change. As a result, our ability to use our net operating loss carry-forwards attributable to the period prior to such ownership change to offset taxable income will be subject to limitations in a particular year, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability for us.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, our business and financial results could be harmed.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that we would prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial statements or fraud. As of March 31, 2020, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our internal controls were designed and operating effectively. There can be no assurance that we will not experience another material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and in a timely manner or to detect and prevent fraud, could result in a restatement of our financial statements, and could also cause a loss of investor confidence and decline in the market price of our common stock.\nWe expect our quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate. If we fail to meet the expectations of market analysts or investors, the market price of our common stock could decline substantially, and we could become subject to securities litigation.\nOur quarterly revenue and operating results have fluctuated in the past and will likely vary from quarter to quarter in the future. Our results for any particular quarter are not an indication of our future performance. Our revenue and operating results may fall\nbelow the expectations of market analysts or investors in some future quarter or quarters. Our failure to meet these expectations could cause the market price of our common stock to decline substantially. If the price of our common stock is volatile or falls significantly below our current price, we may be the target of securities litigation. If we become involved in this type of litigation, regardless of the outcome, we could incur substantial legal costs, management\u2019s attention could be diverted from the operation of our business, and our reputation could be damaged, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not continue to publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will continue to depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about our business or us. If these analysts do not continue to provide adequate research coverage or if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nThe market price of our common stock could be adversely affected by future sales of our common stock in the public market by us or our executive officers and directors.\nWe and our executive officers and directors may from time to time sell shares of our common stock in the public market or otherwise. We cannot predict the size or the effect, if any, that future sales of shares of our common stock by us or our executive officers and directors, or the perception of such sales, would have on the market price of our common stock.\nWe are not currently paying dividends and will likely not pay any dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never paid or declared any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. In addition, the terms of our existing revolving credit agreement restrict the payment of cash dividends on our common stock. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant. The restriction on and decision not to pay dividends may impact our ability to attract investors and raise funds, if necessary, in the capital markets.\nAnti-takeover provisions included in the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law, provisions in our amended and restated articles of incorporation or bylaws and the common share purchase rights that accompany shares of our common stock could delay or prevent a change of control of our company, which could adversely impact the value of our common stock and may prevent or frustrate attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current board of directors or management.\nA change of control of our company may be discouraged, delayed or prevented by certain provisions of the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law. These provisions generally restrict a broad range of business combinations between a Wisconsin corporation and a shareholder owning 15% or more of our outstanding common stock. These and other provisions in our amended and restated articles of incorporation, including our staggered board of directors and our ability to issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, as well as the provisions of our amended and restated bylaws and Wisconsin law, could make it more difficult for shareholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are opposed by the then-current board of directors, including to delay or impede a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving our company.\nEach currently outstanding share of our common stock includes, and each newly issued share of our common stock will include, a common share purchase right. The rights are attached to, and trade with, the shares of common stock and generally are not exercisable. The rights will become exercisable if a person or group acquires, or announces an intention to acquire, 20% or more of our outstanding common stock. The rights have some anti-takeover effects and generally will cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire control of us without conditioning the offer on either redemption of the rights or amendment of the rights to prevent this dilution. The rights could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control.\nIn addition, our employment arrangements with senior management provide for severance payments and accelerated vesting of benefits, including accelerated vesting of stock options and restricted stock awards, upon a change of control and a subsequent\nqualifying termination. These provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby adversely affecting the market price of our common stock. These provisions may also discourage or prevent a change of control or result in a lower price per share paid to our shareholders.", "PERMNO": 92466, "SIC": 3640, "TIC": "OESX"}
