Like other businesses operating in the securities industry, our business is directly affected by volatile trading markets, fluctuations in the volume of market activity, economic and political conditions, upward and downward trends in business and finance at large, legislation and regulation affecting the national and international business and financial communities, currency values, inflation, market conditions, the availability and cost of short-term or long-term funding and capital, the credit capacity or perceived credit-worthiness of the securities industry in the marketplace and the level and volatility of interest rates. We also face risks relating to trading losses, losses resulting from the ownership or underwriting of securities, counterparty failure to meet commitments, customer fraud, employee fraud, issuer fraud, errors and misconduct, failures in connection with the processing of securities transactions and litigation. A reduction in our revenues or a loss resulting from our underwriting or ownership of securities or sales or trading of securities could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, as a result of these risks, our revenues and operating results may be subject to significant fluctuations from quarter to quarter and from year to year.\nLower price levels in the securities markets may reduce our profitability.\nLower price levels of securities may result in (i) reduced volumes of securities, options and futures transactions, with a consequent reduction in our commission revenues, and (ii) losses from declines in the market value of securities we held in investment and underwriting positions. In periods of low volume, our levels of profitability are further adversely affected because certain of our expenses remain relatively fixed. Sudden sharp declines in market values of securities and the failure of issuers and counterparties to perform their obligations can result in illiquid markets which, in turn, may result in our having difficulty selling securities. Such negative market conditions, if prolonged, may also lower our revenues from investment banking and other activities. A reduction in our revenues from investment banking or other activities could have a material adverse affect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThere is intense competition in the brokerage industry.\nSiebert encounters significant competition from full-commission, online and other discount brokerage firms, as well as from financial institutions, mutual fund sponsors and other organizations many of which are significantly larger and better capitalized than Siebert. SBS also encounters significant competition from firms engaged in the municipal finance business. Over the past several years, price wars and lower commission rates in the discount brokerage business in general have strengthened our competitors. Siebert believes that such changes in the industry will continue to strengthen existing competitors and attract additional competitors such as banks, insurance companies, providers of online financial and information services, and others. Many of these competitors are larger, more diversified, have greater capital resources, and offer a wider range of services and financial products than Siebert. Siebert competes with a wide variety of vendors of financial services for the same customers. Siebert may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors.\nSome competitors in the discount brokerage business offer services which we may not. In addition, some competitors have continued to offer lower flat rate execution fees that are difficult for any conventional discount firm to meet. Industry-wide changes in trading practices are expected to cause continuing pressure on fees earned by discount brokers for the sale of order flow. Many of the flat fee brokers impose charges for services such as mailing, transfers and handling exchanges which Siebert does not and also direct their execution to captive market makers. Continued or increased competition from ultra low cost, flat fee brokers and broader service offerings from other discount brokers could limit our growth or lead to a decline in Siebert\u2019s customer base which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation.\nOur business is subject to extensive regulation in the United States, at both the Federal and state level. We are also subject to regulation by self-regulatory organizations and other regulatory bodies in the United States, such as the SEC, the NYSE, FINRA and the MSRB. We are registered as a broker-dealer in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. The regulations to which we are subject as a broker-dealer cover all aspects of the securities business including: training of personnel, sales methods, trading practices, uses and safe keeping of customers\u2019 funds and securities, capital structure, record keeping, fee arrangements, disclosure and the conduct of directors, officers and employees. Failure to comply with any of these laws, rules or regulations, which may be subject to the uncertainties of interpretation, could result in civil penalties, fines, suspension or expulsion and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n- 8 -\nThe laws, rules and regulations, as well as governmental policies and accounting principles, governing our business and the financial services and banking industries generally have changed significantly over recent years and are expected to continue to do so. We cannot predict which changes in laws, rules, regulations, governmental policies or accounting principles will be adopted. Any changes in the laws, rules, regulations, governmental policies or accounting principles relating to our business could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to net capital requirements.\nThe SEC, FINRA, and various other securities and commodities exchanges and other regulatory bodies in the United States have rules with respect to net capital requirements which affect us. These rules have the effect of requiring that at least a substantial portion of a broker-dealer\u2019s assets be kept in cash or highly liquid investments. Our compliance with the net capital requirements could limit operations that require intensive use of capital, such as underwriting or trading activities. These rules could also restrict our ability to withdraw our capital, even in circumstances where we have more than the minimum amount of required capital, which, in turn, could limit our ability to implement growth strategies. In addition, a change in such rules, or the imposition of new rules, affecting the scope, coverage, calculation or amount of such net capital requirements, or a significant operating loss or any unusually large charge against net capital, could have similar adverse effects.\nOur customers may fail to pay us.\nA principal credit risk to which we are exposed on a regular basis is that our customers may fail to pay for their purchases or fail to maintain the minimum required collateral for amounts borrowed against securities positions maintained by them. We cannot assure you that the policies and procedures we have established will be adequate to prevent a significant credit loss.\nWe face risks relating to our investment banking activities.\nCertain risks are involved in the underwriting of securities. Investment banking and underwriting syndicates agree to purchase securities at a discount from the public offering price. If the securities must be sold below the syndicate cost, an underwriter is exposed to losses on the securities that it has committed to purchase. In the last several years, investment banking firms increasingly have underwritten corporate and municipal offerings with fewer syndicate participants or, in some cases, without an underwriting syndicate. In these cases, the underwriter assumes a larger part or all of the risk of an underwriting transaction.\nUnder Federal securities laws, other laws and court decisions, an underwriter is exposed to substantial potential liability for material misstatements or omissions of fact in the prospectus used to describe the securities being offered. While municipal securities are exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, underwriters of municipal securities are exposed to substantial potential liability for material misstatements or omissions of fact in the offering documents prepared for these offerings.\nAn increase in volume on our systems or other events could cause them to malfunction.\nDuring 2014, we received and processed up to approximately 67% of our trade orders electronically. This method of trading is heavily dependent on the integrity of the electronic systems supporting it. While we have never experienced a significant failure of our trading systems, heavy stress placed on our systems during peak trading times could cause our systems to operate at unacceptably low speeds or fail altogether. Any significant degradation or failure of our systems or the systems of third parties involved in the trading process (e.g., online and Internet service providers, record keeping and data processing functions performed by third parties, and third party software), even for a short time, could cause customers to suffer delays in trading. These delays could cause substantial losses for customers and could subject us to claims from these customers for losses. There can be no assurance that our network structure will operate appropriately in the event of a subsystem, component or software failure. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will be able to prevent an extended systems failure in the event of a power or telecommunications failure, an earthquake, terrorist attack, fire or any act of God. Any systems failure that causes interruptions in our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe rely on information processing and communications systems to process and record our transactions.\nOur operations rely heavily on information processing and communications systems. Our system for processing securities transactions is highly automated. Failure of our information processing or communications systems for a significant period of time could limit our ability to process a large volume of transactions accurately and rapidly. This could cause us to be unable to satisfy our obligations to customers and other securities firms, and could result in regulatory violations. External events, such as an earthquake, terrorist attack or power failure, loss of external information feeds, such as security price information, as well as internal malfunctions such as those that could occur during the implementation of system modifications, could render part or all of these systems inoperative.\n- 9 -\nWe may not be able to keep up pace with continuing changes in technology.\nOur market is characterized by rapidly changing technology. To be successful, we must adapt to this rapidly changing environment by continually improving the performance, features and reliability of our services. We could incur substantial costs if we need to modify our services or infrastructure or adapt our technology to respond to these changes. A delay or failure to address technological advances and developments or an increase in costs resulting from these changes could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on our ability to attract and retain key personnel.\nOur continued success was principally dependent on our founder, Muriel F. Siebert, our former Chairwoman, Chief Executive Officer and President, and our senior management. In addition, the continued success of SBSF may be dependent on the services of Napoleon Brandford III and Suzanne Shank. The loss of the services of any of these individuals could significantly harm our business, financial condition and operating results. However the appointment of Suzanne Shank as Acting Chief Executive Officer and Joseph Ramos as Chief Operating Officer has stabilized the Company as a result of our loss of Ms. Siebert. On March 3, 2015 Suzanne Shank completed her role as acting Chief Executive Officer of our Company to devote full time to her continuing position as Chief Executive Officer of SBSF.\nOur principal shareholder may control many key decisions.\nThe estate of Ms. Muriel F. Siebert currently owns approximately 90% of our outstanding common stock. The executors of the estate, Jane Macon and Patricia Francy, who are both directors of the Company, have the power to elect the entire Board of Directors and, except as otherwise provided by law or our Certificate of Incorporation or by-laws, to approve any action requiring shareholder approval without a shareholders meeting.\nThere may be no public market for our common stock.\nOnly approximately 2,200,000 shares, or approximately 10% of our shares outstanding, are currently held by the public. Although our common stock is traded in The NASDAQ Capital Market, there can be no assurance that an active public market will continue.", "PERMNO": 53373, "SIC": 6211, "TIC": "SIEB"}
