{"cik": "354963", "company": "SHENANDOAH TELECOMMUNICATIONS CO/VA/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-23", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nOur business and operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. The risks set forth under \"Business-Competition\" and the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business. The following risks (or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial) could materially affect our financial results and conditions.\nRisks Related to the Telecommunications Industry\nIntensifying competition in all segments of our business may limit our ability to sustain profitable operations.\nAs new technologies are developed and deployed by competitors in our service area, some of our subscribers may select other providers\u2019 offerings based on price, capabilities or personal preferences. Most of our competitors possess greater resources, have more extensive coverage areas and offer more services than we do. If significant numbers of our subscribers elect to move to competing providers, or if market saturation limits the rate of new subscriber additions, we may not be able to sustain profitable operations.\nNationwide, incumbent local exchange carriers have experienced a decrease in access lines due to the effect of wireless and wireline competition. We have experienced reductions in the number of access lines to date, but based on industry experience we anticipate that the long-term trend toward declining telephone subscriber counts will continue. There is a significant risk that this downward trend will have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s landline telephone operations in the future.\nThe Company\u2019s revenue from fiber leases may be adversely impacted by price competition for these facilities.\nAlternative technologies, changes in the regulatory environment and current uncertainties in the marketplace may reduce future demand for existing telecommunication services.\nThe telecommunications industry is experiencing significant technological change, evolving industry standards, ongoing improvements in the capacity and quality of digital technology, shorter development cycles for new products and enhancements and changes in end-user requirements and preferences. Technological advances, industry changes, changes in the regulatory environment and the availability of additional spectrum or additional flexibility with respect to the use of currently available spectrum could cause the technology we use to become obsolete. We and our vendors may not be able to respond to such changes and implement new technology on a timely basis, or at an acceptable cost.\nAdverse economic conditions in the United States and in our market area involving significantly reduced consumer spending could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nOur customers are individual consumers and businesses. Any national economic weakness, restricted credit markets or high unemployment rates could depress consumer spending and harm our operating performance. In addition, our customers are located in a relatively concentrated geographic area; therefore, any adverse economic conditions that affect our geographic markets in particular could have a disproportionately negative impact on our results.\nRegulation by government and taxing agencies may increase our costs of providing service or require changes in services, either of which could impair our financial performance.\nOur operations are subject to varying degrees of regulation by the FCC, the Federal Trade Commission, the FAA, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, as well as by state and local regulatory agencies and franchising authorities. Action by these regulatory bodies could negatively affect our operations and our costs of doing business. For example, changes in tax laws or the interpretation of existing tax laws by state and local authorities could increase income, sales, property or other tax costs.\nOur access revenue may be adversely impacted by legislative or regulatory actions or by technology developments that decrease access rates or exempt certain traffic from paying for access to our regulated telephone network.\nOn October 27, 2011, the FCC adopted a number of broad changes to the intercarrier compensation rules governing the interstate access rates charged by small-to-mid-sized ILECs such as Shenandoah Telephone. For example, the\nFCC adopted a national \u201cbill and keep\u201d framework, which may result in substantial reductions in the access charges paid by long distance carriers and other interconnecting carriers, possibly to zero, accompanied by increases to the subscriber line charges paid by business and residential end users. In addition, the FCC has changed some of the rules that determine what compensation carriers, including but not limited to wireless carriers, competitive local exchange carriers, VoIP providers and providers of other Internet-enabled services, should pay (and receive) for their traffic that is interconnected with ILEC networks. These changes, and potential future changes, to such compensation regulations could increase our expenses or reduce our revenues. In addition, the Company is working to resolve several routine interconnection and intercarrier compensation-related disputes concerning the appropriate access rates and terms for the origination and termination of traffic on third-party networks.\nThe VSCC has jurisdiction over local telephone companies\u2019 intrastate access charges. The VSCC issued a Final Order on August 9, 2011 that requires elimination of common carrier line charges in three stages. Pursuant to this order, the Company\u2019s intrastate common line revenue declined in 2011, 2012 and 2013 and was ultimately eliminated in mid-2014.\nOur distribution networks may be subject to weather-related events that may damage our networks and adversely impact our ability to deliver promised services or increase costs related to such events.\nOur distribution networks may be subject to weather-related events that could damage our networks and impact service delivery. Some published reports predict that warming global temperatures will increase the frequency and severity of such weather-related events. Should such predictions be correct or for other reasons there are more weather-related events, and should such events impact the Mid-Atlantic region covered by our networks more frequently than in the past, our revenues and expenses could be materially adversely impacted.\nRisks Related to our Overall Business Strategy\nWe may not benefit from our acquisition strategy.\nAs part of our business strategy, we regularly evaluate opportunities to enhance the value of the Company by pursuing acquisitions of other businesses. Although we remain subject to financial and other covenants in our credit agreement that may limit our ability to pursue certain strategic opportunities, we intend to continue to evaluate and, when appropriate, pursue strategic acquisition opportunities as they arise. We cannot provide any assurance, however, with respect to the timing, likelihood, size or financial effect of any potential transaction involving the Company, as we may not be successful in identifying and consummating any acquisition or in integrating any newly acquired business into our operations.\nThe evaluation of business acquisition opportunities and the integration of any acquired businesses pose a number of significant risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nacquisitions may place significant strain on our management, financial and other resources by requiring us to expend a substantial amount of time and resources in the pursuit of acquisitions that we may not complete, or to devote significant attention to the various integration efforts of any newly acquired businesses, all of which will require the allocation of limited resources;\n\u2022\nacquisitions may not have a positive impact on our cash flows or financial performance;\n\u2022\neven if acquired companies eventually contribute to an increase in our cash flows or profitability, such acquisitions may adversely affect our operating results in the short term as a result of transaction-related expenses we will have to pay or the higher operating and administrative expenses we may incur in the periods immediately following an acquisition as we seek to integrate the acquired business into our operations;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to realize anticipated synergies or eliminate as many redundant costs as we anticipate;\n\u2022\nour operating and financial systems and controls and information services may not be compatible with those of the companies we may acquire and may not be adequate to support our integration efforts, and any steps we take to improve these systems and controls may not be sufficient;\n\u2022\nour business plans and projections used to justify the acquisitions and expansion investments are based on assumptions of revenues per subscriber, penetration rates in specific markets where we operate and expected operating costs. These assumptions may not develop as projected, which may negatively impact our profitability or the value of our intangible assets;\n\u2022\ngrowth through acquisitions will increase our need for qualified personnel, who may not be available to us or, if they were employed by a business we acquire, remain with us after the acquisition; and\n\u2022\nacquired businesses may have unexpected liabilities and contingencies, which could be significant.\nOur ability to comply with the financial covenants in our credit agreement depends primarily on our ability to generate sufficient operating cash flow.\nOur ability to comply with the financial covenants under the agreement governing our secured credit facilities will depend primarily on our success in generating sufficient operating cash flow. Under our credit agreement, we are subject to a total leverage ratio covenant, a minimum debt service coverage ratio covenant and a minimum liquidity test. Industry conditions and financial, business and other factors, including those we identify as risk factors in this and our other reports, will affect our ability to generate the cash flows we need to satisfy those financial tests and ratios. Our failure to satisfy the tests or ratios could result in a default and acceleration of repayment of the indebtedness under our credit facilities. If the maturity of our indebtedness were accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds to repay such indebtedness. In such event, to the extent permitted by our credit agreement and applicable law, our lenders would be entitled to proceed against the collateral securing the indebtedness, which includes substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries.\nOur level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and ability to compete.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $847.9 million of total long-term indebtedness. Our level of indebtedness could have important adverse consequences. For example, it may:\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including interest rate increases, because as of December 31, 2016, a significant portion of our borrowings were, and may continue to be, subject to variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds to alleviate liquidity constraints, as a result of financial and other restrictive covenants in our credit agreement;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies that have less indebtedness.\nIn addition, our secured credit facilities impose operating and financial restrictions that limit our discretion on some business matters, which could make it more difficult for us to expand, finance our operations and engage in other business activities that may be in our interest. These restrictions limit our ability and that of our subsidiaries to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness and additional liens on our assets;\n\u2022\nengage in certain mergers or acquisitions or asset dispositions;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make other distributions;\n\u2022\nvoluntarily prepay other indebtedness;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliated persons;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments; and\n\u2022\nchange the nature of our business.\nIn addition to the term loan secured indebtedness we have incurred and the $75 million of revolving credit indebtedness we may incur from time to time, we may incur additional indebtedness under our credit facilities. Any additional indebtedness we may incur in the future may subject us to similar or even more restrictive conditions.\nOur ability to refinance our indebtedness in the future, should circumstances require it, will depend on our ability in the future to generate cash flows from operations and to raise additional funds, including through the offering of equity or debt securities and through our access to bank debt markets. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations or to raise additional funds in amounts necessary for us to repay our indebtedness when such indebtedness becomes due and to meet our other cash needs.\nDisruptions of our information technology infrastructure could harm our business.\nWe depend on our information technology infrastructure to achieve our business objectives. A disruption of our infrastructure could be caused by a natural disaster, manufacturing failure, telecommunications system failure, cybersecurity attack, intrusion or incident, or defective or improperly installed new or upgraded business management systems. Portions of our IT infrastructure also may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time. In the event of any such disruption, we may be unable to conduct our business in the normal course. Moreover, our business involves the processing, storage and transmission of data, which would also be negatively affected by such an event. A disruption of our infrastructure could cause us to lose customers and revenue, particularly during a period of heavy demand for our services. We also could incur significant expense in repairing system damage and taking other remedial measures.\nWe could suffer a loss of revenue and increased costs, exposure to significant liability, reputational harm and other serious negative consequences if we sustain cyber-attacks or other data security breaches that disrupt our operations or result in the dissemination of proprietary or confidential information about us or our customers or other third parties.\nWe utilize our information technology infrastructure to manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our operations. We routinely process, store and transmit large amounts of data for our customers, including sensitive and personally identifiable information. We depend on our information technology infrastructure to conduct business operations and provide customer services. We may be subject to data breaches and disruptions of the information technology systems we use for these purposes. Our industry has witnessed an increase in the number, intensity and sophistication of cybersecurity incidents caused by hackers and other malicious actors such as foreign governments, criminals, hacktivists, terrorists and insider threats. Hackers and other malicious actors may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential, sensitive, personal or proprietary information, or that of third parties, and engage in the unauthorized use or dissemination of such information. They may be able to create system disruptions, or cause shutdowns. Hackers and other malicious actors may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, ransomware and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our systems. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including \u201cbugs,\u201d cybersecurity vulnerabilities and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation or security of our systems.\nThe consequences of a breach of our security measures, a cyber-related service or operational disruption, or a breach of personal, confidential, proprietary or sensitive data caused by a hacker or other malicious actor could be significant for us, our customers and other affected third parties. For example, the consequences could include damage to infrastructure and property, impairment of business operations, disruptions to customer service, financial costs and harm to our liquidity, costs associated with remediation, loss of revenues, loss of customers, competitive disadvantage, legal expenses associated with litigation, regulatory action, fines or penalties or damage to our brand and reputation.\nIn addition, the costs to us to eliminate or address the foregoing security challenges and vulnerabilities before or after a cyber incident could be significant. In addition, our remediation efforts may not be successful and could\nresult in interruptions, delays or cessation of service. We could also lose existing or potential customers for our services in connection with any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in the services.\nWe are subject to laws, rules and regulations relating to the collection, use and security of user data. Our operations are also subject to federal and state laws governing information security. In the event of a data breach or operational disruption caused by an information security incident, such rules may require consumer and government agency notification and may result in regulatory enforcement actions with the potential of monetary forfeitures as well as civil litigation. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, expenses to comply with privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards and contractual obligations.\nOur balance sheet contains certain intangible assets including goodwill that we may be required to write off or write down in the future in the event of the impairment of certain of those assets arising from any deterioration in our future performance or other circumstances. Such write-offs or write-downs could adversely impact our earnings and stock price, and our ability to obtain financing in the future.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had $145.3 million in goodwill capitalized on our balance sheet and $454.5 million of other intangible assets capitalized on our balance sheet, which collectively represented 40.4% of our total assets at that date.\nWe test our goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually or when events or circumstances warrant. If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record an impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the intangible asset and the fair value of the intangible asset, in the period in which the determination is made.\nWe may be required in the future to write off or write down certain intangible assets including goodwill in the event of deterioration in our future performance, sustained slower growth or other circumstances. Such a write off or write down could adversely impact our earnings and stock price, and our ability to obtain financing in the future.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that, if not properly corrected, could materially adversely affect our operations and result in material misstatements in our financial statements.\nAs described in \"Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\", we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of December 31, 2016 because material weaknesses existed in our internal control over financial reporting related to the inadequate design and documentation of management review controls over the accounting for significant, complex and unusual transactions, accounting for income taxes, and the preparation of the consolidated statements of cash flows. For 2016, such transactions included the acquisition of nTelos and asset exchange transaction with Sprint that closed on May 6, 2016. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nThe Company is in the process of identifying and implementing certain changes in our internal controls to address the material weaknesses. Specifically, the Company is documenting, implementing, and assessing necessary changes in the risk assessment process and in the design of the controls, and identifying additional controls and additional resources required to ensure effective management and technical review and documentation. Although the Company is taking the foregoing actions to remediate the material weakness and believe, based on our evaluation to date, that the material weakness will be remediated during 2017, we cannot assure you that this will occur within the contemplated timeframe. Moreover, we cannot assure you that we will not identify additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. If we are unable to remediate the material weakness, our ability to record, process and report financial information accurately, and to prepare financial statements within the time periods specified by the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, could be adversely affected. The occurrence of or failure to remediate the material weakness may adversely affect our reputation and business and the market price of our common stock and any other securities we may issue.\nWe have an underfunded non-contributory defined benefit pension plan.\nThrough our acquisition of nTelos, we assumed nTelos\u2019 non-contributory defined benefit pension plan covering all employees who met eligibility requirements and were employed by nTelos prior to October 1, 2003. This pension\nplan was closed to nTelos employees hired on or after October 1, 2003. As of December 31, 2016, the plan was underfunded under U.S. GAAP measures by $10.3 million. See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the accounting for the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. We do not expect that we will be required to make a cash contribution to the underfunded pension plan in 2017, but we may be required to make cash contributions in future periods depending on the level of interest rates and investment returns on plan assets.\nIncreases in our costs of providing benefits under our non-contributory defined benefit pension plan and other postretirement benefit plans could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nThe measurement of the plan obligations and costs of providing benefits under our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans involves various factors, including the development of valuation assumptions and accounting policy elections. We are required to make assumptions and estimates that include the discount rate applied to benefit obligations, the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets, the anticipated rate of increase of health care costs, our expected level of contributions to the plans, the incidence of mortality, the expected remaining service period of plan participants, the level of compensation and rate of compensation increases, employee age, length of service, and the long-term expected investment rate credited to employees of certain plans, among other factors. See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the accounting for the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. If our benefit plans' costs increase, due to adverse changes in the U.S. securities markets, resulting in worse-than-assumed investment returns and discount rates, and adverse medical cost trends, our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to the Recently Completed nTelos Acquisition and the Sprint Transactions\nIn connection with the nTelos acquisition, we incurred significant additional indebtedness, which could materially and adversely affect us, including by decreasing our business flexibility.\nWe have substantially increased indebtedness following completion of the nTelos acquisition in comparison to that of the Company on a recent historical basis, which has increased our interest expense and amortization requirements and could have the effect, among other things, of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions. The amount of cash required to pay interest on our increased indebtedness and the increased amortization requirements to pay down the loan balances following the nTelos acquisition, and thus the demands on our cash resources, could be greater than the amount of cash flows required to service our indebtedness prior to the nTelos acquisition. Our increased levels of indebtedness could also reduce funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends and other general corporate purposes and may create competitive disadvantages for us relative to other companies with lower debt levels. If we do not achieve the expected benefits and cost savings from the nTelos acquisition, or if the financial performance of the combined company does not meet current expectations, then our ability to service this indebtedness may be materially and adversely impacted.\nIt may be difficult to successfully integrate the business of nTelos and we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits from the nTelos acquisition, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and the market price of our common stock.\nIf we experience greater than anticipated costs to integrate nTelos into our existing operations our business and results of operations could be materially and negatively affected. In addition, it is possible that the ongoing integration process could result in the disruption of our ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the nTelos acquisition. Integration efforts also may divert management attention and resources.\nThe success of the nTelos acquisition will also depend, in significant part, on our ability to successfully integrate the acquired business, retain and migrate nTelos\u2019s customers and realize the synergies anticipated with the nTelos acquisition. Many of these synergies are not expected to occur for a period of time and will require capital expenditures to be fully realized. If we are unable to integrate nTelos successfully, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the nTelos acquisition, including the anticipated synergies.\nRisks Related to the Wireless Industry\nNew disclosure or usage requirements could adversely affect the results of our wireless operations.\nThe FCC is considering imposing additional consumer protection requirements upon wireless service providers, including billing-related disclosures and usage alerts. Such requirements could increase costs related to or impact the amount of revenue we receive from our wireless services.\nCustomer concerns over radio frequency emissions may discourage use of wireless handsets or expose us to potential litigation.\nIn the past, media reports and certain professional studies have suggested that certain radio frequency emissions from wireless handsets may be linked to various health problems, including cancer, and may interfere with various electronic medical devices, including hearing aids and pacemakers. Additionally, the FCC has commenced a rulemaking and notice of inquiry that seeks public comment on a variety of issues, including whether revisions to the existing radio frequency standards and testing requirements are warranted. Any decrease in demand for wireless services, increases in the costs of litigation or damage awards resulting from substantiation of harm from such emissions could impair our financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulation by governmental authorities or potential litigation relating to the use of wireless handsets while driving could adversely affect the results of our wireless operations.\nSome studies have indicated that some aspects of using wireless handsets while driving may impair driver's attention in certain circumstances, making accidents more likely. These concerns could lead to litigation relating to accidents, deaths or serious bodily injuries, or to new restrictions or regulations on wireless phone use. A number of state and local governments are considering or have enacted legislation that would restrict or prohibit the use of a wireless handset while driving a vehicle or, alternatively, require the use of a hands-free handset. Additionally, certain federal agencies have adopted rules and proposed guidelines for the use of wireless handsets while operating commercial and non-commercial vehicles. These rules, and any legislation that could be enacted, may require wireless service providers to supply to their subscribers hands-free enhanced services, such as voice-activated dialing and hands-free speaker phones and headsets, in order to continue generating revenue from subscribers, who make many of their calls while on the road. If we are unable to provide hands-free services and products to subscribers in a timely and adequate fashion, the volume of wireless phone usage would likely decrease, and the ability of our wireless operations to generate revenues would suffer.\nRisks Related to our Wireless Services\nThe performance of our wireless service provider Shenandoah Personal Communications, LLC, our largest operating subsidiary in terms of revenues and assets, may be adversely affected by any interruption in, or other adverse change to, Sprint\u2019s business.\nWe rely significantly on Sprint\u2019s ongoing operations to continue to offer our wireless subscribers the seamless national services that we currently provide. Any interruption in, or other adverse change to, Sprint\u2019s business could adversely affect our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Our business could also be adversely affected if competing national or regional wireless carriers are able to introduce new products and services or otherwise satisfy customers\u2019 service demands more rapidly or more effectively than Sprint.\nThe costs associated with our ongoing participation in Sprint\u2019s network modernization plan may affect our operating results, liquidity and financial position.\nSprint continues to modernize its wireless network with the intention of improving voice quality, coverage and data speeds and simultaneously reducing future operating costs. We participate in this plan and, to date, we have made significant upgrades in our service areas, but ongoing modernization efforts are expected to continue.\nThe continuing success of Sprint\u2019s modernization plans will depend on the timing, extent and cost of implementation and the performance of third parties. Should Sprint\u2019s implementation plan be delayed, our margins could be adversely affected and such effects could be material. Should Sprint\u2019s future delivery of services expected to be deployed on the upgraded network be delayed, it could potentially result in the loss of customers to our competitors and adversely affect our revenues, profitability and cash flows from operations.\nOur business may suffer as a result of competitive pressures.\nOur revenue growth is primarily dependent on the growth of our subscriber base and monthly recurring charges to subscribers. Since 2014, competitive pressures in the wireless services industry have increased. These competitive pressures in the wireless telecommunications market could cause some major carriers to offer plans with increasingly larger bundles of minutes of use and data services or unlimited plans at lower prices. Increased price competition will lead to lower monthly recurring charges or a loss of subscribers in the future. Continued competitive pressures could require Sprint to lower its prices, which will limit growth in monthly recurring charges to subscribers and could adversely affect our revenues, profitability and cash flows from operations.\nWe may not be able to implement our business plan successfully if our operating costs are higher than we anticipate.\nIncreased competition may lead to higher promotional costs to acquire subscribers. If these costs are more than we anticipate, the actual amount of funds available to implement our operating strategy and business plan may fall short of our estimates.\nThe dynamic nature of the wireless market may limit management\u2019s ability to correctly identify causes of volatility in key operating performance measures.\nOur business plan and estimated future operating results are based on estimates of key operating performance measures, including subscriber growth, subscriber turnover (commonly known as churn), average monthly revenue per subscriber, equipment revenue, subscriber acquisition costs and other operating costs. Continued moves by all carriers to offer installment billing and leasing for wireless handsets will have an effect on revenues, cost of goods sold and churn. The dynamic nature of the wireless market, economic conditions, increased competition in the wireless telecommunications industry, the entry of new competitors due to recent or future FCC spectrum auctions, new service offerings by Sprint or competitors at lower prices and other issues facing the wireless telecommunications industry in general have created a level of uncertainty that may adversely affect our ability to predict these key measures of performance.\nWe may experience a high rate of subscriber turnover, which could adversely affect our future financial performance.\nSubscriber loss, or churn, has been relatively stable in recent years. Because of significant competition in the industry, the popularity of prepaid wireless service offerings, changes to Sprint\u2019s competitive position and economic uncertainty, among other factors, this relative stability may not continue and the future rate of subscriber turnover may be higher than in recent periods.\nA high rate of subscriber loss could increase the sales and marketing costs we incur in obtaining new subscribers, especially because, consistent with industry practice, even with the introduction of wireless handset installment billing and leasing, we expect to continue to subsidize a portion of the costs related to the purchases of wireless handsets by some subscribers.\nWe may incur significantly higher wireless handset subsidy costs than we anticipate for existing subscribers who upgrade to a new wireless handset.\nAs our subscriber base matures, and technological innovations occur, we anticipate that existing subscribers will continue to upgrade to new wireless handsets. To discourage customer defections to competitors, we offer price plans that subsidize a portion of the price of wireless handsets and, in some cases, incur sales commissions for wireless handset upgrades. If more subscribers upgrade to new subsidized wireless handsets than we project, or if the cost of such wireless handsets increases or the amount of wireless handset subsidies offered in the competitive marketplace increases more than we project, our results of operations will be adversely affected. If we do not continue to offer the option to subsidize the cost of wireless handsets for upgrades, subscribers could choose to deactivate the service and move to our competitors.\nIf we are unable to secure and retain tower sites, the level of service we provide could be adversely affected.\nMany of our cell sites are co-located on leased tower facilities shared with one or more wireless providers. A large portion of these leased tower sites are owned by a limited number of companies. If economic conditions adversely affect the leasing company, then our ability to enter into leases at new locations may be affected, which could leave portions of our service area without service and increase customer turnover or adversely affect our ability to expand into new geographic areas.\nMost of the towers that we own are located on leased real property. If such leases are not renewed, we may have to relocate those cell sites, which would create significant additional expenses, or leave portions of our service area without service, increasing the likelihood of customer turnover.\nRisks Related to Our Relationship with Sprint\nSprint may make business decisions that are not in our best interests, which may adversely affect our business and our relationships with subscribers in our territory, increase our expenses and decrease our revenues.\nUnder its agreements with us, Sprint has a substantial amount of control over the conduct of our wireless business. Accordingly, Sprint may make decisions that could adversely affect our wireless business, such as the following:\n\u2022\nSprint could price its national plans based on its own objectives and could set price levels or other terms that may not be economically advantageous for us;\n\u2022\nSprint could develop products and services that could adversely affect our results of operations;\n\u2022\nif Sprint\u2019s costs to perform certain services exceed the costs they expect, subject to limitations under our agreements, Sprint could seek to increase the amounts charged to us for such services;\n\u2022\nSprint could make decisions that could adversely affect the Sprint brand names, reputation, or products or services, which could adversely affect our business;\n\u2022\nSprint could make technology and network decisions that could greatly increase our capital investment requirements and our operating costs to continue offering the seamless national service we provide; and\n\u2022\nSprint could restrict our ability to offer new services needed to remain competitive. This could put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other wireless service providers if those other wireless service providers begin offering those new services in our market areas, increasing our churn, adversely affecting our ability to obtain new subscribers and reducing our revenues and operating income from wireless services.\nOur dependence on Sprint for services may limit our ability to forecast operating results.\nOur dependence on Sprint injects a degree of uncertainty into our business and financial planning. We may, at times, disagree with Sprint concerning the applicability, calculation approach, or accuracy of Sprint-supplied revenue data. It is our practice to reflect the information supplied by Sprint in our financial statements for the applicable periods and to make corrections, if any, no earlier than the period in which Sprint and we agree to the corrections.\nInaccuracies in data provided by Sprint could overstate or understate our expenses or revenues and result in out-of-period adjustments that may adversely affect our financial results.\nBecause Sprint provides billing and collection services for us, Sprint remits a significant portion of our total revenues. We rely on Sprint to provide accurate, timely and sufficient data and information to enable us to properly record revenues, expenses and accounts receivable which underlie a substantial portion of our financial statements and other financial disclosures. We and Sprint could discover errors or inaccuracies, which, even if not material to Sprint, could be material to us. If we are required in the future to make adjustments or incur charges as a result of errors or inaccuracies in data provided by Sprint, such adjustments or charges could materially affect our financial results for the period with respect to which the adjustments are made or charges are incurred. Such adjustments or charges could require restatement of our financial statements.\nWe are subject to risks relating to Sprint\u2019s provision of back office services and to changes in Sprint's products, services, plans and programs.\nAny failure by Sprint to provide high-quality back office services could lead to subscriber dissatisfaction, increased churn or otherwise increased costs or loss of revenue. We rely on Sprint\u2019s internal support systems, including customer care, billing and back office support. Our operations could be disrupted if Sprint is unable to provide or expand its internal support systems while maintaining acceptable service levels, or to efficiently outsource those services and systems through third-party vendors.\nIn addition, restrictions exist, and new restrictions are considered from time to time by Congress, federal agencies and states, on the extent to which wireless customers may receive unsolicited telemarketing calls, text messages, junk e-mail or spam. Our reliance on Sprint to perform those functions could subject us to potential liabilities. For example, an FCC enforcement action in 2015 resulted in a significant fine assessed upon Sprint following investigations that revealed that Sprint had improperly billed customers millions of dollars in unauthorized third-party premium text messaging services.\nThe competitiveness of Sprint\u2019s wireless products and services is a key factor in our ability to attract and retain subscribers. Changes in Sprint\u2019s wireless products and services may reduce subscriber additions, increase subscriber churn and decrease subscriber credit quality.\nSprint\u2019s roaming arrangements to provide service outside of the Sprint National Network may not be competitive with other wireless service providers, which may restrict our ability to attract and retain subscribers and may increase our costs of doing business.\nWe rely on Sprint\u2019s roaming arrangements with other wireless service providers for coverage in areas where Sprint wireless service is not available. If customers are not able to roam quickly or efficiently onto other wireless networks, we may lose current subscribers and Sprint wireless services may be less attractive to new subscribers.\nThe risks related to our roaming arrangements include the following:\n\u2022\nthe quality of the service provided by another provider while roaming may not approximate the quality of the service provided by the Sprint wireless network;\n\u2022\nthe price of a roaming call off network may not be competitive with prices of other wireless companies for roaming calls, or may not be \u201ccommercially reasonable\u201d (as determined by the FCC);\n\u2022\ncustomers may not be able to use Sprint\u2019s advanced features, such as voicemail notification, while roaming; and\n\u2022\nSprint or the carriers providing the service may not be able to provide accurate billing information on a timely basis.\nSome provisions of the Sprint agreements may diminish the value of our common stock and restrict or diminish the value of our business.\nUnder limited circumstances involving non-renewal of our agreement or a breach by us, Sprint may purchase the operating assets of our wireless operations at a discount of 10% in the event of non-renewal, or 19% in the event of a breach. These discounts would be applied to the \u201centire business value\u201d (\u201cEBV\u201d) as that term is defined in our agreement with Sprint. EBV is defined as (i) the fair market value of a going concern paid by a willing buyer to a willing seller in a change of control transaction; (ii) valued as if the business will continue to utilize existing brands and operate under existing agreements; and, (iii) valued as if we have continued use of the spectrum then in use in the network. Determination of EBV is made by an independent appraisal process. In addition, Sprint must approve any assignment of the Sprint agreements by us. Sprint also has a right of first refusal to purchase our wireless operating assets if we decide to sell those assets to a third party. These restrictions and other restrictions contained in the Sprint agreements could adversely affect the value of our common stock, may limit our ability to sell our wireless operating assets on advantageous terms, may reduce the value a buyer would be willing to pay to acquire those assets and may reduce the EBV, as described in the Sprint agreements.\nWe may have difficulty in obtaining an adequate supply of wireless handsets from Sprint.\nWe depend on our relationship with Sprint to obtain wireless handsets. Sprint orders wireless handsets from various manufacturers. We could have difficulty obtaining specific types of wireless handsets in a timely manner if:\n\u2022\nSprint does not adequately project the need for wireless handsets, or enter into arrangements for new types of wireless handsets or other customer equipment, for itself, its wireless affiliates and its other third-party distribution channels, particularly in connection with the transition to new technologies;\n\u2022\nSprint gives preference to other distribution channels;\n\u2022\nwe do not adequately project our need for wireless handsets;\n\u2022\nSprint modifies its wireless handset logistics and delivery plan in a manner that restricts or delays access to wireless handsets; or\n\u2022\nthere is an adverse development in the relationship between Sprint and its suppliers or vendors.\nThe occurrence of any of the foregoing could disrupt subscribers\u2019 service, result in a decrease in our subscribers or adversely affect our ability to attract new subscribers.\nIf Sprint does not continue to enhance its nationwide digital wireless network, we may not be able to attract and retain subscribers.\nOur wireless operations are dependent on Sprint\u2019s national network. Sprint\u2019s digital wireless network may not provide nationwide coverage to the same extent as the networks of its competitors, which could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain subscribers. Sprint currently covers a significant portion of the population of the United States, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Sprint offers wireless services, either on its own network or through its roaming agreements, in every part of the United States.\nIf Sprint\u2019s wireless licenses are not renewed or are revoked, our wireless business would be harmed.\nNon-renewal or revocation by the FCC of Sprint\u2019s wireless licenses would significantly harm us. Wireless spectrum licenses are subject to renewal and revocation by the FCC. There may be opposition to renewal of Sprint\u2019s wireless licenses upon their expiration, and Sprint\u2019s wireless licenses may not be renewed. The FCC has adopted specific standards to apply to wireless license renewals. Any failure by Sprint to comply with these standards could cause revocation or forfeiture of Sprint\u2019s wireless licenses.\nIf Sprint does not maintain control over its licensed spectrum, our Sprint agreements may be terminated, which would render us unable to continue providing service to our subscribers. Sprint may also need additional spectrum to keep up with customer demands and the availability and cost of this spectrum could impact our wireless business.\nRisks Related to Our Cable Services\nOur cable segment faces risks from increasing competition for the provision of video services, including competition resulting from new technologies.\nIncumbent cable companies, which have historically provided video service, face competition from direct broadcast satellite providers, and more recently from large providers of wireline telecommunications services (such as Verizon, Centurylink and AT&T), which have begun to upgrade their networks to provide video services in addition to voice and broadband services. Wireless providers are also entering the market for video services by making such services available on handsets and tablets. In some areas, direct broadcast satellite providers have partnered with large incumbent telecommunications service providers to offer triple-play services. Moreover, consumers are increasingly accessing video content from alternative sources, such as Internet-based \u201cover the top\u201d providers (such as Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu) and applications. The influx of competitors in this area, together with the development of new technologies to support them, are resulting in significant changes in the video business models and regulatory provisions that have applied to the provision of video and other services. These developments may lead to a decline in the demand, price and profitability of our cable and related video services.\nOur programming costs are subject to demands for increased payments.\nThe cable television industry has continued to experience an increase in the cost of programming, especially sports programming. In addition, as we add programming to our video services for existing customers or distribute existing programming to more customers, we incur increased programming expenses. Broadcasters affiliated with major over-the-air network services have been increasing their demands for cash payments and other concessions for the right to carry local network television signals on our cable systems. If we are unable to raise our customers\u2019 rates or offset such increased programming and retransmission consent costs through the sale of additional services, these increased costs could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Moreover, as our programming contracts and retransmission agreements with programming providers expire, there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms. The Copyright Office adopted rules in 2014 governing private audits of cable operators\u2019 compulsory copyright payments, and any resulting audits initiated by copyright owners could lead to demands for increased copyright payments.\nChanges to key regulatory requirements can affect our ability to compete.\nAs programming and retransmission consent costs and retail rates increase, Congress and the FCC have expressed concern about the impact on consumers, and they could impose restrictions affecting cable rates and programming packages that could adversely impact our existing business model.\nThe Company operates cable television systems in largely rural areas of Virginia, West Virginia and Maryland. Virginia has adopted legislation to make it easier for companies to obtain local franchises to provide cable television service. The FCC has adopted rules which substantially reduce the cost of obtaining a local franchise. These rules may make it easier for the Company to expand its cable television business, but also may result in increased competition for such business.\nMany franchises establish comprehensive facilities and service requirements, as well as specific customer service standards and monetary penalties for non-compliance. In many cases, franchises are terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with significant provisions set forth in the franchise agreement governing system operations. Franchises are generally granted for fixed terms and must be periodically renewed. Franchising authorities may resist granting a renewal if either past performance or the prospective operating proposal is considered inadequate. Franchise authorities often demand concessions or other commitments as a condition to renewal. Our local franchises may not be renewed at expiration in which case we would have to cease operations or, operate under either temporary operating agreements or without a franchise while negotiating renewal terms with the local franchising authorities. We cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with all significant provisions of our franchise agreements. Additionally, although historically we have renewed our franchises without incurring significant costs, we cannot assure you that we will be able to renew, or to renew as favorably, our franchises in the future. A termination of or a sustained failure to renew a franchise in one or more key markets or obtaining such franchise on unfavorable terms could adversely affect our business in the affected geographic area.\nPole attachments are wires and cables that are attached to utility poles. Cable system attachments to investor-owned public utility poles historically have been regulated at the federal or state level, generally resulting in reasonable pole attachment rates for attachments used to provide cable service. In contrast, utility poles owned by municipalities or cooperatives are not subject to federal regulation and are generally exempt from state regulation and their attachment rates tend to be higher. Future regulatory changes in this area could impact the pole attachment rates we pay utility companies.\nSince 2014, the FCC has considered proposals for new regulations intended to make our cable set-top boxes open to other service providers. If enacted, such new regulations concerning set-top boxes could increase our cost for equipment, affect our relationship with our customers, and/or enable third parties to try to offer equipment that accesses disaggregated cable content merged with other services delivered over the Internet to compete with our premium service offerings.\nAny significant impairment of our non-amortizing cable franchise rights would lead to a decrease in our assets and a reduction in our net operating performance.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had non-amortizing cable franchise rights of approximately $64.3 million which constituted approximately 4.3% of total assets at that date. If we make changes in our business strategy or if market or other conditions adversely affect our cable operations, we may be forced to record an impairment charge, which\nwould lead to a decrease in the carrying value of the Company\u2019s assets and reduction in our net operating performance. We test non-amortizing intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record an impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the non-amortizing intangible assets and the fair value of the non-amortizing intangible assets, in the period in which the determination is made. The testing of non-amortizing intangible assets for impairment requires the Company to make significant estimates about the future performance and cash flows of our Cable segment, as well as other assumptions. These estimates can be affected by numerous factors, including changes in economic, industry or market conditions, changes in underlying business operations, future reporting unit operating performance, changes in competition, or changes in technologies. Any changes to key assumptions about our Cable segment\u2019s business and its future prospects, and actual performance compared with those assumptions, or other assumptions, could affect the fair value of our Cable segment non-amortizing intangibles, resulting in an impairment charge.\nRisks Related To Our Broadband Services\nOur broadband services may be adversely impacted by legislative or regulatory changes that affect our ability to develop and offer services or that could expose us to liability from customers or others.\nThe Company provides broadband Internet access services to its cable and telephone customers through cable modems and DSL. The FCC has adopted \u201copen Internet\u201d rules, also referred to as \u201cnet neutrality,\u201d that could affect the Company\u2019s provision of broadband services.\nOn February 26, 2015, in response to a federal appellate court ruling invalidating the FCC\u2019s initial \u201copen Internet\u201d rules, the FCC adopted an order imposing new rules regulating broadband Internet access service. The Order reclassifies wireline and wireless broadband services as Title II common carrier services, and asserts legal authority to regulate broadband service offered by ISPs under Title II, Title III, and Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act. In an effort to protect consumers and edge providers, the new rules would prohibit ISPs from engaging in blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization, and the existing transparency rules would be enhanced. Reasonable network management activities would remain permitted. For the first time, under this Order the FCC has authority to hear complaints and take enforcement action if it determines that the interconnection of ISPs are not just and reasonable, or if ISPs fail to meet a new general obligation not to harm consumers or edge providers. The Order forbears (at least for now) from certain Title II regulation, such as rate regulation, tariffs and last-mile unbundling. It does not propose assessment of USF fees on broadband at this time. The Order has been appealed by multiple parties, but the rules are currently in effect. The Order could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. There are also legislative proposals in Congress to preempt the FCC Chairman\u2019s proposed \u201cutility-style\u201d regulation, while still addressing many of the underlying concerns. The FCC may revisit its decision to extend Title II obligations to broadband providers at some point in the future. We do not know at the current time if the new regulations will survive judicial review, nor do we know how they would be administered if they do, but they could limit our ability to efficiently manage our cable systems and respond to operational and competitive challenges. Such rules or statutes could also restrict arrangements between us and Internet content, application, and service providers, including backbone connection arrangements. In addition, if the FCC were to adopt new rules under a Title II framework, the reclassification of broadband services as Title II common carrier services could subject our services to far more extensive and burdensome federal and state regulation.\nOn January 29, 2015, the FCC, in a nation-wide proceeding evaluating whether \u201cadvanced broadband\u201d is being deployed in a reasonable and timely fashion, increased the minimum connection speeds required to qualify as advanced broadband service to 25 Mbps for downloads and 3 Mbps for uploads. As a result, the FCC concluded that advanced broadband was not being sufficiently deployed and initiated a new inquiry into what steps it might take to encourage broadband deployment. This action may lead the FCC to adopt additional measures affecting our broadband business. At the same time, the FCC has ongoing proceedings to allocate additional spectrum for advanced wireless service, which could provide additional wireless competition to our broadband business.\nThe FCC imposes obligations on telecommunications service providers, including broadband Internet access service providers, and multichannel video program distributors, like our cable company, intended to ensure that individuals with disabilities are able to access and use telecommunications and video programming services and equipment. We cannot predict the nature and pace these requirements and other developments, or the impact they may have on our operations.\nRisks Related to Our Voice Services\nOffering voice communications service may subject us to additional regulatory burdens, causing us to incur additional costs.\nWe offer voice communications services over our cable broadband network and continue to develop and deploy VoIP services. The FCC has ruled that competitive telephone companies that support VoIP services, such as those we offer our customers, are entitled to interconnect with incumbent providers of traditional telecommunications services, which ensures that our VoIP services can compete in the market. The scope of these interconnection rights are being reviewed in a current FCC proceeding, which may affect our ability to compete in the provision of voice services or result in additional costs. The FCC has also declared that certain VoIP services are not subject to traditional state public utility regulation. The full extent of the FCC preemption of state and local regulation of VoIP services is not yet clear. Expanding our offering of these services may require us to obtain certain additional authorizations. We may not be able to obtain such authorizations in a timely manner, or conditions could be imposed upon such licenses or authorizations that may not be favorable to us. Telecommunications companies generally are subject to other significant regulation which could also be extended to VoIP providers. If additional telecommunications regulations are applied to our VoIP service, it could cause us to incur additional costs.\nThe FCC has already extended certain traditional telecommunications carrier requirements to many VoIP providers such as us, including E911, USF collection, CALEA, privacy of CPNI, number porting, rural call completion, network outage reporting, disability access, rural call completion and discontinuance of service requirements. In November 2014, the FCC adopted an order imposing limited backup power obligations on providers of facilities-based fixed, residential voice services that are not otherwise line-powered, including our VoIP services. This became effective for providers with fewer than 100,000 U.S. customer lines in August 2016 and now requires the Company to disclose certain information to customers and to make available back up power at the point of sale.\nIn November 2011, the FCC released an order significantly changing the rules governing intercarrier compensation payments for the origination and termination of telephone traffic between carriers, including VoIP service providers like us. The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the rules in May 2014. The new rules will result in a substantial decrease in intercarrier compensation payments over a multi-year period. In addition, the potential transition of Local Number Portability Administrators may impact our ability to manage number porting and related tasks, and/or may result in additional costs arising from the transition to a new administrator.", "PERMNO": 88742, "SIC": 4812, "TIC": "SHEN"}
