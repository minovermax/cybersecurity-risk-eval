Before deciding to purchase, hold, or sell our common stock, you should consider carefully the risks described below in addition to the cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere and the other information contained in this Annual Report and in our other filings with the SEC, including subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be seriously harmed. This could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, resulting in a loss of all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related To Our Business\nWe are dependent on a limited number of customers.\nOur net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 were earned from thirty-two customers. During the year ended December 31, 2014, four customers represented approximately 55% of our consolidated net revenues.\nOur customer concentration may change significantly from period-to-period depending on a customer\u2019s product cycle and changes in our industry. The loss of a major customer, a reduction in net revenues of a major customer for any reason, or a failure of a major customer to fulfill its financial or other obligations due to us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and future revenue stream.\nWe are dependent on the ability of our customers to design, manufacture and sell their products that incorporate our touch technology, particularly in markets other than e-Readers and tablets.\nWe generate revenue through technology licensing agreements with companies which must be successful in designing, manufacturing and selling their products that incorporate our touch technology. The majority of our license fees earned in 2014, 2013 and 2012 were from customer shipments of e-Reader and tablet products. We expect that customer shipments of e-Readers and tablet products will decline in the future. If we are unable to expand our licenses beyond e-Readers and tablets or if our customers are not able to design, manufacture or sell their products, or are delayed in producing their products, our revenues, profitability, and liquidity, as well as our brand image, may be adversely affected.\nThe length of a customer\u2019s product development and release cycle depends on many factors outside of our control and could cause us to incur significant expenses without offsetting revenues, or revenues that vary significantly from quarter to quarter.\nThe development and release cycle for customer products is lengthy and unpredictable. Our customers often undertake significant evaluation and design in the qualification of our products, which contributes to a lengthy product release cycle. A customer\u2019s decision to purchase our technology often requires a lengthy approval process undertaken by several decision makers at the customer. The typical product development and release cycle is six to thirty-six months with new customers while existing customer lead times are typically six to nine months. The development and release cycle may be longer in some cases, particularly for automotive vehicle products. There is no assurance that a customer will adopt our technology after the evaluation or design phase. The lengthy and variable development and release cycle for products may also have a negative impact on the timing of our revenues, causing our revenues and results of operations to vary significantly from quarter to quarter.\nIf we fail to develop and introduce new touch technology successfully and in a cost effective and timely manner, we will not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenues will suffer.\nWe operate in a highly competitive, rapidly evolving environment, and our success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new touch technology that our customers and end users choose to buy. If we are unsuccessful at developing new touch technology that are appealing to our customers and end users with acceptable functionality, quality, prices and terms, we will not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenues will suffer. The development of new touch technology is very difficult and requires high levels of innovation and competence. The development process is also lengthy and costly. If we fail to anticipate our end users\u2019 needs or technological trends accurately or if we are unable to complete development in a cost effective and timely fashion, we will be unable to introduce new touch technology into the market or successfully compete with other providers. As we introduce new or enhanced touch technology or integrate new touch technology into new or existing customer products, we face risks including, among other things, disruption in customers\u2019 ordering patterns, inability to deliver new touch technology to meet customers\u2019 demand, possible product and technology defects, and potentially unfamiliar sales and support environments. Premature announcements or leaks of new products, features, or technologies may exacerbate some of these risks. Our failure to manage the transition to newer touch technology or the integration of newer technology into new or existing customer products could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe are dependent on Texas Instruments as a component supplier for our technology.\nOur business operates upon a technology licensing model. We do not manufacture products or components. Under our licensing model, OEMs and ODMs manufacture or contract to manufacture controller chips containing our touch technology. As an alternative to sourcing controller chips, our customers may opt to use customized NN1001 and NN1002 optical controller chips developed in collaboration with Texas Instruments designed specifically for our optical touch technology. These controller chips can only be sold to customers who have a technology license agreement with us. As part of their product development process, our customers must qualify the chip components used in our products. If the controller chips provided by Texas Instruments experience quality control problems, our technology may be disqualified by one or more of our customers. Our dependence on Texas Instruments to supply controller chips with our touch technology exposes us to a number of risks including their inability to obtain an adequate supply of components, the failure to meet our customer requirements, or their failure to remain in business or adjust to market conditions. If our customers are unable to obtain controller chips with our touch technology, we may not be able to meet demand, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control.\nAs a result of our limited operating history and the nature of the markets in which we compete, it is extremely difficult for us to forecast accurately. We base our current and future expense levels largely on our investment plans and estimates of future events, although certain of our expense levels are, to a large extent, fixed. We may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall. Accordingly, any significant shortfall in revenues relative to our planned expenditures would have an immediate adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, we are subject to the following factors, among others, that may negatively affect and cause fluctuations in our operating results:\n\u00b7 the announcement or introduction of new products or technologies by our competitors;\n\u00b7 our ability to upgrade and develop our infrastructure to accommodate growth;\n\u00b7 our ability to attract and retain key personnel in a timely and cost effective manner;\n\u00b7 technical difficulties;\n\u00b7 the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the expansion of our business, operations, and infrastructure; and\n\u00b7 general economic conditions as well as economic conditions specific to the touchscreen industry.\nFurther, as a strategic response to changes in the competitive environment, we may from time to time make certain pricing, service, or marketing decisions that could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Due to the foregoing factors, our revenues and operating results are and will remain difficult to forecast.\nWe have had a history of losses and may require additional capital to fund our operations, which capital may not be available on commercially attractive terms or at all.\nWe have experienced substantial net losses in each fiscal period since our inception. These net losses resulted from a lack of substantial revenues and the significant costs incurred in the development and acceptance of our technology. We may in the future require sources of capital in addition to cash on hand to continue operations and to implement our business plan. We project that we have sufficient liquid assets to continue operating for at least the next twelve months. However, if our operations do not become cash flow positive, we may be forced to seek credit line facilities from financial institutions, equity investments, or debt arrangements. No assurances can be given that we will be successful in obtaining such additional financing on reasonable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available when needed on acceptable terms, or at all, we may be unable to adequately fund our business plan, which could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe must significantly enhance our sales and technology development organizations.\nWe will need to improve the effectiveness and breadth of our sales efforts in order to increase market awareness and sales of our technology, especially as we expand into new market segments. Competition for qualified sales personnel is intense, and we may not be able to hire the kind and number of sales personnel we are targeting. Likewise, our efforts to improve and refine our technology require skilled engineers and programmers. Competition for professionals capable of expanding our research and development efforts is intense due to the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills. If we are unable to identify, hire, or retain qualified sales, marketing, and technical personnel, our ability to achieve future revenue may be adversely affected.\nWe will need to increase the size of our organization, and we may be unable to manage our growth effectively.\nOur failure to manage growth effectively could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We anticipate that expansion of our organization will be required to address internal growth to handle licensing and research activities. This expansion may place a significant strain on management, operational, and financial resources. To manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel, we must both improve our existing operational and financial systems, procedures, and controls, and implement new systems, procedures, and controls. We must also expand our finance, administrative, and operations staff. Our current personnel, systems, procedures, and controls may not adequately support future operations. Management may be unable to hire, train, retain, motivate, and manage the necessary personnel, or to identify, manage and exploit existing and potential strategic relationships and market opportunities.\nWe may make acquisitions and strategic investments that are dilutive to existing shareholders, resulting in unanticipated accounting charges or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may decide to grow our business through business combinations or other acquisitions of businesses, products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing touch technology offerings, expand our market coverage, increase our workforce or enhance our technological capabilities. If we make any future acquisitions, we could issue stock that would dilute our shareholders\u2019 percentage ownership or we may incur substantial debt, reduce our cash reserves and/or assume contingent liabilities. Further, acquisitions and strategic investments may result in material charges, adverse tax consequences, substantial depreciation, deferred compensation charges, in-process research and development charges, and the amortization of amounts related to deferred compensation and identifiable purchased intangible assets or impairment of goodwill. Any of these could negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe are dependent on the services of our key personnel.\nOur senior management team consists of two executive officers. Our Chief Executive Officer is one of the founders of our Company. The unplanned loss of the services of any member of management could have a materially adverse effect on our operations and future prospects.\nOur revenues and growth are dependent on licensing fees from our intellectual property.\nOur success depends in large part on our proprietary technology and other intellectual property rights. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, confidentiality provisions, and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Our intellectual property, particularly our patents, may not provide us with a significant competitive advantage. If we fail to protect or to enforce our intellectual property rights successfully, our competitive position could suffer, which could harm our results of operations. Our pending patent applications for registration may not be allowed, or others may challenge the validity or scope of our patents. Even if our patents registrations are issued and maintained, these patents may not be of adequate scope or benefit to us or may be held invalid and unenforceable against third parties. We may need to expend significant resources to secure and protect our intellectual property. The loss of intellectual property rights may adversely impact our ability to generate revenues and expand our business.\nIf third parties infringe upon our intellectual property, we may expend significant resources enforcing our rights or suffer competitive injury.\nExisting laws, contractual provisions and remedies afford only limited protection for our intellectual property. We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights. Effective policing of the unauthorized use of our technology or intellectual property is difficult and litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights. Intellectual property litigation is not only expensive, but time-consuming, regardless of the merits of any claim, and could divert attention of our management from operating the business. Intellectual property lawsuits are subject to inherent uncertainties due to, among other things, the complexity of the technical issues involved, and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in asserting our intellectual property rights. Attempts may be made to copy or reverse engineer aspects of our technology or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. We may not be able to detect infringement and may lose competitive position in the market before they do so. In addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies. We cannot assure you that we will be able to protect our proprietary rights against unauthorized third party copying or use. The unauthorized use of our technology or of our proprietary information by competitors could have an adverse effect on our ability to sell our technology.\nThe laws of foreign countries may not provide protection of our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, which may make it more difficult for us to protect our intellectual property.\nAs part of our business strategy, we target customers and relationships with suppliers and original equipment manufacturers in countries with large populations and propensities for adopting new technologies. However, many of these countries do not address misappropriation of intellectual property nor deter others from developing similar, competing technologies or intellectual property. Effective protection of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries. In particular, the laws of some foreign countries in which we do business may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. As a result, we may not be able to effectively prevent competitors in these regions from infringing our intellectual property rights, which could reduce our competitive advantage and ability to compete in those regions and negatively impact our business.\nWe have an international presence in countries and must manage currency risks.\n\tA significant portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (the currency in which our consolidated financial statements are reported), primarily the Swedish Krona and, to a lesser extent, the Euro, Japanese Yen and Korean Won. For the year ended December 31, 2014, our revenues from the U.S., Asia, and Europe were 60%, 35%, and 5% respectively. We incur a significant portion of our expenses in Swedish Krona, including a significant portion of our research and development expenses and a substantial portion of our general and administrative expenses. As a result, appreciation of the value of the Swedish Krona relative to the other currencies, particularly the U.S. dollar, could adversely affect operating results. We do not currently undertake hedging transactions to cover our currency exposure, but we may choose to hedge a portion of our currency exposure in the future as it deems appropriate.\nIf we are unable to remediate and detect material weaknesses in our internal control, our financial report and our Company may be adversely affected.\nAs discussed in \u201cPart II-Item 9A - Controls and Procedures,\u201d our management has concluded that we did not have adequate controls designed and in place for our quarterly and annual financial close processes relating to intercompany adjustments and accounting for complex transactions. Although this control deficiency did not result in a material misstatement in the consolidated financial statements, we have concluded that material weaknesses exist in our internal control over financial reporting. We are currently working to remediate the material weaknesses. We cannot be sure when we will successfully remediate the material weaknesses or whether compensating controls will be effective before then in preventing or detecting material errors. The remediation may require substantial time and resources to successfully implement. Moreover, these material weaknesses and the financial statement errors we have had in the past or may have in the future could cause investors, creditors, distributors, customers, rating agencies, regulators and others to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our internal controls and the accuracy of our financial statements and other information, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Owning Our Stock\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the Delaware General Corporation Law contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control.\nOur Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders. The rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to, and may be materially adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future. The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. Furthermore, certain other provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an anti-takeover law.\nOur stock price has been volatile, and your investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value.\nThere has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of equity securities, which is unrelated to the financial performance of the companies issuing the securities. These broad market fluctuations may negatively affect the market price of our common stock. You may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you pay for those shares due to fluctuations in the market price of our common stock caused by changes in our operating performance or prospects, and other factors.\nSome factors that may have a significant effect on our common stock market price include:\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results or future prospects;\n\u00b7 our announcements or our competitors\u2019 announcements of new technology;\n\u00b7 the public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements, and our filings with the SEC;\n\u00b7 strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u00b7 new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u00b7 changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u00b7 changes in our growth rates or our competitors\u2019 growth rates;\n\u00b7 developments regarding our patents or proprietary rights or those of our competitors;\n\u00b7 our inability to raise additional capital as needed;\n\u00b7 concern as to the efficacy of our technology;\n\u00b7 changes in financial markets or general economic conditions;\n\u00b7 sales of common stock by us or members of our management team; and\n\u00b7 changes in stock market analyst recommendations or earnings estimates regarding our common stock, other comparable companies, or our industry generally.\nFuture sales of our common stock by our stockholders could negatively affect our stock price.\nDuring 2011 and 2013, officers and directors of Neonode sold shares of our common stock in public offerings. In May 2014, Neonode sold to an institutional investor 2,500,000 shares of common stock and a warrant that may be exercised by November 15, 2015 to purchase an additional 2,500,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $5.09 per share. The common stock and shares issuable upon exercise of the warrant from the May 2014 offering can be resold pursuant to a registration statement that we filed which became effective in June 2014. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by insiders or large stockholders, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.\nFuture sales of our common stock by us could adversely affect its price, and our future capital-raising activities could involve the issuance of equity securities, which would dilute your investment and could result in a decline in the trading price of our common stock.\nOur long-term success is dependent on us obtaining sufficient capital to fund our operations and to develop our touch technology, and bringing our technology to the worldwide market to obtain sufficient sales volume to be profitable. We may sell securities in the public or private equity markets if and when conditions are favorable, even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time. Sales of substantial amounts of common stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital. We may issue additional common stock in future financing transactions or as incentive compensation for our executive management and other key personnel, consultants and advisors. Issuing any equity securities would be dilutive to the equity interests represented by our then-outstanding shares of common stock. The market price for our common stock could decrease as the market takes into account the dilutive effect of any of these issuances. Furthermore, we may enter into financing transactions at prices that represent a substantial discount to the market price of our common stock. A negative reaction by investors and securities analysts to any discounted sale of our equity securities could result in a decline in the trading price of our common stock.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or if securities analysts or other third parties publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will rely in part on the research and reports that securities analysts and other third parties choose to publish about us. We do not control these analysts or other third parties. The price of our common stock could decline if one or more securities analysts downgrade our common stock or if one or more securities analysts or other third parties publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us or cease publishing reports about us.", "PERMNO": 68145, "SIC": 3663, "TIC": "NEON"}
