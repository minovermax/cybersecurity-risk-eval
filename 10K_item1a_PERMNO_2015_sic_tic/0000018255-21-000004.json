Adverse\nfinancial impacts associated\nwith the outbreak\ninclude, but are\nnot limited to,\n(i) lower net\nsales in markets\naffected by the\nactual or potential\noutbreak, whether due to\nstate and local\norders to\nclose stores,\nreductions in\nstore traffic\nand customer\ndemand,\nlabor shortages,\nor all\nof these\nfactors, (ii) lower net sales caused\nby the delay of inventory production and fulfillment,\n(iii) and\nincremental costs\nassociated with\nefforts to\nmitigate the\neffects of\nthe outbreak,\nincluding increased\nfreight and logistics costs and other expenses.\nThe COVID\n-19 pandemic\nhas caused\nstate and\nlocal governments\nto issue\norders mandating\nstore\nclosures and other\nmeasures to mitigate\nthe spread of\nthe virus. In\naddition, public health\nofficials have\nissued precautions and\nguidance intended to\nreduce the spread\nof the virus,\nincluding particular cautions\nabout congregating in\nlarge groups\nor heavily populated\nareas, such as\nmalls and shopping\ncenters. We\ntemporarily closed\nall Cato,\nIt\u2019s Fashion,\nIt\u2019s Fashion\nMetro and\nVersona\nstores on\nMarch 19,\n2020.\nBeginning on May 1, 2020, we began to re-open stores based on the pertinent state and local orders. As of\nJune 15, 2020,\nall stores\nwere re-opened,\nbut our stores\nhave been and continue\nto operate at reduced\nhours.\nPeriodic\nincreases\nin infection\nrates in\ncommunities\nwhere our\nstores are\nlocated\nmay prompt\nfurther\ngovernmental\nmeasures\nor public\nhealth guidance\nto reduce\npublic activity\nand gatherings\nin order\nto mitigate\nthe spread of the virus,\nand may also continue\nto adversely\naffect consumer\nconfidence.\nThere continues to\nbe significant uncertainty\nregarding the breadth\n,\nseverity and duration\nof business disruptions\nrelated to\nCOVID-19, as well as its impact on the global and U.S. economy, consumer willingness to visit malls and\nshopping centers,\nand its\nimpact on\nappropriate associate\nstaffing levels\nfor our\nstores. The\nstatus and\neffects of\nnational, state\nor local\naction, initiatives,\nlegislation, guidelines\nor programs\nthat attempt\nto\nmitigate the\nspread of\nCOVID-19 or\naddress its\neconomic effects\non our\ncustomers, suppliers\nor the\nCompany also remain fluid.\nWhile the Company currently\nanticipates that our\nresults for fiscal\n2021 and possibly beyond\nwill be\nadversely impacted,\nthe extent\nto which\nCOVID-19 impacts the\nCompany\u2019s results\nwill depend\non the\ncourse of future developments, which are highly uncertain,\nincluding the relative speed and success of, as\nwell as\npublic confidence\nin, mitigation\nmeasures such\nas the\ncurrent effort\nto vaccinate\nsubstantial\nportions of the\nU.S. and global\npopulation, emerging information\nregarding variants of\nthe virus or\nnew\nviruses and their\npotential impact on\ncurrent mitigation efforts,\npublic attitudes toward\ncontinued\ncompliance with containment\nand mitigation measures, and\npossible new information and\nunderstanding\nthat could alter the course and duration of current measures to combat the spread\nof\nthe virus.\nIt is also possible\nthe COVID-19 pandemic may\nresult in longer term\nbehavioral changes by\ncustomers and\nothers that\ncould adversely\naffect our\nbusiness, including\nbut not\nlimited to\na consumer\nshift to greater reliance\non online versus in-person shopping,\nwhich could reduce traffic\nto our stores and\nmore broadly\nto the\nstrip shopping\ncenters and\nmalls in\nwhich most\nof our\nstores are\nlocated and\ndisadvantage us relative to competitors\nwho are better established in\ne-commerce sales, and reductions in\nface-to-face work, travel and socializing occasions, which may lead customers to less\nfrequently desire or\nperceive the need to update their wardrobes.\nThe far-reaching impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic may also intensify other risks we discuss in\nthis\nreport and other filings we make from time to time with the SEC.\nFuture outbreaks of\ndisease or\nsimilar public\nhealth threats,\nor the\nfear of\nsuch an\noccurrence, may\nalso have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results.\nRisks Relating to Our Business:\nUnusual weather, natural disasters,\npublic health threats or similar events may adversely affect\nour sales or\noperations.\nExtreme changes\nin weather,\nnatural disasters,\npublic health\nthreats or\nsimilar events\ncan influence\ncustomer trends and\nshopping habits.\nFor example, heavy\nrainfall or other\nextreme weather conditions\n,\nincluding but\nnot limited\nto winter\nweather over\na prolonged\nperiod, might\nmake it\ndifficult for\nour\ncustomers to\ntravel to\nour stores\nand thereby\nreduce our\nsales and\nprofitability.\nOur business\nis also\nsusceptible to\nunseasonable weather conditions.\nFor example, extended\nperiods of\nunseasonably warm\ntemperatures during the\nwinter season or\ncool weather during\nthe summer season\ncould render a\nportion\nof our\ninventory incompatible\nwith those\nunseasonable conditions.\nReduced sales\nfrom extreme\nor\nprolonged unseasonable\nweather conditions\nwould adversely\naffect our\nbusiness.\nThe occurrence\nor\nthreat of\nextreme weather,\nnatural disasters,\npower outages,\nterrorist acts,\noutbreaks of\nflu or\nother\ncommunicable diseases\n(such as\nthe global\nCOVID-19 pandemic)\nor other\ncatastrophic events\ncould\nreduce customer traffic\nin our stores\nand likewise disrupt\nour ability to\nconduct operations, which\ncould\nmaterially and adversely affect us.\nBecause we source a significant portion of our merchandise directly\nand indirectly from overseas, we are\nsubject to risks associated with international operations and\nrisks that affect the prevailing social, economic,\npolitical, public health and other conditions in the areas from\nwhich we source merchandise; changes,\ndisruptions, cost changes or other problems affecting\nthe Company\u2019s merchandise\nsupply chain could\nmaterially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.\nA significant amount of our\nmerchandise is manufactured overseas, principally in Southeast\nAsia. We\ndirectly import some of this merchandise and indirectly import\nthe remaining merchandise from domestic\nvendors who acquire\nthe merchandise from\nforeign sources. Further,\nour third-party vendors\nare\ndependent on\nmaterials primarily\nsourced from\nChina.\nAs a\nresult, political\nunrest, labor\ndisputes,\nterrorism, public health\nthreats, including but\nnot limited\nto communicable diseases\n(such as\nthe global\nCOVID-19 pandemic), financial or other forms of\ninstability or other events resulting in\nthe disruption of\ntrade from\ncountries affecting\nour supply\nchain, increased\nsecurity requirements\nfor imported\nmerchandise, or\nthe imposition of,\nor changes in,\nlaws, regulations or\nchanges in duties,\nquotas, tariffs,\ntaxes or governmental policies regarding these matters or other\nfactors affecting the availability or cost of\nimports, could cause\nsignificant delays or\ninterruptions in the\nsupply of our\nmerchandise or increase\nour\ncosts. We\nare also\nsubject to\nsupply chain\ndisruptions affecting\nocean freight,\nincluding lack\nof ocean\ncontainer ship\ncapacity, lack\nof equipment\nsuch as\ncontainers, port\ncongestion and\nother conditions\nimpacting ocean\nfreight.\nWe also\nare subject\nto domestic\nsupply chain\ndisruptions,\nincluding lack\nof\ndomestic intermodal\ntransportation (trucks\nand drivers),\ndomestic port\ncongestion and\nother conditions\nthat ma\ny\nimpact domestic\nsupply chain.\nThese supply\nchain risks\nmay result\nin both\nhigher costs\nto\ntransport our merchandise and delayed merchandise arrivals to our stores, which may adversely affect our\nability to\nsell this\nmerchandise and\nincrease markdowns\nof it.\nOur costs\nare also\naffected by\ncurrency\nfluctuations, and changes in the\nvalue of the dollar relative\nto foreign currencies may increase our\ncost of\ngoods sold.\nAny of\nthese factors\ncould have\na material\nadverse effect\non our\nbusiness and\nresults of\noperations.\nIn addition, increased energy and transportation\ncosts have caused us significant\ncost\nincreases from time\nto time, and\nfuture adverse changes in\nthese costs or\nthe disruption of\nthe means by\nwhich merchandise\nis transported\nto us\ncould cause\nadditional cost\nincreases or\ninterruptions of\nour\nsupply chain which could be significant. Further, we are subject to increased costs or potential disruptions\nimpacting any port\nor trade\nroute through which\nour products\nmove or we\nmay be\nsubject to\nincreased\ncosts and\ndelays if\nforced to\nroute freight\nthrough different\nports than\nthe ones\nthrough which\nour\nproducts typically move.\nIf we are\nforced to source\nmerchandise from other\ncountries or other\ndomestic\nvendors with foreign sources\nin different countries, those\ngoods may be more\nexpensive or of a\ndifferent\nor inferior quality from the ones we now sell.\nThe inability of third-party vendors to produce goods on\ntime and to the Company\u2019s\nspecification may\nadversely affect the Company\u2019s\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur dependence\non third-\nparty vendors\nto manufacture\nand supply\nour merchandise\nsubjects us\nto\nnumerous risks that our\nvendors will fail to\nperform as we expect.\nFor example, the deterioration\nin any\nof our key\nvendors\u2019 financial condition,\ntheir failure to\nship merchandise in\na timely manner\nthat meets\nour specifications, or\nother failures to\nfollow our vendor\nguidelines or comply\nwith applicable laws\nand\nregulations, including\ncompliant labor,\nenvironmental practices\nand product\nsafety, could\nexpose us\nto\noperational, quality,\ncompetitive, reputational and\nlegal risks.\nIf we are\nnot able to\ntimely or adequately\nreplace the merchandise we currently source\nwith merchandise produced elsewhere, or if our\nvendors fail\nto perform as\nwe expect,\nour business,\nresults of\noperations and financial\ncondition could\nbe adversely\naffected.\nActivities conducted\nby us\nor on\nour behalf\noutside the\nUnited States\nfurther subject\nus to\nnumerous U.S. and international regulations and compliance risks, as discussed\nbelow under \u201cRisk\nFactors - Risks\nRelating to Accounting\nand Legal Matters\n- Our business\noperations subject us\nto legal\ncompliance and litigation risks,\nas well as regulations\nand regulatory enforcement priorities,\nwhich could\nresult in increased costs or liabilities, divert our\nmanagement\u2019s attention or otherwise adversely affect\nour\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.\u201d\nOur ability to attract consumers and grow our revenues is dependent\non the success of our store location\nstrategy and our ability to successfully open new stores as planned.\nOur sales are dependent\nin part on\nthe location of our\nstores in shopping centers\nand malls where we\nbelieve our consumers\nand potential consumers\nshop.\nIn addition, our\nability to grow\nour revenues has\nbeen substantially dependent on our ability to secure space for and open new stores in attractive locations.\nShopping centers and malls where we currently operate existing stores\nor seek to open new stores may be\nadversely affected by, among other\nthings, general economic downturns or those particularly affecting the\ncommercial real\nestate industry,\nthe closing\nof anchor\nstores, changes\nin tenant\nmix and\nchanges in\ncustomer shopping preferences, including but not limited to an increase in preference for online versus in-\nperson shopping.\nTo take\nadvantage of consumer traffic\nand the shopping preferences of\nour consumers,\nwe need to maintain and acquire stores in desirable locations where competition\nfor suitable store\nlocations is\nintense. A\ndecline in customer\npopularity of the\nstrip shopping centers\nwhere we generally\nlocate our stores or in\navailability of space in desirable centers\nand locations, or an increase in\nthe cost of\nsuch desired\nspace, could\nlimit our\nability to\nopen new\nstores, adversely\naffect consumer\ntraffic and\nreduce our sales and net earnings or increase our operating costs.\nOur ability to\nopen and operate\nnew stores depends\non many factors,\nsome of which\nare beyond our\ncontrol.\nThese factors\ninclude, but\nare not\nlimited to,\nour ability\nto identify\nsuitable store\nlocations,\nnegotiate acceptable lease terms, secure necessary governmental\npermits and approvals and hire and\ntrain\nappropriate store personnel.\nIn addition, our continued\nexpansion into new regions\nof the country where\nwe have\nnot done\nbusiness before\nmay present\nnew challenges\nin competition, distribution\nand\nmerchandising as we enter these new markets. Our failure to successfully and timely\nexecute our plans for\nopening new stores or\nthe failure of these\nstores to perform up\nto our expectations could\nadversely affect\nour business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to anticipate, identify and respond to\nrapidly changing fashion trends and customer\ndemands in a timely manner,\nour business and results of operations could materially\nsuffer.\nCustomer tastes\nand fashion\ntrends, particularly\nfor women\u2019s\napparel, are\nvolatile, tend\nto change\nrapidly and cannot be predicted\nwith certainty.\nOur success depends in part\nupon our ability to\nconsistently anticipate, design and respond to changing merchandise trends and consumer preferences in a\ntimely manner.\nAccordingly, any\nfailure by\nus to\nanticipate, identify,\ndesign and\nrespond to\nchanging\nfashion trends\ncould adversely\naffect c\nonsumer acceptance\nof our\nmerchandise, which\nin turn\ncould\nadversely affect our business, results of\noperations and our image with our customers.\nIf we miscalculate\neither the market\nfor our merchandise\nor our customers\u2019 tastes\nor purchasing habits, we\nmay\nbe required\nto sell a significant amount of unsold inventory at below-average markups over cost, or below cost, which\nwould adversely affect our margins and results of operations.\nFluctuating comparable sales or our inability to effectively\nmanage inventory may negatively impact our\ngross margin and our overall results of operations.\nComparable sales\nare expected\nto continue\nto fluctuate\nin the\nfuture. Factors\naffecting comparable\nsales include\nfashion trends,\ncustomer preferences,\ncalendar and\nholiday shifts,\ncompetition, weather,\nactual or\npotential public\nhealth threats\nand economic\nconditions. In\naddition, merchandise\nmust be\nordered well in\nadvance of the\napplicable selling season\nand before trends\nare confirmed by\nsales. If we\nare not\nable to accurately\npredict customers\u2019 preferences\nfor our\nfashion items, we\nmay have too\nmuch\ninventory, which may\ncause excessive markdowns. If we\nare unable to accurately predict\ndemand for our\nmerchandise, we may\nend up with\ninventory shortages,\nresulting in missed\nsales. A decrease\nin\ncomparable sales or\nour inability to\neffectively manage inventory\nmay adversely affect\nour gross margin\nand results of operations.\nExisting and increased competition in the women\u2019s\nretail apparel industry may negatively impact our\nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition and market\nshare.\nThe women\u2019s\nretail apparel\nindustry is\nhighly competitive.\nWe compete\nprimarily with\ndiscount\nstores, mass\nmerchandisers, department\nstores, off\n-price retailers,\nspecialty stores\nand internet-\nbased\nretailers, many of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than\nwe have.\nMany of\nour competitors offer\nfrequent promotions and\nreduce their\nselling prices.\nIn some cases,\nour\ncompetitors are expanding into markets\nin which we have a\nsignificant market presence.\nIn addition, our\ncompetitors also compete\nfor the\nsame retail store space. As a result of this\ncompetition, we may\nexperience pricing\npressures, increased\nmarketing expenditures,\nincreased costs\nto open\nnew stores,\nas\nwell as loss of market share, which could materially and adversely affect\nour business, results of\noperations and financial condition.\nThe operation of our sourcing offices in Asia may\npresent increased legal and operational risks.\nIn October\n2014, we\nestablished our\nown sourcing\noffices in\nAsia. Our\nexperience with\nlegal and\nregulatory practices and requirements in Asia is\nlimited. If our sourcing offices are\nunable to successfully\noversee merchandise\nproduction to\nensure that\nproduct is\nproduced on\ntime and\nwithin the\nCompany\u2019s\nspecifications, our business, brand, reputation, costs, results of operations\nand\nfinancial condition could be\nmaterially and\nadversely affected.\nFurther, the\nactivities conducted\nby our\nsourcing offices\noutside the\nUnited States\nsubject us\nto foreign\noperational risks,\nas well\nas U.S.\nand international\nregulations and\ncompliance risks, as\ndiscussed elsewhere in\nthis \u201cRisk Factors\u201d\nsection, in particular\nbelow under \u201cRisk\nFactors - Risks\nRelating to Accounting\nand Legal Matters\n- Our business\noperations subject us\nto legal\ncompliance and litigation risks,\nas well as regulations\nand regulatory enforcement priorities,\nwhich could\nresult in increased costs or liabilities, divert our\nmanagement\u2019s attention or otherwise adversely affect\nour\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.\u201d\nAny actual or perceived deterioration in the conditions that drive\nconsumer confidence and spending may\nmaterially and adversely affect consumer demand\nfor our apparel and accessories and our results of\noperations.\nConsumer spending habits, including spending for our apparel and accessories, are affected by, among\nother things, prevailing social, economic, political and\npublic health conditions and uncertainties (such as\nmatters under debate in the U.S. from time to time regarding budgetary,\nspending and tax policies and the\nimpact of the\nglobal COVID-19 pandemic),\nlevels of employment,\nfuel, energy and\nfood costs, salaries\nand wage rates\nand other sources of\nincome, tax rates, home\nvalues, consumer net worth,\nthe availability\nof consumer\ncredit, consumer\nconfidence and\nconsumer perceptions\nof adverse\nchanges in\nor trends\naffecting any of\nthese conditions.\nAny perception that these\nconditions may be worsening\nor continuing\nto trend negatively may significantly weaken many of these drivers of consumer spending habits. Adverse\nperceptions of these\nconditions or uncertainties\nregarding them also\ngenerally cause consumers\nto defer\npurchases of\ndiscretionary items,\nsuch as\nour merchandise,\nor to\npurchase cheaper\nalternatives to\nour\nmerchandise, all of\nwhich may also\nadversely affect our\nnet sales and\nresults of operations.\nIn addition,\nnumerous events, whether\nor not\nrelated to actual\neconomic conditions, such\nas downturns in\nthe stock\nmarkets, acts\nof war\nor terrorism,\npolitical unrest\nor natural\ndisasters, outbreaks\nof disease\nor similar\nevents, may\nalso dampen\nconsumer confidence,\nand accordingly,\nlead to\nreduced consumer\nspending.\nAny of\nthese events\ncould have\na material\nadverse effect\non our\nbusiness, results\nof operations\nand\nfinancial condition.\nFluctuations in the price, availability and quality of\ninventory may result in higher cost of goods, which the\nCompany may not be able to pass on to its customers.\nVendors\nare increasingly passing on higher\nproduction costs, which may impact\nour ability to\nmaintain or grow\nour margins. The\nprice and availability\nof raw materials\nmay be impacted\nby demand,\nregulation, weather and\ncrop yields, currency\nvalue fluctuations, as\nwell as other\nfactors.\nAdditionally,\nmanufacturers have\nand may\ncontinue to\nhave increases\nin other\nmanufacturing costs,\nsuch as\ntransportation, labor and\nbenefit costs. These\nincreases in production\ncosts result in\nhigher merchandise\ncosts to the\nCompany. Due to\nthe Company\u2019s\nlimited flexibility in price\npoint, the Company may\nnot be\nable to pass\non those cost\nincreases to the\nconsumer, which\ncould have a\nmaterial adverse effect\non our\nresults of operations and financial condition.\nIf the Company is unable to successfully integrate new businesses into\nits existing business, the Company\u2019s\nfinancial condition and results of operations will be adversely\naffected.\nThe Company\u2019s\nlong-term business strategy\nincludes opportunistic growth\nthrough the development\nof new store\nconcepts. This growth may\nrequire significant capital expenditures\nand management\nattention. The Company may not\nrealize any of the anticipated\nbenefits of a new business\nand integration\ncosts may\nexceed anticipated\namounts. We\nhave incurred\nsubstantial financial\ncommitments and\nfixed\ncosts related to our retail stores that we will not be\nable to recover if our stores are not successful and that\ncould potentially result\nin impairment charges.\nIf we cannot\nsuccessfully execute our\ngrowth strategies,\nour financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nFailure to attract, train, and retain skilled personnel could adversely\naffect our business and our financial\ncondition.\nLike most retailers, we\nexperience significant associate turnover\nrates, particularly among store\nsales\nassociates and managers.\nBecause our continued store growth\nwill require the hiring and\ntraining of new\nassociates, we must\ncontinually attract, hire\nand train new\nstore associates to\nmeet our staffing\nneeds. A\nsignificant increase in the turnover rate among our store sales associates and managers would increase our\nrecruiting and\ntraining costs, as\nwell as\npossibly cause a\ndecrease in\nour store\noperating efficiency\nand\nproductivity.\nWe compete\nfor qualified store\nassociates,\nas well as\nexperienced management personnel,\nwith other companies in\nour industry or other\nindustries, many of whom\nhave greater financial resources\nthan we do.\nIn addition,\nwe depend\non key\nmanagement personnel\nto oversee\nthe operational\ndivisions of\nthe\nCompany for\nthe support\nof our\nexisting business\nand future\nexpansion. The\nsuccess of\nexecuting our\nbusiness strategy depends\nin large part\non retaining key\nmanagement. We\ncompete for key\nmanagement\npersonnel with\nother retailers, and\nour inability to\nattract and\nretain qualified personnel\ncould limit\nour\nability to continue to grow.\nIf we\nare unable\nto retain\nour key management\nand store\nassociates or\nattract, train,\nor retain\nother\nskilled personnel\nin the\nfuture, we\nmay not be\nable to service\nour customers effectively\nor execute\nour\nbusiness strategy, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Relating to Our Information Technology and Related Systems:\nA failure or disruption relating to our information technology\nsystems could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely\non our existing information technology systems for merchandise operations,\nincluding\nmerchandise planning, replenishment, pricing,\nordering, markdowns and\nproduct life cycle\nmanagement.\nIn addition to merchandise operations,\nwe utilize our information technology systems\nfor our distribution\nprocesses, as well\nas our financial\nsystems, including accounts\npayable, general ledger,\naccounts\nreceivable, sales, banking,\ninventory and fixed\nassets.\nDespite the precautions\nwe take, our\ninformation\nsystems are or may be vulnerable to disruption or failure\nfrom numerous events, including but not limited\nto, natural disasters, severe weather conditions, power outages, technical malfunctions, cyber-attacks, acts\nof war\nor terrorism,\nsimilar catastrophic\nevents or\nother causes\nbeyond our\ncontrol\nor that\nwe fail\nto\nanticipate. Any disruption or failure in the operation of our information technology systems, our failure to\ncontinue to\nupgrade or\nimprove such\nsystems, or\nthe cost\nassociated with\nmaintaining, repairing\nor\nimproving these systems,\ncould adversely affect\nour business, results\nof operations and\nfinancial\ncondition. Modifications and/or upgrades to our current\ninformation technology systems may also disrupt\nour operations.\nA disruption or shutdown of our centralized distribution center or\ntransportation network could materially\nand adversely affect our business and results of\noperations.\nThe distribution of\nour products is\ncentralized in one\ndistribution center in\nCharlotte, North Carolina\nand distributed\nthrough our\nnetwork of\nthird-party freight\ncarriers.\nThe merchandise\nwe purchase\nis\nshipped directly to our\ndistribution center, where it\nis prepared for shipment to\nthe appropriate stores and\nsubsequently delivered to\nthe stores\nby our\nthird-party freight carriers.\nIf the distribution\ncenter or\nour\nthird-party freight carriers were to be\nshut down or lose significant capacity\nfor any reason, including but\nnot limited to, any of the causes described above under \u201cA failure or disruption relating\nto our information\ntechnology systems could adversely affect\nour business,\u201d our operations would likely\nbe seriously\ndisrupted.\nSuch problems could occur as the result of any loss, destruction or impairment of our ability to\nuse our\ndistribution center,\nas well\nas any broader\nproblem generally affecting\nthe ability to\nship goods\ninto our distribution center or deliver goods to\nour stores.\nAs a result, we could incur significantly higher\ncosts and longer lead times associated\nwith distributing our products to our\nstores during the time it\ntakes\nfor us to reopen or replace the\ndistribution center and/or our transportation network. Any such occurrence\ncould adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nA security breach that results in unauthorized access to or disclosure\nof employee, Company or customer\ninformation could adversely affect our costs, reputation\nand results of operations, and efforts to mitigate\nthese risks may continue to increase our costs.\nThe protection\nof employee,\nCompany and\ncustomer data\nis critical\nto the\nCompany. Any\nsecurity\nbreach, mishandling, human or programming error or other event that results in the misappropriation, loss\nor other\nunauthorized disclosure\nof employee,\nCompany or\ncustomer information,\nincluding but\nnot\nlimited to credit card data or\nother personally identifiable information, could severely damage the\nCompany's reputation, expose it to remediation\nand other costs and the\nrisks\nof legal proceedings, disrupt\nits operations and otherwise adversely affect\nthe Company's business and financial\ncondition. The\nsecurity of certain of this\ninformation also depends on the\nability of third-party service providers,\nsuch as\nthose we\nuse to\nprocess credit\nand debit\ncard payments\nas described\nbelow under\n\u201cWe are\nsubject to\npayment-related risks,\u201d\nto properly\nhandle and\nprotect such\ninformation. Our\ninformation systems\nand\nthose of our third-party service\nproviders are subject to ongoing\nand persistent cybersecurity threats from\nthose seeking unauthorized access\nthrough means which are\ncontinually evolving and may be\ndifficult to\nanticipate or detect for long periods\nof time.\nDespite measures the Company takes to\nprotect confidential\ninformation against unauthorized\naccess or disclosure,\nwhich are ongoing\nand may continue\nto increase\nour costs, there\nis no assurance\nthat such measures\nwill prevent the\ncompromise of such\ninformation. If\nany such compromise\nor unauthorized access\nto or disclosure\nof this information\nwere to occur,\nit could\nhave a material\nadverse effect on\nthe Company's reputation,\nbusiness, operating results,\nfinancial\ncondition and cash flows.\nWe are subject to payment\n-related risks.\nWe accept\npayments using a\nvariety of methods,\nincluding third-party credit\ncards, our own\nbranded\ncredit cards,\ndebit cards,\ngift cards\nand physical\nand electronic\nbank checks.\nFor existing\nand future\npayment methods\nwe offer\nto our\ncustomers, we\nmay become\nsubject to\nadditional regulations\nand\ncompliance requirements\n(including obligations\nto implement\nenhanced authentication\nprocesses that\ncould result in\nincreased costs and\nreduce the ease\nof use of\ncertain payment methods),\nas well as\nfraud.\nFor certain payment methods,\nincluding credit and debi\nt\ncards, we pay interchange and\nother fees, which\nmay increase\nover time,\nraising our\noperating costs\nand lowering\nprofitability. We\nrely on\nthird-party\nservice providers for\npayment processing services,\nincluding the processing\nof credit and\ndebit cards. In\neach case, it could\ndisrupt our business if\nthese third-party service providers\nbecome unwilling or unable\nto provide these services to us. We\nare also subject to payment card association operating rules, including\ndata security rules, certification\nrequirements and rules governing electronic\nfunds transfers, which could\nchange or be\nreinterpreted to make\nit difficult or\nimpossible for us\nto comply.\nIf we fail\nto comply with\nthese rules\nor requirements,\nor if\nour data\nsecurity systems\nare breached\nor com\npromised, we\nmay be\nliable for card-issuing banks\u2019\ncosts, subject to fines\nand higher transaction fees.\nIn addition, we may\nlose\nour ability\nto accept\ncredit and\ndebit card\npayments from\nour customers\nand process\nelectronic funds\ntransfers or facilitate\nother types of\npayments, and our\nbusiness and operating\nresults could be\nadversely\naffected.\nThe Company\u2019s\nfailure to successfully operate its e-commerce websites or fulfill customer\nexpectations could\nadversely impact customer satisfaction, our reputation and\nour business.\nAlthough the\nCompany's e-commerce platform\nprovides another\nchannel to\ndrive incremental\nsales,\nprovide existing customers the on-\nline shopping experience and\nintroduce the Company to a\nnew\ncustomer base, it\nalso exposes us\nto numerous risks.\nWe are\nsubject to potential\nfailures in the\nefficient\nand uninterrupted operation of\nour websites, customer contact\ncenter or our distribution\ncenter, including\nsystem failures\ncaused by\ntelecommunication system\nproviders, order\nvolumes that\nexceed our\npresent\nsystem capabilities, electrical outages, mechanical problems\nand human error.\nOur e-commerce platform\nmay also expose us to\ngreater potential for security or\ndata breaches involving the unauthorized access\nto\nor disclosure of customer information, as discussed\nabove under \u201cA\nsecurity breach that\nresults in\nunauthorized disclosure of employee, Company or customer information could\nadversely affect our costs,\nreputation and\nresults of\noperations, and\nefforts to\nmitigate these\nrisks may\ncontinue to\nincrease our\ncosts.\u201d We\nare also subject to risk related\nto delays or failures in the\nperformance of third parties, such as\nshipping companies,\nincluding delays\nassociated with\nlabor strikes\nor slowdowns\nor adverse\nweather\nconditions. If the\nCompany does not successfully\nmeet the challenges of\noperating e-commerce websites\nor fulfilling customer expectations, the Company's business and sales could be\nadversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Accounting and Legal Matters:\nChanges to accounting rules and regulations may\nadversely affect our reported results of operations\nand\nfinancial condition.\nIn an\neffort to\nprovide greater\ncomparability of\nfinancial reporting\nin an\nincreasing global\nenvironment, accounting regulatory authorities have\nbeen in discussions for many\nyears regarding efforts\nto either converge U.S. Generally\nAccepted Accounting Principles with International Financial Reporting\nStandards (\u201cIFRS\u201d), have\nU.S. companies provide\nsupplemental IFRS-based information\nor continue to\nwork toward\na single\nset of\nglobally accepted\naccounting standards.\nIf implemented,\nthese potential\nchanges in accounting rules or regulations could\nsignificantly impact our future reported\nresults of\noperations and financial position.\nChanges in accounting rules\nor regulations and varying interpretations\nof existing accounting\nrules and regulations\nhave significantly affected\nour reported financial\nstatements\nand those of other participants in the retail industry in the past and may\ncontinue to do so in the future.\nFor example,\nchanges to\nlease accounting\nstandards effective\nfor the\nCompany beginning\nin fiscal\n2019 required\nthe Company\nto capitalize\noperating leases\nin its\nfinancial statements.\nThese changes\nrequired us\nto record\na significant\namount of\nlease-related assets\nand liabilities\non our\nbalance sheet,\nresulting in an\nincrease of 40%\nto each of\nour total assets\nand total liabilities\non our balance\nsheet, and\nrequired us\nto make\nother changes\nto the\nrecording and\nclassification of\nlease-related expenses\non our\nstatements of income and cash flows. These changes\ncould lead to the perception by investors\nthat we are\nhighly leveraged\nand also\nchange the\ncalculation of\nnumerous financial\nmetrics and\nmeasures of\nour\nperformance and\nfinancial condition.\nThese and\nfuture changes\nto accounting\nrules or\nregulations may\nadversely affect\nour reported\nresults of\noperations and\nfinancial position\nor perceptions\nof our\nperformance and financial condition.\nAdverse litigation matters may adversely affect\nour business and our financial condition.\nFrom time\nto time\nthe Company\nis involved\nin litigation\nand other\nclaims against\nour business.\nPrimarily these\narise from our\nnormal course of\nbusiness but\nare subject\nto risks\nand uncertainties,\nand\ncould require\nsignificant management time. The Company\u2019s periodic evaluation of litigation-\nrelated\nmatters may change our assessment in light of\nthe discovery of facts with respect to legal\nactions pending\nagainst us,\nnot presently known\nto us\nor by determination\nof judges, juries\nor other finders\nof fact.\nWe\nmay also be\nsubjected to legal matters\nnot yet known to\nus. Adverse decisions or\nsettlements of disputes\nmay negatively impact our business, reputation and financial condition.\nOur business operations subject us to legal compliance\nand litigation risks, as well as regulations and\nregulatory enforcement priorities, which could result in increased\ncosts or liabilities, divert our\nmanagement\u2019s\nattention or otherwise adversely affect our business, results\nof operations and financial\ncondition.\nOur operations are\nsubject to federal,\nstate and local\nlaws, rules and\nregulations, as well\nas U.S. and\nforeign laws\nand regulations\nrelating to\nour activities\nin foreign\ncountries from\nwhich we\nsource our\nmerchandise and operate\nour sourcing offices.\nOur business\nis also\nsubject to regulatory\nand litigation\nrisk in all\nof these jurisdictions, including\nforeign jurisdictions that\nmay lack well-established or\nreliable\nlegal systems\nfor resolving\nlegal disputes.\nCompliance risks\nand litigation\nclaims have\narisen and\nmay\ncontinue to\narise in\nthe ordinary\ncourse of\nour business\nand include,\namong other\nissues, intellectual\nproperty issues,\nemployment issues,\ncommercial disputes,\nproduct-oriented matters, tax,\ncustomer\nrelations and personal injury claims. International activities\nsubject us to numerous U.S. and international\nregulations, including but not limited to, restrictions on trade, license and permit requirements, import and\nexport license\nrequirements, privacy\nand data\nprotection laws,\nenvironmental laws,\nrecords and\ninformation management\nregulations, tariffs\nand taxes\nand anti-\ncorruption laws,\nsuch as\nthe Foreign\nCorrupt Practices Act, violations of\nwhich by employees or persons acting\non the Company\u2019s behalf\nmay\nresult in significant\ninvestigation costs, severe\ncriminal or civil\nsanctions and reputational\nharm.\nThese\nand other\nliabilities to\nwhich we may\nbe subject\ncould negatively affect\nour business,\noperating results\nand financial condition. These matters frequently raise complex factual and legal issues, which are subject\nto risks\nand uncertainties\nand could\ndivert significant\nmanagement time.\nThe Company\nmay also\nbe\nsubject to regulatory review\nand audits, which results\nmay have the\npotential to materially and\nadversely\naffect our\nbusiness, results of\noperations and financial\ncondition. In addition,\ngoverning laws, rules\nand\nregulations, and interpretations of existing laws are subject to change\nfrom time to time.\nCompliance and\nlitigation matters could\nresult in unexpected\nexpenses and liability,\nas well as\nhave an adverse\neffect on\nour operations and our reputation.\nNew legislation or regulation and interpretation of existing laws and regulations related to data privacy\ncould increase our costs of compliance, technology and business operations. The interpretation of existing\nor new laws to\nexisting technology and practices can be\nuncertain and may lead to\nadditional compliance\nrisk and cost.\nIf we fail to protect\nour trademarks and other\nintellectual property rights or infringe\nthe intellectual property\nrights of\nothers, our\nbusiness, brand\nimage, growth\nstrategy, results\nof operations\nand financial\ncondition\ncould be adversely affected.\nWe believe\nthat our\n\u201cCato\u201d, \u201cIt\u2019s\nFashion\u201d, \u201cIt\u2019s\nFashion Metro\u201d\nand \u201cVersona\u201d\ntrademarks are\nintegral to\nour store\ndesigns, brand\nrecognition and\nour ability\nto successfully\nbuild consumer\nloyalty.\nAlthough we have\nregistered these trademarks\nwith the U.S.\nPatent and Trademark\nOffice (\u201cPTO\u201d)\nand\nhave also registered, or applied for registration\nof, additional trademarks with the PTO that we believe are\nimportant to our\nbusiness, we cannot\ngive assurance that these\nregistrations will prevent\nimitation of our\ntrademarks, merchandising concepts, store designs or private label merchandise or the infringement\nof our\nother intellectual property rights by\nothers. Infringement of our names,\nconcepts, store designs or\nmerchandise generally,\nor particularly\nin a\nmanner that\nprojects lesser\nquality or\ncarries a\nnegative\nconnotation of our\nimage could adversely\naffect our\nbusiness, financial condition\nand results of\noperations.\nIn addition, we\ncannot give assurance that\nothers will not\ntry to block\nthe manufacture or\nsale of our\nprivate label merchandise by\nclaiming that our merchandise violates\ntheir trademarks or other proprietary\nrights. In\nthe event\nof such\na conflict,\nwe could\nbe subject\nto lawsuits\nor other\nactions, the\nultimate\nresolution of which\nwe cannot predict;\nhowever, such a\ncontroversy could adversely affect\nour business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nMaintaining and improving our internal control over financial\nreporting and other requirements necessary\nto operate as a public company may strain our resources, and\nany material failure in these controls may\nnegatively impact our business, the price of our common\nstock and market confidence in our reported\nfinancial information.\nAs a public\ncompany, we\nare subject to\nthe reporting requirements\nof the Securities\nExchange Act of\n1934, the Sarbanes\n-Oxley Act of\n2002, the rules\nof the SEC\nand New York\nStock Exchange and\ncertain\naspects of the Dodd-Frank Wall\nStreet Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) and\nrelated rule-making that has\nbeen and may continue\nto be implemented over\nthe next several years\nunder\nthe mandates of the Dodd-Frank Act. The requirements of\nthese rules and regulations have increased, and\nmay continue to increase,\nour compliance costs and place significant strain on our pe\nrsonnel, systems and\nresources. To\nsatisfy the\nSEC\u2019s rules\nimplementing the\nrequirements of\nSection 404\nof the\nSarbanes-\nOxley Act of\n2002, we must\ncontinue to document,\ntest, monitor and\nenhance our internal\ncontrol over\nfinancial reporting, which is a\ncostly and time-consuming effort that\nmust be re-evaluated frequently.\nWe\ncannot give assurance\nthat our disclosure\ncontrols and procedures\nand our internal\ncontrol over financial\nreporting, as defined by\napplicable SEC rules, will\nbe adequate in the\nfuture. Any failure\nto maintain the\neffectiveness of\ninternal control\nover financial\nreporting or\nto comply\nwith the\nother various\nlaws and\nregulations to which\nwe are and\nwill continue to\nbe subject, or\nto which we\nmay become subject\nin the\nfuture, as a public company\ncould have an adverse material impact\non our business, our financial\ncondition and the\nprice of our\ncommon stock. In\naddition, our efforts\nto comply with\nthese existing and\nnew requirements could significantly increase our compliance costs.\nRisks Relating to Our Investments and Liquidity:\nWe may experience\nmarket conditions or other events that could adversely\nimpact the valuation and liquidity\nof, and our ability to access, our short-term investments, cash and\ncash equivalents and our revolving line of\ncredit.\nOur short\n-term investments\nand cash\nequivalents are\nprimarily comprised of\ninvestments in\nfederal,\nstate, municipal and\ncorporate debt securities.\nThe value of\nthose securities may\nbe adversely impacted\nby factors relating to these securities, similar\nsecurities or the broader credit markets in general.\nMany of\nthese factors are beyond\nour control, and include\nbut are not\nlimited to changes\nto credit ratings, rates\nof\ndefault, collateral value,\ndiscount rates, and\nstrength and quality\nof market credit\nand liquidity,\npotential\ndisruptions in the capital markets\nand changes in the underlying economic,\nfinancial and other conditions\nthat drive these factors.\nAs federal, state and\nmunicipal entities struggle with declining\ntax revenues and\nbudget deficits, we\ncannot be assured\nof our ability\nto timely access\nthese investments if\nthe market for\nthese issues declines.\nSimilarly, the\ndefault by issuers of\nthe debt securities we\nhold or similar securities\ncould impair the liquidity of\nour investments.\nThe development or persistence of\nany of these conditions\ncould adversely\naffect our\nfinancial condition,\nresults of\noperations and\nability to\nexecute our\nbusiness\nstrategy. In\naddition, we\nhave significant amounts\nof cash\nand cash\nequivalents at\nfinancial institutions\nthat are\nin excess\nof the\nfederally insured\nlimits.\nAn economic\ndownturn or\ndevelopment of\nadverse\nconditions affecting the financial sector and stability\nof financial institutions could cause us to\nexperience\nlosses on our deposits.\nOur ability to\naccess credit markets\nand our revolving\nline of credit,\neither generally or\non favorable\nmarket terms, may be impacted\nby the factors discussed in\nthe preceding paragraph, as\nwell as continued\ncompliance with covenants under our\nrevolving credit agreement.\nThe development or persistence of\nany\nof these adverse\nfactors or failure to\ncomply with covenants on\nwhich our borrowing is\nconditioned may\nadversely affect\nour financial\ncondition, results\nof operation\ns\nand our\nability to\nexecute our\nbusiness\nstrategy.\nRisks Relating to the Market Value of Our Common Stock:\nOur operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly\nfluctuations, which could adversely affect the\nmarket price of our common stock.\nOur business varies\nwith general seasonal\ntrends that are\ncharacteristic of the\nretail apparel industry.\nAs a result,\nour stores typically\ngenerate a higher\npercentage of our\nannual net sales\nand profitability in\nthe first\nand second quarters\nof our\nfiscal year\ncompared to other\nquarters.\nAccordingly, our\noperating\nresults for any\none fiscal period\nare not necessarily\nindicative of\nresults to be\nexpected from any\nfuture\nperiod, and\nsuch seasonal\nand quarterly\nfluctuations could\nadversely affect\nthe marke\nt\nprice of\nour\ncommon stock.\nThe interests of a principal shareholder may limit the ability of\nother shareholders to influence the direction\nof the Company and otherwise affect our corporate\ngovernance.\nAs of March 29, 2021, John P. D. Cato, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, beneficially\ncontrolled approximately 48.1% of the voting power of\nour common stock.\nAs a result, Mr.\nCato may be\nable to control\nor significantly influence\nsubstantially\nall matters requiring\napproval by the\nshareholders,\nincluding the election\nof directors and\nthe approval of\nmergers and other\nbusiness combinations or other\nsignificant Company\ntransactions. Mr.\nCato may\nhave interests\nthat differ\nfrom those\nof other\nshareholders, and\nmay vote\nin a\nway with\nwhich other\nshareholders disagree\nor perceive\nas adverse\nto\ntheir interests.\nIn addition, the\nconcentration of voting power\nheld by Mr.\nCato could have\nthe effect of\npreventing, discouraging\nor deferring\na change\nin c\nontrol of\nthe Company,\nwhich could\ndepress the\nmarket price of our common stock. In the future, if Mr. Cato acquires beneficial control of more than 50%\nof the voting power of\nour common stock (including as\na result of continued Company stock\nrepurchases\nfrom time\nto time\nunder our\nstock repurchase\nprogram that\nwould reduce\nour outstanding\nshares), we\nwould qualify for\nexemption as a\n\u201ccontrolled company\u201d from\ncompliance with certain\nNew York\nStock\nExchange corporate governance rules, including the\nrequirements that we have a\nmajority of independent\ndirectors on\nour Board,\nan independent\ncompensation committee\nand an\nindependent corporate\ngovernance and\nnominating committee.\nIf we\nbecame eligible\nand elected\nto utilize\nthese \u201ccontrolled\ncompany\u201d exceptions, our other shareholders could lose\nthe benefit of these corporate governance\nrequirements and the market value of our common stock could be adversely\naffected.\nConditions in the stock market generally,\nor particularly relating to our industry, Company\nor common\nstock, may materially and adversely affect the market\nprice of our common stock and make its trading price\nmore volatile.\nThe trading price\nof our common\nstock at times\nhas been, and\nis likely to\ncontinue to be,\nsubject to\nsignificant volatility.\nA variety of factors\nmay cause the price of\nour common stock to\nfluctuate, perhaps\nsubstantially, including,\nbut not\nlimited to,\nthose discussed\nelsewhere in\nthis report,\nas well\nas the\nfollowing: low trading\nvolume; general market\nfluctuations resulting from\nfactors not directly\nrelated to\nour operations or the inherent value of our\ncommon stock; announcements of developments related to our\nbusiness; fluctuations in our reported operating results; general conditions or trends affecting or perceived\nto affect the\nfashion and retail industry;\nconditions or trends affecting\nor perceived to affect\nthe domestic\nor global economy\nor the domestic\nor global credit\nor capital markets;\nchanges in financial\nestimates or\nthe scope of\ncoverage given to\nour Company by\nsecurities analysts; n\negative commentary regarding\nour\nCompany and\ncorresponding short\n-selling market\nbehavior; adverse\ncustomer relations\ndevelopments;\nsignificant changes in\nour senior management\nteam; and legal\nproceedings.\nOver the past\nseveral years\nthe stock market in\ngeneral, and the market\nfor shares of equity\nsecurities of many retailers\nin particular,\nhave experienced\nextreme price\nfluctuations that\nhave at\ntimes been\nunrelated to\nthe operating\nperformance of those companies.\nSuch fluctuations and market\nvolatility based on these\nor other factors\nmay materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 11267, "SIC": 5621, "TIC": "CATO"}
