RISK FACTORS\nThe Corporation\u2019s business is subject to many risks and uncertainties. Although the Corporation seeks ways to manage these risks and develop programs to control those that management can control, the Corporation ultimately cannot predict the extent to which these risks and uncertainties could affect the Corporation's results. Actual results may differ materially from management's expectations. The following discussion sets forth what the Corporation currently believes could be the most significant factors of which it is currently aware that could affect the Corporation's business, results of operations or financial condition. You should consider all of the following risks together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nEconomic conditions may adversely affect the Corporation\u2019s financial performance.\nThe Corporation's businesses and results of operation are affected by the financial markets and general economic conditions in the United States, and particularly to adverse conditions in New York and Pennsylvania. Key economic factors affecting the Corporation include the level and volatility of short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation, home prices, unemployment and under-employment levels, bankruptcies, household income, consumer spending, fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets and currencies, liquidity of the financial markets, the availability and the cost of capital and credit, investor sentiment, confidence in the financial markets, and the sustainability of economic growth. The deterioration of any of these conditions could adversely affect the Corporation's consumer and commercial businesses, its securities and derivatives portfolios, its level of charge-offs and provision for credit losses, the carrying value of the Corporation's deferred tax assets, its capital levels, its capital levels and liquidity, and the Corporations results of operations.\nA decline or prolonged weakness in business and economic conditions generally or specifically in the principal markets in which the Corporation does business could have one or more of the following adverse effects on the Corporation\u2019s business: (i) a decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services; (ii) a decrease in the value of the Corporation\u2019s loans or other assets secured by consumer or commercial real estate; (iii) an impairment of certain of the Corporation\u2019s intangible assets, such as goodwill; and (iv) an increase in the number of borrowers and counter-parties who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to the Corporation. Additionally, in light of economic conditions, the Corporation\u2019s ability to assess the creditworthiness of its customers may be impaired if the models and approaches that it uses to select, manage and underwrite loans become less predictive of future behaviors. Further, competition in the Corporation\u2019s industry may intensify as a result of consolidation of financial services companies in response to market conditions and the Corporation may face increased regulatory scrutiny, which may increase its costs and limit its ability to pursue business opportunities.\nCommercial real estate and business loans increase the Corporation\u2019s exposure to credit risks.\nAt December 31, 2016, the Corporation\u2019s portfolio of commercial real estate and business loans totaled $745.2 million or 62.1% of total loans. The Corporation plans to continue to emphasize the origination of these types of loans, which generally expose the Corporation to a greater risk of nonpayment and loss than residential real estate or consumer loans because repayment of commercial real estate and business loans often depends on the successful operations and income stream of the borrower\u2019s business. Additionally, such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to residential real estate and consumer loans. Also, some of the Corporation\u2019s borrowers have more than one commercial loan outstanding. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose the Corporation to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to residential real estate and consumer loans. The Corporation targets its business lending and marketing strategy towards small to medium-sized businesses. These small to medium-sized businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities. If general economic conditions negatively impact these businesses, the Corporation\u2019s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nThe allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses in the loan portfolio.\nThe Corporation\u2019s customers may not repay their loans according to the original terms, and the collateral securing the payment of those loans may be insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance. Hence, the Corporation may experience significant loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's operating results. Management makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of its loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of its borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, management relies on loan quality reviews, past loss experience, and an evaluation of economic conditions, among other factors. If these assumptions prove to be incorrect, the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in the Corporation\u2019s loan portfolio, resulting in additions to the allowance. Material additions to the allowance would materially decrease net income.\nThe Corporation\u2019s emphasis on the origination of commercial loans is one of the more significant factors in evaluating its allowance for loan losses. As the Corporation continues to increase the amount of these loans, additional or increased provisions for loan losses may be necessary, which could result in a decrease in earnings.\nBank regulators periodically review the Corporation\u2019s allowance for loan losses and may require the Corporation to increase its provision for loan losses or loan charge-offs. Any increase in the allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's results of operations and/or financial condition.\nChanges in interest rates could adversely affect the Corporation\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Corporation\u2019s results of operations and financial condition are significantly affected by changes in interest rates. The Corporation's financial results depend substantially on net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income that it earns on interest-earning assets and the interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities. If the Corporation\u2019s interest-earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than its interest-bearing liabilities in a given period as a result of decreasing interest rates, net interest income may decrease. Likewise, net interest income may decrease if interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest-earning assets in a given period as a result of increasing interest rates. The Corporation has taken steps to mitigate this risk, such as holding fewer longer-term residential mortgages, as well as investing excess funds in shorter-term investments.\nChanges in interest rates also affect the fair value of the Corporation\u2019s interest-earning assets and, in particular, its investment securities available for sale. Generally, the fair value of investment securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates. Decreases in the fair value of investment securities available for sale, therefore, could have an adverse effect on its shareholders\u2019 equity or earnings if the decrease in fair value is deemed to be other than temporary.\nChanges in interest rates may also affect the average life of loans and mortgage-related securities. Decreases in interest rates can result in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-related securities, as borrowers refinance to reduce borrowing costs. Under these circumstances, the Corporation is subject to reinvestment risk to the extent that it is unable to reinvest the cash received from such prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates on its existing loans and securities. Additionally, increases in interest rates may decrease loan demand and make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable rate loans.\nMunicipal deposits are generally more sensitive to interest rates and may require competitive rates at placement and subsequent rollover dates, which may make it more difficult for the Bank to attract and retain public and municipal deposits. Additionally, when municipal deposits exceed FDIC coverage, any amounts not insured under the FDIC must be properly secured through a pledge of eligible securities. The requirement that the Bank collateralize municipal deposits above FDIC insurance may have an adverse effect on the Corporation's liquidity.\nStrong competition within the Corporation's industry and market area could limit its growth and profitability.\nThe Corporation faces substantial competition in all phases of its operations from a variety of different competitors. Future growth and success will depend on the ability to compete effectively in this highly competitive environment. The Corporation competes for deposits, loans and other financial services with a variety of banks, thrifts, credit unions and other financial institutions as well as other entities, which provide financial services. Some of the financial institutions and financial services organizations with which the Corporation competes with are not subject to the same degree of regulation as the Corporation. Many competitors have been in business for many years, have established customer bases, are larger, and have substantially higher lending limits. The financial services industry is also likely to become more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services. These technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds between parties.\nThe Corporation\u2019s growth strategy may not prove to be successful and its market value and profitability may suffer.\nAs part of the Corporation's strategy for continued growth, it may open additional branches. New branches do not initially contribute to operating profits due to the impact of overhead expenses and the start-up phase of generating loans and deposits. To the extent that additional branches are opened, the Corporation may experience the effects of higher operating expenses relative to operating income from the new operations, which may have an adverse effect on the Corporation's levels of net income, return on average equity and return on average assets.\nIn addition, the Corporation may acquire banks and related businesses that it believes provide a strategic fit with its business, such as the 2011 acquisition of FOFC and the 2013 acquisition of six branches from Bank of America. To the extent that the Corporation grows through acquisitions, it cannot provide assurance that such strategic decisions will be accretive to earnings.\nCompliance with the Dodd-Frank Act may increase the Corporation\u2019s costs of operations and adversely affect the Corporation\u2019s earnings and financial condition.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act represents a significant overhaul of many aspects of the regulation of the financial-services industry. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB, tightened capital standards, imposed clearing and margining requirements on many derivatives activities, and generally increases oversight and regulation of financial institutions and financial activities.\nIn addition to the self-implementing provisions of the statute, the Dodd-Frank Act calls for many administrative rulemakings by various federal agencies to implement various parts of the legislation. While regulators have adopted a number of new rules required by the Dodd-Frank Act, others have not been proposed or if proposed, not been adopted in final form. The Corporation cannot be certain when final rules affecting it will be issued through such rulemakings, and what the specific content of such rules will be. The financial reform legislation and any implementing rules that are ultimately issued could have adverse implications on the financial industry, the competitive environment, and the Corporation\u2019s ability to conduct business. The Corporation will have to apply resources to ensure that it is in compliance with all applicable provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and any implementing rules, which may increase the Corporation\u2019s costs of operations and adversely impact its earnings.\nThe Corporation operates in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations.\nCurrently, the Corporation and its subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation, supervision, and examination by regulatory authorities. For example, the FRB regulates the Corporation, the FRB, the FDIC and the NYSDFS regulate the Bank, and CRM is regulated by the Nevada Division of Insurance. Such regulators govern the activities in which the Corporation and its subsidiaries may engage. These regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on the operation of a bank, the classification of assets by a bank, and the adequacy of a bank\u2019s allowance for loan losses. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, or legislation, could have a material impact on the Corporation and its operations. The Corporation believes that it is in substantial compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations. As the Corporation's business is highly regulated, the laws, rules and applicable regulations are subject to regular modification and change. There can be no assurance that proposed laws, rules and regulations, or any other law, rule or regulation, will not be adopted in the future, which could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect the Corporation's business, financial condition or prospects.\nThe capital requirement changes from Basel III discussed in Item 1 - \u201cBusiness-Supervision and Regulation,\u201d could have a material adverse impact on the Corporation. Even though the Bank exceeds current and proposed minimum regulatory capital levels, adverse changes to residential mortgage risk weights, new requirements for common equity capital, inclusion of accumulated other comprehensive income in regulatory capital, the phase out of trust preferred securities, along with the adoption of new capital conservation buffers would reduce the Bank's current capital position and over time could cause the Bank to fail to meet minimum regulatory requirements. These capital positions are subject to volatility due to changes in interest rates and credit spreads. Although there is a phase-in period in the proposed rules, other factors such as the low interest rate environment, slow economic recovery, and further constraints on profitability by regulators could impact the Bank's ability to meet the new regulatory minimums once the phase-in periods have ended.\nChanges in tax rates could adversely affect the Corporation's results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Corporation is subject to the income tax laws of the United States, its states, and municipalities. The income tax laws of the jurisdictions in which the Corporation operates are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant government taxing authorities. In establishing a provision for income tax expense, the Corporation must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws to its business activities, as well as the timing of when certain items may affect taxable income.\nThe provision for income taxes is composed of current and deferred taxes. Deferred taxes arise from differences between assets and liabilities measured for financial reporting versus income tax return purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if, in the Corporation's judgment, their realizability is determined to be more likely than not. The Corporation performs regular reviews to ascertain the realizability of its deferred tax assets. These reviews include the Corporation's estimates and assumptions regarding future taxable income, which are incorporates various tax planning strategies. Changes in the Federal corporate tax rates, particularly rate reductions, can create a negative effect on the Corporation's reported earnings depending on the Corporation's then deferred tax position.\nThe Corporation is a holding company and depends on its subsidiaries for dividends, distributions and other payments.\nThe Corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank and other subsidiaries. Its principal source of cash flow, including cash flow to pay dividends to its shareholders, is dividends from the Bank. There are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends by the Bank to the Corporation, as well as by the Corporation to its shareholders. FRB regulations affect the ability of the Bank to pay dividends and other distributions and to make loans to the Corporation. If the Bank is unable to make dividend payments to the Corporation and sufficient capital is not otherwise available, it may not be able to make dividend payments to the Corporation's common shareholders.\nThe Corporation holds certain intangible assets that could be classified as impaired in the future. If these assets are considered to be either partially or fully impaired in the future, its earnings and the book values of these assets would decrease.\nThe Corporation is required to test its goodwill and core deposit intangible assets for impairment on a periodic basis. The impairment testing process considers a variety of factors, including the current market price of its common stock, the estimated net present value of its assets and liabilities, and information concerning the terminal valuation of similarly situated insured depository institutions. If an impairment determination is made in a future reporting period, its earnings and the book value of these intangible assets would be reduced by the amount of the impairment. If an impairment loss is recorded, it will have little or no impact on the tangible book value of the Corporation's common shares or its regulatory capital levels, but such an impairment loss could significantly restrict the Bank from paying a dividend to the Corporation.\nFinancial counterparties expose the Corporation to risks.\nThe Corporation has increased its use of derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps, which exposes it to financial and contractual risks with counterparty banks. The Corporation maintains correspondent bank relationships, manages certain loan participations, engages in securities transactions, and engages in other activities with financial counterparties that are customary to its industry. Financial risks are inherent in these counterparty relationships.\nThe Corporation may not be able to attract and retain skilled people.\nThe Corporation's success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key people. Competition for the best people in most activities in which the Corporation engages can be intense and it may not be able to hire people or to retain them. A key component of employee retention is providing a fair compensation base combined with the opportunity for additional compensation for above average performance. In this regard, the Corporation uses a stock-based compensation program that aligns the interest of the Corporation's executives and senior managers with the interests of the Corporation, and its shareholders.\nThe Corporation's compensation practices are designed to be competitive and comparable to those of its peers, however, the unexpected loss of services of one or more of the Corporation's key personnel could have a material adverse impact on the business because it would lose the employees\u2019 skills, knowledge of the market, and years of industry experience and may have difficulty promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.\nThe Corporation's controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented, which may result in a material adverse effect on its business.\nManagement regularly reviews and updates its internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met.\nThe Corporation continually encounters technological change and the failure to understand and adapt to these changes could adversely affect its business.\nThe banking industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. Technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for \"non-banks\" to offer traditional bank products and services using innovative technological platforms such as Fintech and Blockchain. These \"digital banks\" may be able to achieve economies of scale and offer better pricing for banking products and services than the Corporation can. The Corporation's future success will depend, in part, on the ability to address the needs of customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience as well as to create additional efficiencies in operations. Many competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. There can be no assurance that the Corporation will be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing such products and services to customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on the Corporation's business and, in turn, its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Corporation is subject to security and operational risks relating to its use of technology.\nDespite instituted safeguards, the Corporation cannot be certain that all of its systems are entirely free from vulnerability to attack or other technological difficulties or failures, such as cyber-attacks. The Corporation relies on the services of a variety of vendors to meet its data processing and communication needs. If information security is breached or other technology difficulties or failures occur, information may be lost or misappropriated, services and operations may be interrupted and the Corporation could be exposed to claims from customers. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nProvisions of the Corporation's certificate of incorporation, bylaws, as well as New York law and certain banking laws, could delay or prevent a takeover of the Corporation by a third party.\nProvisions of the Corporation\u2019s certificate of incorporation and bylaws, New York law, and state and federal banking laws, including regulatory approval requirements, could delay, defer or prevent a third party from acquiring the Corporation, despite the possible benefit to the Corporation\u2019s shareholders, or otherwise adversely affect the market price of the Corporation\u2019s common stock. These provisions include: a two-thirds affirmative vote of all outstanding shares of Corporation stock for certain business combinations; a supermajority shareholder vote of 75% of outstanding stock for business combinations involving 10% shareholders; the election of directors to staggered terms of three years; and advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the Corporation\u2019s Board of Directors and for proposing matters that shareholders may act on at a shareholder meeting. In addition, the Corporation is subject to New York law, which among other things prohibits the Corporation from engaging in a business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of five years from the date the person became an interested stockholder unless certain conditions are met. These provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts, discouraging bids for the Corporation\u2019s common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of, and the voting and other rights of the holders of the Corporation\u2019s common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors other than candidates nominated by the Board of Directors.\nThe risks presented by acquisitions could adversely affect the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations.\nThe business strategy of the Corporation has included and may continue to include growth through acquisition from time to time. Any future acquisitions will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions. These risks may include, among other things: its ability to realize anticipated cost savings, the difficulty of integrating operations and personnel, the loss of key employees, the potential disruption of its or the acquired company\u2019s ongoing business in such a way that could result in decreased revenues, the inability of its management to maximize its financial and strategic position, the inability to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, and the impairment of relationships with the acquired company\u2019s employees and customers as a result of changes in ownership and management.\nSevere weather and other natural disasters can affect the Corporation\u2019s business.\nThe Corporation's main office and its branch offices can be affected by natural disasters such as severe storms and flooding. These kinds of events could interrupt the Corporation's operations, particularly its ability to deliver deposit and other retail banking services to its customers and as a result, the Corporation's business could suffer serious harm. While the Corporation maintains adequate insurance against property and casualty losses arising from most natural disasters, and it has successfully overcome the challenges caused by past flooding in Central New York, there can be no assurance that it will be as successful if and when disasters occur.\nThe Corporation's accounting policies and estimates are critical to how the Corporation reports its financial condition and results of operations, and any changes to such accounting policies and estimates could materially affect how the Corporation reports its financial condition and results of operations.\nManagement has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require management\u2019s judgment to ascertain the valuations of assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies. A variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset, valuing an asset or liability or reducing a liability. The Corporation has established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure that these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently. In addition, these policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. Because of the uncertainty surrounding its judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters, actual outcomes may be materially different from amounts previously estimated. For example, because of the inherent uncertainty of estimates, management cannot provide any assurance that the Bank will not significantly increase its allowance for loan losses if actual losses are more than the amount reserved. Any increase in its allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation's financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the Corporation cannot guarantee that it will not be required to adjust accounting policies or restate prior financial statements.\nFurther, from time to time, the FASB and SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Corporation's financial statements. The ongoing economic recession has resulted in increased scrutiny of accounting standards by legislators and the Corporation's regulators, particularly as they relate to fair value accounting principles. In addition, ongoing efforts to achieve convergence between GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards may result in changes to GAAP. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how it records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, the Corporation could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in its restating prior period financial statements or otherwise adversely affecting its financial condition or results of operations.\nSpecifically, in June of 2016, FASB issued a new accounting standard, ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) that will substantially change the accounting for credit losses under GAAP. Under GAAP's current standards, credit losses are not reflected in the Corporation's financial statements until it is probable that the credit losses has been incurred. This methodology has the effect of delaying the recognition of credit losses on loans. Under the new credit loss standard, the allowance for credit losses will be an estimate of the \"expected\" credit losses on loans. The new credit loss standard may have a negative impact on the reporting of results of operations and financial condition of the Corporation. The amendments in this ASU are effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, though entities may adopt the amendments earlier for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018.\nThere may be claims and litigation pertaining to fiduciary responsibility.\nFrom time to time as part of the Corporation\u2019s normal course of business, customers make claims and take legal action against the Corporation based on its actions or inactions related to the fiduciary responsibilities of the Wealth Management Group segment. If such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to the Corporation, they may result in financial liability and/or adversely affect the market perception of the Corporation and its products and services. This may also impact customer demand for the Corporation\u2019s products and services. Any financial liability or reputation damage could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation\u2019s business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 13694, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "CHMG"}
