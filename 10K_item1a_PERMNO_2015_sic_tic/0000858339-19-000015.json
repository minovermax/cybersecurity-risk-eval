{"cik": "858339", "company": "CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-22", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur substantial indebtedness and the fact that a significant portion of our cash flow is used to make interest payments and rent payments under the Lease Agreements (defined below) could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us from making debt service payments and rent payments.\nCaesars Entertainment is a highly-leveraged company and had $9.1 billion in debt outstanding under credit facilities and notes (including our convertible notes) as of December 31, 2018. As a result, a significant portion of our liquidity needs are for debt service on such indebtedness, including significant interest payments. Our estimated debt service (including principal and interest) on our credit facilities and notes (including our convertible notes) is $644 million for 2019 and $11.3 billion thereafter to maturity for our currently outstanding indebtedness under our credit facilities and notes (including our convertible notes).\nSee Note 12 for details of our debt outstanding and related restrictive covenants.\nOur substantial indebtedness and the restrictive covenants under the agreements governing such indebtedness could:\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow money for our working capital, capital expenditures, development projects, debt service requirements, rent payment requirements, strategic initiatives or other purposes;\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and the Lease Agreements, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments or Lease Agreements, including restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions, could result in an event of default under the agreements governing our indebtedness or such Lease Agreements;\n\u2022\nrequire that a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations be dedicated to the payment of rent and interest and repayment of our indebtedness, thereby reducing funds available to us for other purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our operations or business;\n\u2022\nmake us more highly-leveraged than certain of our competitors, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage;\n\u2022\nmake us more vulnerable to downturns in our business or the economy;\n\u2022\nrestrict the availability for us to make strategic acquisitions, develop new gaming facilities, introduce new technologies or exploit business opportunities;\n\u2022\naffect our ability to renew certain gaming and other licenses;\n\u2022\nlimit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness and the Lease Agreements, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds or dispose of assets; and\n\u2022\nexpose us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest.\nAny of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects and ability to satisfy our outstanding debt obligations and lease obligations.\nOur ability to satisfy our debt obligations and lease obligations will depend upon, among other things:\n\u2022\nour future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control; and\n\u2022\nour future ability to borrow under our credit facilities, the availability of which depends on, among other things, our complying with the covenants thereunder.\nOur debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nOur debt agreements contain, and the agreements governing any future indebtedness of ours would likely contain, a number of covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions, including restrictions on our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt or issue certain preferred shares;\n\u2022\npay dividends on or make distributions in respect of our capital stock or make other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments;\n\u2022\nsell certain assets;\n\u2022\ncreate liens on certain assets;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with our affiliates; and\n\u2022\ndesignate our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.\nAs a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs.\nWe have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under our subsidiaries\u2019 secured debt agreements. If any of our lenders accelerate the repayment of borrowings, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay our indebtedness.\nWe are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios under the agreements governing our revolving credit facilities if and when specified amounts are drawn and outstanding under our revolving credit facilities. See Note 12 for further information. Our ability to meet the financial ratios under our debt agreements can be affected by events beyond our control, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to meet those ratios.\nA failure to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements that govern our indebtedness could result in an event of default thereunder, which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In the event of any default under the indebtedness of CEC, CRC or CEOC LLC, the lenders or noteholders thereunder:\n\u2022\nwill not be required to lend any additional amounts to such borrowers;\n\u2022\ncould elect to declare all indebtedness outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit; or\n\u2022\nrequire such borrowers to apply all of our available cash to repay such indebtedness.\nSuch actions by the lenders or noteholders under CEC\u2019s, CRC\u2019s or CEOC LLC\u2019s indebtedness could cause cross defaults under the other indebtedness of CEC, CRC or CEOC LLC, respectively, and in the case of lenders or noteholders under CRC\u2019s or CEOC LLC\u2019s indebtedness, could cause additional cross defaults under CEC\u2019s indebtedness. If we are unable to repay amounts under our secured credit facilities, the lenders under such secured credit facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness.\nIf the indebtedness under CEC\u2019s, CRC\u2019s or CEOC LLC\u2019s credit facilities or other indebtedness were to be accelerated, there can be no assurance that their assets would be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full.\nCEC, CEOC LLC, CRC and/or their respective subsidiaries are parties to certain leasing and related arrangements that may have a negative effect on CEC\u2019s business and operations.\nCEC, CEOC LLC, CRC, and certain of their subsidiaries are parties to certain leasing and financial commitments, including three lease agreements relating to properties operated by CEOC LLC or its subsidiaries (the \u201cCEOC LLC Lease Agreements\u201d), three related management and lease support agreements, a lease agreement relating to a property operated by a subsidiary of CRC (the \u201cHLV Lease Agreement\u201d and collectively with the CEOC LLC Lease Agreements, the \u201cLease Agreements\u201d) and related guaranties (collectively, the \u201cLease Documents\u201d). Pursuant to the CEOC LLC Lease Agreements, VICI leases properties to CEOC LLC (or the applicable subsidiaries of CEOC LLC) and CEOC LLC (or the applicable subsidiaries of CEOC LLC) is responsible for lease payments and other obligations for: (i) Caesars Palace Las Vegas; (ii) substantially all domestic properties owned by CEOC LLC and its subsidiaries other than Caesars Palace Las Vegas; and (iii) Harrah\u2019s Joliet Hotel & Casino in Joliet, Illinois. CEC guarantees the payment and performance of all monetary obligations of CEOC LLC and its subsidiaries under the CEOC LLC Lease Agreements. Pursuant to the HLV Lease Agreement, VICI leases Harrah\u2019s Las Vegas to a subsidiary of CRC, which is responsible for lease payments and other obligations for Harrah\u2019s Las Vegas. CRC guarantees the payment and performance of all monetary obligations of its subsidiary under the HLV Lease Agreement.\nCEC has entered into call right agreements with VICI pursuant to which VICI has the right for five years from October 6, 2017, the date of those agreements, to purchase and lease to CEC or one of its subsidiaries interests in the real property assets associated with Harrah\u2019s Laughlin, Harrah\u2019s Atlantic City and Harrah\u2019s New Orleans, which could also impose additional lease payments and other obligations on CEC and its subsidiaries. CEC and VICI also entered into a right of first refusal agreement that provides, among other things, for (a) a grant by CEC (on behalf of itself and all of its majority owned subsidiaries) to VICI (on behalf of itself and all of its majority owned subsidiaries) of a right of first refusal to own and lease to an affiliate of CEC certain non-Las Vegas domestic real estate that CEC or its affiliates may have the opportunity to acquire or develop and (b) a grant by VICI to CEC of a right of first refusal to lease and manage certain non-Las Vegas domestic real estate that VICI may have the opportunity to acquire or develop.\nPursuant to the Lease Agreements, as amended in December 2018, CEC\u2019s subsidiaries are obligated to pay, in the aggregate, approximately $782 million in fixed annual rents, subject to certain escalators and adjustments beginning at various points in the initial term and continuing through the renewal terms. If CEC\u2019s businesses and properties fail to generate sufficient earnings, the payments required to service these leasing commitments may materially and adversely limit the ability of CEC to make investments to maintain and grow its portfolio of businesses and properties. Additionally, CEC may be subject to other significant obligations under its guarantees if its subsidiaries are unable to satisfy their lease payments and other monetary obligations which could materially and adversely affect CEC\u2019s business and operating results.\nCEC\u2019s guarantees of the CEOC LLC Lease Agreements impose restrictions on certain business activities of CEC, including restrictions on sales of assets and making dividends and distributions. The Lease Documents generally impose restrictions on the business activities of CEOC LLC, CRC and their applicable subsidiaries, including restrictions on transfers of the leased properties, requirements to make specified minimum levels of capital expenditures and limitations regarding how the leased properties may be operated. Compliance with the restrictions in the Lease Documents may constrain the ability of CEC to implement any growth plans as well as its flexibility to react and adapt to unexpected operational challenges and adverse changes in economic and legal conditions. Additionally, with respect to properties leased pursuant to the Lease Agreements, CEOC LLC or CRC (or their applicable subsidiaries) generally will be required to restore properties that are damaged by casualties regardless of whether any insurance proceeds are sufficient to pay for the restoration.\nEach of CEOC LLC, CRC and/or their respective subsidiaries are required to pay a significant portion of their cash flow from operations to VICI pursuant to and subject to the terms and conditions of the Lease Agreements, which could adversely affect our ability to fund our operations or development projects, raise capital, make acquisitions, and otherwise respond to competitive and economic changes.\nEach of CEOC LLC, CRC and/or their applicable subsidiaries are required to pay a significant portion of their cash flow from operations to VICI pursuant to and subject to the terms and conditions of the Lease Agreements. As a result of this commitment, their ability to fund their own operations or development projects, raise capital, make acquisitions and otherwise respond to competitive and economic changes may be adversely affected. For example, their obligations under the Lease Agreements may:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for the applicable entity to satisfy their obligations with respect to their indebtedness and to obtain additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nincrease the applicable entity\u2019s vulnerability to general or regional adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in its business;\n\u2022\nrequire the applicable entity to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to making lease payments, thereby reducing the availability of its cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit the applicable entity\u2019s flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and the industry in which it operates; and\n\u2022\nrestrict the applicable entity\u2019s ability to raise capital, make acquisitions and divestitures and engage in other significant transactions.\nIn addition, the annual rent escalations under the Lease Agreements will continue to apply regardless of the amount of cash flows generated by the properties that are subject to the Lease Agreements (subject to certain EBITDAR to rent ratio-based caps). Accordingly, if the cash flows generated by such properties decrease, or do not increase at the same rate as the rent escalations, the rents payable under the Lease Agreements could comprise a higher percentage of the cash flows generated by the applicable entity, which could exacerbate, perhaps materially, the issues described above.\nAny of the above listed factors could have a material adverse effect on CEOC LLC\u2019s and CRC\u2019s respective business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe CEC Convertible Notes are exercisable for shares of our common stock. The exercise of such equity instruments would have a dilutive effect to stockholders of CEC.\nThe $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.00% convertible senior notes maturing in 2024 (the \u201cCEC Convertible Notes\u201d) are exercisable for shares of our common stock. The exercise of such equity instruments would have a dilutive effect to stockholders of CEC. In accordance with the terms of the Plan, on the Effective Date, we issued approximately $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of CEC Convertible Notes that are convertible at the option of holders into a number of shares of our common stock that is initially equal to 0.139 shares of our common stock per $1.00 principal amount of CEC Convertible Notes, or approximately 156 million shares, of which 151 million shares are net of amounts held by CEC. If all the shares were issued on the Effective Date, they would have represented approximately 17.9% of the shares of our common stock outstanding after giving effect to the shares issued in accordance with the Plan. The CEC Convertibles Notes are subject to conversion at our option beginning in October 2020 if the last reported sale price of our common stock equals or exceeds 140% of the conversion price for the CEC Convertible Notes in effect on each of at least 20 trading days during any 30 consecutive trading day period. CEC does not have any other redemption rights for the CEC Convertible Notes. As of December 31, 2018, the remaining life of the CEC Convertible Notes is 5.75 years.\nMost of CEOC LLC\u2019s U.S. gaming facilities, as well as Harrah\u2019s Las Vegas, are leased and could experience risks associated with leased property, including risks relating to lease termination, lease extensions, consents and approvals, charges and our relationship with VICI, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations.\nMost of CEOC LLC\u2019s U.S. gaming facilities are leased and could experience risks associated with leased property, including risks relating to lease termination, lease extensions, consents and approvals, charges and our relationship with VICI, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, or results of operations. CEOC LLC and its subsidiaries lease most of the gaming facilities they operate pursuant to the CEOC LLC Lease Agreements. Termination of any or all of the CEOC LLC Lease Agreements would result in CEOC LLC or its applicable subsidiaries losing some or all of their rights with respect to the applicable properties, could result in a default under CEOC LLC\u2019s debt agreements, and could have a material adverse effect on CEOC LLC\u2019s business, financial position, or results of operations. In the event of certain terminations of the CEOC LLC Lease Agreements, CEOC LLC or its applicable subsidiaries may be required to cooperate to transfer all personal property located at the applicable facility to a designated successor. Moreover, since as a lessee CEOC LLC and its subsidiaries do not completely control the land and improvements underlying their operations, VICI, as lessor, could take certain actions to disrupt CEOC LLC and its subsidiaries\u2019 rights in the facilities leased under the CEOC LLC Lease Agreements, which are beyond our control. If VICI chose to disrupt CEOC LLC and its subsidiaries\u2019 use either permanently or for a significant period of time, then the value of their assets could be impaired and their business and operations could be adversely affected. There can also be no assurance that CEOC LLC and its subsidiaries will be able to comply with their obligations under the CEOC LLC Lease Agreements in the future. In addition, if VICI has financial, operational, regulatory or other challenges there can be no assurance that VICI will be able to comply with its obligations under its agreements with CEC, CEOC LLC, or their subsidiaries.\nCRC\u2019s subsidiary leases Harrah\u2019s Las Vegas from VICI pursuant to the HLV Lease Agreement on terms that are similar to those of the CEOC LLC Lease Agreements. CRC and its subsidiary, therefore, are subject to many of the same risks described above with respect to Harrah\u2019s Las Vegas.\nThe Lease Agreements are a type of lease that is commonly known as a triple net lease. Accordingly, in addition to rent, the tenants under the Lease Agreements are required to pay all operating costs associated with the respective facilities, including the payment of taxes, insurance, and all repairs, and providing indemnities to VICI against liabilities associated with the operations of each facility. CEC\u2019s applicable subsidiaries are responsible for incurring the costs described in the preceding sentence notwithstanding the fact that many of the benefits received in exchange for such costs may in part accrue to VICI as owner of the associated facilities. In addition, if some of the leased facilities should prove to be unprofitable, CEOC LLC and its subsidiaries or CRC\u2019s subsidiary, as applicable, could remain obligated for lease payments and other obligations under the Lease Agreements even if they decided to withdraw from those locations, and consequently, CEC and CRC would remain obligated under the corresponding lease guarantees. CEOC LLC and its subsidiaries or CRC\u2019s subsidiary, as applicable, could incur special charges relating to the closing of such facilities including lease termination costs, impairment charges, and other special charges that would reduce their net income and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and lease commitments, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness and lease commitments that may not be successful.\nWe may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or may be unable to draw under our credit facilities or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to fund our liquidity needs. Our operating cash inflows are typically used for operating expenses, debt service costs, lease payments, working capital needs, and capital expenditures in the normal course of business. Our estimated debt service (including principal and interest) is $644 million for 2019 and $11.3 billion thereafter to maturity for our outstanding indebtedness and our estimated financing obligations are $753 million for 2019 and $37.7 billion thereafter to maturity for our outstanding lease arrangements. If we are unable to service our debt obligations or pay our financing obligations, there can be no assurances that our business will continue in its current state. See Note 12 for details of our debt outstanding and Note 10 for details of our lease commitments.\nWe may incur additional indebtedness and lease commitments, which could adversely affect our ability to pursue certain business opportunities.\nWe and our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness and lease commitments at any time and from time to time in the future. Although the terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness and lease commitments contain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness and certain types of lease commitments, these restrictions are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions, and the indebtedness and lease commitments incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. For example, as of December 31, 2018, CRC had $864 million of additional borrowing capacity available under its senior secured credit facility, net of $100 million outstanding and $36 million committed to outstanding letters of credit, and CEOC LLC had a total of $161 million of additional borrowing capacity available under its senior secured credit facility, net of $39 million committed to outstanding letters of credit. We may consider incurring additional indebtedness in the future to fund our growth strategy.\nOur subsidiary debt agreements allow for limited future issuances of additional secured or unsecured indebtedness, which may include, in each case, indebtedness secured on a pari passu basis with the obligations under CRC\u2019s or CEOC LLC\u2019s credit facilities. This indebtedness could be used for a variety of purposes, including financing capital expenditures, refinancing or repurchasing our outstanding indebtedness, including existing unsecured indebtedness, or for general corporate purposes. We have raised and expect to continue to raise debt, including secured debt, to directly or indirectly refinance our outstanding unsecured debt on an opportunistic basis, as well as development and acquisition opportunities. Additional indebtedness would require greater servicing payments, and accordingly, may affect our future liquidity and limit our ability to pursue certain opportunities and implement any growth plans in the future.\nRepayment of our and our subsidiaries\u2019 debt is dependent on cash flow generated by our subsidiaries.\nOur subsidiaries currently own a significant portion of our assets and conduct a significant portion of our operations. Accordingly, repayment of our and our subsidiaries\u2019 indebtedness is dependent, to a significant extent, on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and, in the case of CEC\u2019s debt, their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend, if needed, or otherwise. Our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on our other subsidiaries\u2019 indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose (other than with respect to subsidiary guarantees granted by certain subsidiaries of CEOC LLC to guarantee CEOC LLC\u2019s indebtedness and by certain subsidiaries of CRC to guarantee CRC\u2019s indebtedness). Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our or our other subsidiaries\u2019 indebtedness. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries.\nOur business and results of operations could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of activist stockholders, which could impact our stock price.\nWe have been the subject of actions taken by activist stockholders. For instance, on February 19, 2019, Carl C. Icahn and various affiliated entities (collectively, \u201cIcahn\u201d) filed with the SEC a Schedule 13D indicating that Icahn beneficially owns 9.8 percent of our common stock. The Schedule 13D disclosed that Icahn had spoken to, and intended to continue to speak with, our Board of Directors and management regarding enhancing shareholder value, improving asset optimization and seeking board representation, including, if necessary, by nominating a slate of directors at the 2019 Annual Meeting. The Schedule 13D also indicated that Icahn believes the Board of Directors should conduct a strategic process to comprehensively assess the best path forward for our company and Icahn\u2019s belief that stockholder value might be best served, and enhanced, by selling our Company.\nWhile we strive to maintain constructive, ongoing communications with all of our stockholders, and welcome their views and opinions with the goal of enhancing value for all stockholders, activist stockholders may, from time to time, engage in proxy solicitations or advance stockholder proposals, or otherwise attempt to effect changes and assert influence on our Board of Directors\nand management. Responding to proposals by activist stockholders may, and responding to a proxy contest instituted by stockholders would, require us to incur significant legal and advisory fees, proxy solicitation expenses (in the case of a proxy contest) and administrative and associated costs and require significant time and attention by our Board of Directors and management, diverting their attention from the pursuit of our business strategy. Any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction and control, our ability to execute on our strategy or changes to the composition of our Board of Directors or senior management team arising from proposals by activist stockholders or a proxy contest could lead to the perception of a change in the direction of our business or instability which may be exploited by our competitors, result in the loss of potential business opportunities and make it more difficult to pursue our strategic initiatives or attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. In addition, stockholder activism and potential resulting changes in governance may have implications under the various gaming laws to which we are subject, and could have an adverse impact on our gaming licenses. We may choose to initiate, or may become subject to, litigation as a result of proposals by activist stockholders or proxy contests or matters relating thereto, which would serve as a further distraction to our Board of Directors and management and could require us to incur significant additional costs.\nIn addition, actions such as those described above could cause significant fluctuations in the trading prices of our common stock, based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.\nAs we continue to engage in discussions with Icahn, the trading prices of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations, including as a result of actions taken by activist stockholders and our responses thereto, which may be material.\nLikewise, to the extent that we implement any proposals made by Icahn or any other activist stockholder to change the composition of our Board of Directors, engage in particular transactions or change certain aspects of our strategy, the resulting changes in our business, assets, results of operations and financial condition may be material and may have an impact, which may be material, on the market prices of our common stock, and may also cause substantial volatility in the trading price of those securities.\nWe may not realize any or all of our anticipated value creation opportunities, which would have a negative effect on our results of operations.\nAs part of our enterprise-wide strategy, we have implemented a program of continuous improvement designed to identify value creation opportunities to improve operations and results, including without limitation through identifying opportunities to improve profitability by reducing costs. Any cost savings or other value creation that we ultimately realize from such efforts may differ materially from originally anticipated amounts or be offset by other unanticipated developments. These plans are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that may change at any time. We cannot assure you that cost-savings or other value creation initiatives will be completed as anticipated or that the benefits we expect will be achieved on a timely basis or at all.\nIt is unclear what long-term impact our business structure will have on our key business relationships and our ability to compete with other gaming operators.\nAs a result of the consummation of the Plan, we are among a few gaming operators that lease a significant portion of its properties from a single lessor under lease arrangements. As a result, it is difficult to predict whether and to what extent our relationship with VICI, including any actual or perceived conflicts of interest, will affect our relationships with suppliers, customers, or regulators or our ability to compete with other gaming operators that are not subject to a master lease arrangement with a single lessor. In addition, VICI has numerous consent, audit, and other rights under the Lease Documents. As a result, a number of CEOC LLC\u2019s and CRC\u2019s strategic and operational decisions are subject to review and/or agreement with VICI, and there can be no assurance that VICI\u2019s exercise of its rights under the Lease Documents will not be adverse to CEOC LLC\u2019s or CRC\u2019s business or operations, particularly where our interests and the interests of VICI (or those who control it) are not aligned.\nThe development and construction of new hotels, casinos, and gaming and non-gaming venues and the expansion of existing ones could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations due to various factors including delays, cost overruns, and other uncertainties.\nWe intend to develop, construct, and open new hotels, casinos, and other gaming venues and develop and manage non-gaming venues in response to opportunities that may arise. Future development projects may require significant capital commitments, the incurrence of additional debt, guarantees of third-party debt, the incurrence of contingent liabilities and an increase in depreciation and amortization expense, which could have an adverse effect upon our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow. The development and construction of new hotels, casinos and gaming venues and the expansion of existing ones is susceptible to various risks and uncertainties, such as:\n\u2022\nthe existence of acceptable market conditions and demand for the completed project;\n\u2022\ngeneral construction risks, including cost overruns, change orders and plan or specification modification, shortages of construction resources, labor disputes, unforeseen environmental, engineering or geological problems, work stoppages, fire and other natural disasters, construction scheduling problems, and weather interferences;\n\u2022\nchanges and concessions required by governmental or regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nthe ability to finance the projects, especially in light of our substantial indebtedness;\n\u2022\ndelays in obtaining, or inability to obtain, all licenses, permits and authorizations required to complete and/or operate the project; and\n\u2022\ndisruption of our existing operations and facilities.\nMoreover, our development and expansion projects are sometimes jointly pursued with third parties or by licensing our brands to third parties. These joint development, expansion project, or license agreements are subject to risks, in addition to those disclosed above, as they are dependent on our ability to reach and maintain agreements with third parties.\nOur failure to complete any new development or expansion project, or complete any joint development or expansion projects or projects where we license our brands, as planned, on schedule, within budget, or in a manner that generates anticipated profits, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow.\nWe may pursue strategic acquisitions of third-party assets and businesses as a complement to our future growth strategy, which could raise material investment risk and affect our businesses and operations, if integration is unsuccessful or the acquired assets and businesses perform poorly.\nWe intend to implement a growth plan centered on an organic growth strategy for our non-gaming entertainment, hospitality, and leisure offerings. We also intend to pursue strategic acquisitions as a complement to the extent such acquisitions present attractive opportunities that would bolster our organic growth strategy. Additionally, we will also look to become a more active participant in certain high-growth sports and mobile gaming opportunities in order to leverage our extensive experience and management expertise in the gaming industry and build an enhanced high-growth portfolio.\nOur ability to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions will depend, in part, on our ability to integrate the acquired businesses with our businesses. The combination of two independent companies is a complex, costly, and time-consuming process. This process may disrupt the business of either or both of the companies and may not result in the full benefits expected. The difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include, among other things:\n\u2022\ncoordinating marketing functions;\n\u2022\nundisclosed liabilities;\n\u2022\nunanticipated issues in integrating information, communications and other systems;\n\u2022\nunanticipated incompatibility of purchasing, logistics, marketing, and administration methods;\n\u2022\nretaining key employees;\n\u2022\nconsolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns; and\n\u2022\ncoordinating geographically separate organizations.\nAdditionally, even if integration is successful, the overall integration of acquired assets and businesses may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, loss of customer and other business relationships and diversion of management attention. There is also no guarantee that the acquired assets or businesses will generate any of the projected synergies and earnings growth, and the failure to realize such projected synergies and earnings growth may adversely affect our operating and financial results and derail any growth plans.\nThe risks associated with our existing and potential future international operations could reduce our profits.\nSome of our properties are located outside the United States, and we are currently pursuing additional international opportunities. International operations are subject to inherent risks including:\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability;\n\u2022\nvariation in local economies;\n\u2022\ncurrency fluctuation;\n\u2022\ngreater difficulty in accounts receivable collection;\n\u2022\ntrade barriers; and\n\u2022\nburden of complying with a variety of international laws.\nWe are or may become involved in legal proceedings that, if adversely adjudicated or settled, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nFrom time to time, we are a defendant in various lawsuits or other legal proceedings relating to matters incidental to our business. Some of these matters involve commercial or contractual disputes, intellectual property claims, legal compliance, personal injury claims, and employment claims. As with all legal proceedings, no assurance can be provided as to the outcome of these matters and, in general, legal proceedings can be expensive and time consuming. We may not be successful in the defense or prosecution of these lawsuits, which could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nCompromises of our information systems or unauthorized access to confidential information or our customers\u2019 personal information could materially harm our reputation and business.\nWe collect and store confidential, personal information relating to our customers for various business purposes, including marketing and financial purposes, and credit card information for processing payments. For example, we handle, collect and store personal information in connection with our customers staying at our hotels and enrolling in Caesars Rewards. We may share this personal and confidential information with vendors or other third parties in connection with processing of transactions, operating certain aspects of our business, or for marketing purposes. Our collection and use of personal data are governed by state and federal privacy laws and regulations as well as the applicable laws and regulations in other countries in which we operate. Privacy law is subject to frequent changes and varies significantly by jurisdiction. We may incur significant costs in order to ensure compliance with the various applicable privacy requirements. In addition, privacy laws and regulations may limit our ability to market to our customers.\nWe assess and monitor the security of collection, storage, and transmission of customer information on an ongoing basis. We utilize commercially available software and technologies to monitor, assess and secure our network. Further, some of the systems currently used for transmission and approval of payment card transactions and the technology utilized in payment cards themselves, all of which can put payment card data at risk, are determined and controlled by the payment card industry, and other such systems are determined and controlled by us. Although we have taken steps designed to safeguard our customers\u2019 confidential personal information and important internal company data, our network and other systems and those of third parties, such as service providers, could be compromised, damaged, or disrupted by a third-party breach of our system security or that of a third-party provider or as a result of purposeful or accidental actions of third parties, our employees, or those employees of a third party, power outages, computer viruses, system failures, natural disasters, or other catastrophic events. Our third-party information system service providers face risks relating to cybersecurity similar to ours, and we do not directly control any of such parties\u2019 information security operations. Advances in computer and software capabilities, encryption technology, new tools, and other developments may increase the risk of a security breach. As a result of any security breach, customer information or other proprietary data may be accessed or transmitted by or to a third party. Despite the measures we have implemented to safeguard our information, there can be no assurance that we are adequately protecting our information.\nAny loss, disclosure of, misappropriation of, or access to customers\u2019 or other proprietary information or other breach of our information security could result in legal claims or legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations and actions, or liability for failure to comply with privacy and information security laws, including for failure to protect personal information or for misusing personal information, which could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and expose us to claims from customers, financial institutions, regulators, payment card associations, employees, and other persons, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow.\nWe have cybersecurity insurance to respond to a breach which is designed to cover expenses around notification, credit monitoring, investigation, crisis management, public relations and legal advice. We also carry other insurance which may cover ancillary\naspects of the event. However, damage and claims arising from a breach may not be completely covered or may exceed the amount of any insurance available.\nOur reliance on our computer systems and software could expose us to great financial harm if any of our computer systems or software were subject to any material disruption or corruption.\nWe rely significantly on our computer systems and software to receive and properly process internal and external data, including data related to Caesars Rewards. A disruption or corruption of the proper functioning of our computer systems or software could cause us to lose data or record erroneous data, which could result in material losses. We cannot guarantee that our efforts to maintain competitive computer systems and software will be successful. Our computer systems and software may fail or be subject to bugs or other errors, resulting in service interruptions or other unintended consequences. If any of these risks materialize, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may sell or divest different properties or assets as a result of our evaluation of our portfolio of businesses. Such sales or divestitures could affect our costs, revenues, profitability, and financial position.\nFrom time to time, we evaluate our properties and our portfolio of businesses and may, as a result, sell or attempt to sell, divest, or spin-off different properties or assets (subject to any restrictions in the agreements governing our indebtedness and leases). These sales or divestitures affect our costs, revenues, profitability, financial position, liquidity, and our ability to comply with our debt covenants. Divestitures have inherent risks, including possible delays in closing transactions (including potential difficulties in obtaining regulatory approvals), the risk of lower-than-expected sales proceeds for the divested businesses, and potential post-closing claims for indemnification. In addition, current economic conditions and relatively illiquid real estate markets may result in fewer potential bidders and unsuccessful sales efforts. Expected costs savings, which are offset by revenue losses from divested properties, may also be difficult to achieve or maximize due to our fixed cost structure.\nReduction in discretionary consumer spending resulting from a downturn in the national economy, the volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets, adverse changes in the global economy, and other factors could negatively impact our financial performance and our ability to access financing.\nChanges in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences are driven by factors beyond our control, such as perceived or actual general economic conditions; high energy, fuel and other commodity costs; the cost of travel; the potential for bank failures; a soft job market; an actual or perceived decrease in disposable consumer income and wealth; increases in payroll taxes; increases in gaming taxes or fees; fears of recession and changes in consumer confidence in the economy; and terrorist attacks or other global events. Our business is susceptible to any such changes because our properties offer a highly-discretionary set of entertainment and leisure activities and amenities. Gaming and other leisure activities we offer represent discretionary expenditures and participation in such activities may decline if discretionary consumer spending declines, including during economic downturns, during which consumers generally earn less disposable income. Particularly, we have business concentrations in gaming offerings and in Las Vegas, which are sensitive to declines in discretionary consumer spending and changes in consumer preferences. During periods of economic contraction, our revenues may decrease while most of our costs remain fixed and some costs even increase, resulting in decreased earnings.\nWe are subject to significant risks associated with joint ventures, strategic alliances and other third-party collaborations.\nWe pursue certain of our new license opportunities, development projects and other strategic business opportunities through third party collaborations such as joint ventures, license arrangements and other alliances. Examples include our joint ventures for Horseshoe Baltimore and our development project in Korea, our recently announced deal with Turner Sports regarding gaming-related sports content, and other sports-related opportunities.\nOur joint ventures are governed by mutually established agreements that we entered into with our partners. As such, we do not unilaterally control the joint ventures or other initiatives. The terms of the joint venture and the rights of our joint venture partners may preclude us from taking actions that we believe to be in the best interests of the Company. Alternatively, our joint venture partners could take actions binding on the joint venture without our consent. Disagreements with our joint venture partners could result in delays in project development, including construction delays, and ultimate failure of the project. Moreover, our joint venture partners may not be able to provide capital to the joint venture on the terms agreed to or at all, and the joint venture may be unable to obtain external financing to finance its operations. Also, our ability to exit the joint venture may be subject to contractual and other limitations.\nWith any third-party collaboration, there is a risk that our partners\u2019 economic, business or legal interests or objectives may not be aligned with ours, leading to potential disagreements and/or failure of the applicable project or initiative. Additionally, we are\nsubject to the risks relating to our partners\u2019 failure to satisfy contractual obligations, conflicts arising between us and any of our partners and changes in the ownership of any of our partners.\nAny of the foregoing with respect to our third-party collaborations could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nOur strategies to grow our business may be unsuccessful, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to grow our business. In addition to increasing our revenues from operations, we plan to grow our business through (i) real estate development domestically and internationally, (ii) traditional mergers and acquisitions, (iii) expanding our Caesars Rewards partnerships, and (iv) pursuing licensing and management agreements to utilize our brands on third party-owned properties. Our ability to execute on our growth strategy is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to finance development projects and to obtain all necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other governmental permits and authorizations, and upon risks inherent in acquisitions including the ability to finance acquisitions, the ability to integrate acquisitions, the ability to realize anticipated benefits of the acquisitions and the diversion of management\u2019s attention from Company resources. In addition, we may be unsuccessful in identifying acceptable third parties for Caesars Rewards and for licensing and managing properties. As a result, we may not be able to realize the growth we expect from our strategies, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Moreover, even if our growth strategy is successful, we may not realize the benefit we expect from our growth strategy on a timely basis or at all, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nIn addition, the Company may from time to time pursue strategic investments in pursuit of its growth strategy. There can be no assurance that any such investment will be successful or result in the benefits we expect within the expected time frame or at all. A failure of any strategic investment could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nWe are subject to extensive governmental regulation and taxation policies, and the enforcement of or any changes in such regulation or policy could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive gaming regulations and political and regulatory uncertainty. Regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions where we operate have broad powers with respect to the licensing of casino operations and may revoke, suspend, condition, or limit our gaming or other licenses, impose substantial fines and take other actions, any one of which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Furthermore, in many jurisdictions where we operate, licenses are granted for limited durations and require renewal from time to time. There can be no assurance that continued gaming activity will be approved in any referendum in the future. If we do not obtain the requisite approval in any future referendum, we will not be able to operate our gaming operations in the affected jurisdiction, which would negatively impact our future performance. In addition, the gaming and other laws and regulations to which we are subject could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. For example, in 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) reversed its previously-issued opinion published in 2011, which stated that interstate transmissions of wire communications that do not relate to a \u201csporting event or contest\u201d fall outside the purview of the Wire Act of 1961 (the \u201cWire Act\u201d). The DOJ\u2019s updated opinion, which is still being evaluated by industry members, concluded instead that the Wire Act was not uniformly limited to gaming relating to sporting events or contests and that certain of its provisions apply to non-sports-related wagering activity. Any such material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nFrom time to time, individual jurisdictions have also considered legislation or referendums, such as bans on smoking in casinos and other entertainment and dining facilities, which could adversely impact our operations. These smoking bans have adversely affected revenues and operating results at our properties. The likelihood or outcome of similar legislation in other jurisdictions and referendums in the future cannot be predicted, though any smoking ban would be expected to negatively impact our financial performance.\nFurthermore, because we are subject to regulation in each jurisdiction in which we operate, and because regulatory agencies within each jurisdiction review our compliance with gaming laws in other jurisdictions, it is possible that gaming compliance issues in one jurisdiction may lead to reviews and compliance issues in other jurisdictions.\nThe casino entertainment industry represents a significant source of tax revenues to the various jurisdictions in which casinos operate. From time to time, various state and federal legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws, or in the administration of such laws, including increases in tax rates, which would affect the industry. If adopted, such changes could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur ability to utilize net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards may be limited as a result of any future stock ownership changes.\nIn general, Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code provides an annual limitation with respect to the ability of a corporation to utilize its net operating loss carryovers, as well as certain built-in losses, against future taxable income in the event of a change in ownership. CEOC\u2019s emergence from bankruptcy and the CAC Merger resulted in a change in ownership for purposes of Section 382, making its provisions applicable to the Company. It is unlikely that the annual limitation caused as a result of the CAC Merger and CEOC\u2019s emergence from bankruptcy will adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to utilize its net operating loss carryovers against its future taxable income. However, if the Company undergoes another ownership change before all the net operating loss carryovers have offset taxable income, a future limitation may restrict the Company\u2019s ability to utilize its net operating loss carryover prospectively.\nAny violation of the Bank Secrecy Act or other similar anti-money laundering laws and regulations could have a negative impact on us.\nWe deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and AML regulations. In recent years, governmental authorities have been increasingly focused on AML policies and procedures, with a particular focus on the gaming industry. Any violation of AML or regulations by any of our resorts could have a negative effect on our results of operations.\nAny violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or other similar anti-corruption laws and regulations could have a negative impact on us.\nWe are subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the United States, which exposes us to complex foreign and U.S. regulations inherent in doing business cross-border and in each of the countries in which we conduct business. We are subject to requirements imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and other anti-corruption laws that generally prohibit U.S. companies and their affiliates from offering, promising, authorizing, or making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Violations of the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions and other penalties, and the SEC and DOJ have increased their enforcement activities with respect to the FCPA. Policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs that we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not be effective in prohibiting our employees, contractors, or agents from violating or circumventing our policies and the law. If our employees or agents fail to comply with applicable laws or company policies governing our international operations, we may face investigations, prosecutions, and other legal proceedings and actions that could result in civil penalties, administrative remedies, and criminal sanctions. Any determination that we have violated any anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions.\nOur stockholders are subject to extensive governmental regulation, and if a stockholder is found unsuitable by the gaming authority, that stockholder would not be able to beneficially own our common stock directly or indirectly.\nIn many jurisdictions, gaming laws can require any of our stockholders to file an application, be investigated, and qualify or have his, her or its suitability determined by gaming authorities. Gaming authorities have very broad discretion in determining whether an applicant should be deemed suitable. For any cause deemed reasonable by the gaming authorities, subject to certain administrative proceeding requirements, the gaming regulators have the authority to deny any application; limit, condition, restrict, revoke, or suspend any license, registration, finding of suitability or approval; or fine any person licensed, registered, or found suitable or approved. For additional information on the criteria used in making determinations regarding suitability, see Item 1, \u201cBusiness-Governmental Regulation.\u201d\nFor example, under Nevada gaming laws, each person who acquires, directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership of any voting security, or beneficial or record ownership of any non-voting security or any debt security, in a public corporation that is registered with the Nevada Gaming Commission (\u201cNGC\u201d), may be required to be found suitable if the NGC has reason to believe that his or her acquisition of that ownership, or his or her continued ownership in general, would be inconsistent with the declared public policy of Nevada, in the sole discretion of the NGC. Any person required by the NGC to be found suitable must apply for a finding of suitability within 30 days after the NGC\u2019s request that he or she should do so and, together with his or her application for suitability, deposit with the Nevada Gaming Control Board (\u201cNGCB\u201d) a sum of money which, in the sole discretion of the NGCB, will be adequate to pay the anticipated costs and charges incurred in the investigation and processing of that application for suitability, and deposit such additional sums as are required by the NGCB to pay final costs and charges.\nFurthermore, any person required by a gaming authority to be found suitable, who is found unsuitable by the gaming authority, may not hold, directly or indirectly, the beneficial ownership of any voting security or the beneficial or record ownership of any non-voting security or any debt security of any public corporation that is registered with the gaming authority beyond the time prescribed by the gaming authority. A violation of the foregoing may constitute a criminal offense. A finding of unsuitability by a\nparticular gaming authority impacts that person\u2019s ability to associate or affiliate with gaming licensees in that particular jurisdiction and could impact the person\u2019s ability to associate or affiliate with gaming licensees in other jurisdictions.\nMany jurisdictions also require any person who acquires beneficial ownership of more than a certain percentage of voting securities of a gaming company and, in some jurisdictions, non-voting securities, typically 5%, to report the acquisition to gaming authorities, and gaming authorities may require such holders to apply for qualification or a finding of suitability, subject to limited exceptions for \u201cinstitutional investors\u201d that hold a company\u2019s voting securities for investment purposes only. Under Maryland gaming laws, we may not sell or otherwise transfer more than 5% of the legal or beneficial interest in Horseshoe Baltimore without the approval of the Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control Commission if it determines that the transferee is qualified or grants the transferee an institutional investor waiver.\nSome jurisdictions may also limit the number of gaming licenses in which a person may hold an ownership or a controlling interest. For example, in Indiana, a person may not have an ownership interest in more than two Indiana riverboat owner\u2019s licenses, and in Maryland, an individual or business entity may not own an interest in more than one video lottery facility.\nIf we are unable to effectively compete against our competitors, our profits will decline.\nThe gaming industry is highly competitive and our competitors vary considerably in size, quality of facilities, number of operations, brand identities, marketing and growth strategies, financial strength and capabilities, and geographic diversity. We also compete with other non-gaming resorts and vacation areas, and with various other entertainment businesses. Our competitors in each region in which we participate may have greater financial, marketing, or other resources than we do, and there can be no assurance that they will not engage in aggressive pricing action to compete with us. Although we believe we are currently able to compete effectively in each of the various regions in which we participate, we cannot ensure that we will be able to continue to do so or that we will be capable of maintaining or further increasing our current market share. Our failure to compete successfully in our various regions could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow.\nIn recent years, many casino operators, including us, have been reinvesting in existing jurisdictions to attract new customers or to gain market share, thereby increasing competition in those jurisdictions. As companies have completed new expansion projects, supply has typically grown at a faster pace than demand in some areas. For example, in Baltimore, Maryland, the opening of MGM Resorts National Harbor Resort & Casino has resulted in significant declines in revenue at our Horseshoe Baltimore property. In Las Vegas, our largest jurisdiction, competition has increased significantly. For example, the Genting Group is developing a casino and hotel called Resorts World Las Vegas, and Marriott International and New York-based global real estate firm Witkoff are developing a casino and hotel called The Drew Las Vegas. Both are expected to open in 2020 on the northern end of the Las Vegas Strip. In response to changing trends, Las Vegas operators have been focused on expanding their non-gaming offerings, including upgrades to hotel rooms, new food and beverage offerings, and new entertainment offerings. In May 2018, MGM rebranded the Monte Carlo Hotel and Casino as Park MGM, which underwent non-gaming renovations focused on room, food and beverage, and entertainment enhancements. There have also been proposals for other large scale non-gaming development projects in Las Vegas by various other developers. The expansion of existing casino entertainment properties, the increase in the number of properties, and the aggressive marketing strategies of many of our competitors have increased competition in many markets in which we operate, and this intense competition is expected to continue. These competitive pressures have and are expected to continue to adversely affect our financial performance in certain areas, including Atlantic City, where Hard Rock Hotel Atlantic City and Ocean Resort Casino were introduced into the market in 2018, causing increased competition in the market. Growth in consumer demand for non-gaming offerings could also negatively impact our gaming revenue.\nIn particular, our business may be adversely impacted by the additional gaming and room capacity in Nevada, Louisiana, and Atlantic City and by the initiation and growth of online gaming in Nevada, Louisiana and other states. In addition, our operations located in New Jersey may be adversely impacted by the expansion of gaming in Maryland, New York, and Pennsylvania, our operations in Louisiana may be adversely impacted by the expansion of gaming in Mississippi and the Gulf Coast, and our operations located in Nevada may be adversely impacted by the expansion of gaming in California.\nIn addition, the gaming industry has expanded into new jurisdictions in which gaming was not previously permitted. This growth is likely to continue in the future and will result in increased competition for our facilities in the jurisdictions in which we operate.\nThe loss of the services of key personnel or the failure to manage our Chief Executive Officer transition could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe believe that the leadership of our executive officers has been a critical element of our success. On November 1, 2018, we announced that Mark P. Frissora, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will leave the Company. Subject to the terms of the Separation Agreement, Mr. Frissora will continue as President and Chief Executive Officer until a termination date of April 30, 2019 (which the Company may extend by one month) for purposes of continuity of leadership as the Company searches for a\nsuccessor to Mr. Frissora with the nationally recognized third-party search firm the Company has engaged for that purpose. Any failure by us to manage this leadership transition or a failure to timely identify a qualified permanent Chief Executive Officer could have a material adverse effect on our businesses. Our other executive officers and other members of senior management have substantial experience and expertise in our businesses that we believe will make significant contributions to our growth and success. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals could also adversely affect us. We do not have key man or similar life insurance policies covering members of our senior management. We have employment agreements with our executive officers, but these agreements do not guarantee that any given executive will remain with us, and there can be no assurance that any such officers will remain with us.\nIf we cannot attract, retain, and motivate employees, we may be unable to compete effectively, and lose the ability to improve and expand our businesses.\nOur success and ability to grow depend, in part, on our ability to hire, retain, and motivate sufficient numbers of talented people with the increasingly diverse skills needed to serve clients and expand our business in many locations around the world. We face intense competition for highly qualified, specialized technical, managerial, and consulting personnel. Recruiting, training, retention, and benefit costs place significant demands on our resources. Additionally, the impending departure of our Chief Executive Officer, Mark P. Frissora, and the ongoing search for a successor to Mr. Frissora may make recruiting executives to our businesses more difficult. The inability to attract qualified employees in sufficient numbers to meet particular demands or the loss of a significant number of our employees could have an adverse effect on us.\nOur business may be subject to seasonal fluctuations that could result in volatility and have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur business may be subject to some degree of seasonality. Weather conditions may deter or prevent customers from reaching the facilities or undertaking trips. Such conditions would particularly affect customers who are traveling longer distances to visit our properties. Seasonality may cause our properties working capital cash flow requirements to vary from quarter to quarter depending on the variability in the volume and timing of sales. Business in our properties can also fluctuate due to specific holidays or other significant events, such as Easter (particularly when the holiday falls in a different quarter than the prior year), the World Series of Poker tournament (with respect to our Las Vegas properties), city-wide conventions, a large sporting event or a concert, or visits by our premium players. We also believe that any seasonality, holiday, or other significant event may affect our various properties or regions differently. These factors, among other things, make forecasting more difficult and may adversely affect our properties\u2019 ability to manage working capital and to predict financial results accurately, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur business is particularly sensitive to energy prices and a rise in energy prices could harm our operating results.\nWe are a large consumer of electricity and other energy and, therefore, higher energy prices may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Accordingly, increases in energy costs may have a negative impact on our operating results. Additionally, higher electricity and gasoline prices that affect our customers may result in reduced visitation to our resorts and a reduction in our revenues. We may be indirectly impacted by regulatory requirements aimed at reducing the impacts of climate change directed at up-stream utility providers, as we could experience potentially higher utility, fuel, and transportation costs.\nWin rates (hold rates) for our casino operations depend on a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nThe gaming industry is characterized by an element of chance. Accordingly, we employ theoretical win rates to estimate what a certain type of game, on average, will win or lose in the long run. In addition to the element of chance, win rates (hold percentages) are also affected by the spread of table limits and factors that are beyond our control, such as a player\u2019s skill, experience, and behavior, the mix of games played, the financial resources of players, the volume of bets placed, and the amount of time players spend gambling. As a result of the variability in these factors, the actual win rates at our casinos may differ from the theoretical win rates we have estimated and could result in the winnings of our gaming customers exceeding those anticipated. The variability of win rates (hold rates) also have the potential to negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe face the risk of fraud, theft, and cheating.\nWe face the risk that gaming customers may attempt or commit fraud or theft or cheat in order to increase winnings. Such acts of fraud, theft, or cheating could involve the use of counterfeit chips or other tactics, possibly in collusion with our employees. Internal acts of cheating could also be conducted by employees through collusion with dealers, surveillance staff, floor managers, or other casino or gaming area staff. Additionally, we also face the risk that customers may attempt or commit fraud or theft with respect to our non-gaming offerings or against other customers. Such risks include stolen credit or charge cards or cash, falsified checks, theft of retail inventory and purchased goods, and unpaid or counterfeit receipts. Failure to discover such acts or schemes in a\ntimely manner could result in losses in our operations. Negative publicity related to such acts or schemes could have an adverse effect on our reputation, potentially causing a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to protect the intellectual property rights we own or may be prevented from using intellectual property necessary for our business.\nThe development of intellectual property is part of our overall business strategy, and we regard our intellectual property to be an important element of our success. We rely primarily on trade secret, trademark, domain name, copyright, and contract law to protect the intellectual property and proprietary technology we own. We also actively pursue business opportunities in the United States and in international jurisdictions involving the licensing of our trademarks to third parties. It is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property or proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our rights. For example, while we have a policy of entering into confidentiality, intellectual property invention assignment, and/or non-competition and non-solicitation agreements or restrictions with our employees, independent contractors, and business partners, such agreements may not provide adequate protection or may be breached, or our proprietary technology may otherwise become available to or be independently developed by our competitors. The laws of some foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights or intellectual property to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, the unauthorized use or reproduction of our trademarks could diminish the value of our trademarks and our market acceptance, competitive advantages, or goodwill, which could adversely affect our business.\nThird parties have alleged and may in the future allege that we are infringing, misappropriating, or otherwise violating their intellectual property rights. Third parties may initiate litigation against us without warning or may send us letters or other communications that make allegations without initiating litigation. We may elect not to respond to these letters or other communications if we believe they are without merit, or we may attempt to resolve these disputes out of court by negotiating a license, but in either case it is possible that such disputes will ultimately result in litigation. Any such claims could interfere with our ability to use technology or intellectual property that is material to the operation of our business. Such claims may be made by competitors seeking to obtain a competitive advantage or by other parties, such as entities that purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of bringing infringement claims. We also periodically employ individuals who were previously employed by our competitors or potential competitors, and we may therefore be subject to claims that such employees have used or disclosed the alleged trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers.\nIn the future, we may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets, determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Any such litigation, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs and the diversion of resources and the attention of management. If unsuccessful, such litigation could result in the loss of important intellectual property rights, require us to pay substantial damages, subject us to injunctions that prevent us from using certain intellectual property, require us to make admissions that affect our reputation in the marketplace, and require us to enter into license agreements that may not be available on favorable terms or at all. Finally, even if we prevail in any litigation, the remedy may not be commercially meaningful or fully compensate us for the harm we suffer or the costs we incur. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our performers and other entertainment offerings on acceptable terms or at all.\nOur properties\u2019 entertainment offerings are only under contract for a limited time. For example, Jennifer Lopez\u2019s contract expired in 2018 and the contracts for Backstreet Boys and Celine Dion are scheduled to end in 2019. These and other of our performers draw customers to our properties and are a significant source of our revenue. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our performers or other shows on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, the third parties that we depend on for our properties\u2019 entertainment offerings may become incapable or unwilling to provide their services at the level agreed upon or at all. These and other of our entertainment offerings draw customers to the properties and are a significant source of our revenue.\nWe extend credit to a portion of our customers, and we may not be able to collect gaming receivables from our credit customers.\nWe conduct our gaming activities on a credit and cash basis at many of our properties. Any such credit we extend is unsecured. Table games players typically are extended more credit than slot players, and high-stakes players typically are extended more credit than customers who tend to wager lower amounts. High-end gaming is more volatile than other forms of gaming, and variances in win-loss results attributable to high-end gaming may have a significant positive or negative impact on cash flow and earnings in a particular quarter. We extend credit to those customers whose level of play and financial resources warrant, in the opinion of management, an extension of credit. These large receivables could have a significant impact on our results of operations if deemed uncollectible. Gaming debts evidenced by a credit instrument, including what is commonly referred to as a \u201cmarker,\u201d\nand judgments on gaming debts are enforceable under the current laws of the jurisdictions in which we allow play on a credit basis, and judgments on gaming debts in such jurisdictions are enforceable in all U.S. states under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the U.S. Constitution. However, other jurisdictions may determine that enforcement of gaming debts is against public policy. Although courts of some foreign nations will enforce gaming debts directly and the assets in the U.S. of foreign debtors may be reached to satisfy a judgment, judgments on gaming debts from U.S. courts are not binding on the courts of many foreign nations.\nActs of terrorism, war, natural disasters, severe weather, and political, economic and military conditions may impede our ability to operate or may negatively impact our financial results.\nTerrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility have created many economic and political uncertainties. For example, a substantial number of the customers of our properties in Las Vegas use air travel. As a result of terrorist acts that occurred on September 11, 2001, domestic and international travel was severely disrupted, which resulted in a decrease in customer visits to our properties in Las Vegas. Visitation to Las Vegas also declined for a period of time following the mass shooting tragedy on October 1, 2017. We cannot predict the extent to which disruptions in air or other forms of travel as a result of any further terrorist act, security alerts or war, uprisings, or hostilities in places such as Iraq, Afghanistan, and/or Syria or other countries throughout the world, and governmental responses to those acts or hostilities, will directly or indirectly impact our business and operating results. For example, our operations in Cairo, Egypt, were negatively affected from the uprising there in January 2011. As a consequence of the threat of terrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility in the future, premiums for a variety of insurance products have increased, and some types of insurance are no longer available. If any such event were to affect our properties, we would likely be adversely affected.\nIn addition, natural and man-made disasters such as major fires, floods, severe snowstorms, hurricanes, earthquakes, and oil spills could also adversely impact our business and operating results. Such events could lead to the loss of use of one or more of our properties for an extended period of time and disrupt our ability to attract customers to certain of our gaming facilities. For example, Harrah\u2019s Metropolis Hotel & Casino and Horseshoe Southern Indiana each closed in late February 2018 for an extended period of time due to flooding from the Ohio River. In most cases, we have insurance that covers portions of any losses from a natural disaster, but it is subject to deductibles and maximum payouts in many cases. Although we may be covered by insurance from a natural disaster, the timing of our receipt of insurance proceeds, if any, may be out of our control. In some cases, however, we may receive no proceeds from insurance.\nAdditionally, a natural disaster affecting one or more of our properties may affect the level and cost of insurance coverage we may be able to obtain in the future, which may adversely affect our financial position.\nAs our operations depend in part on our customers\u2019 ability to travel, severe or inclement weather can also have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nWe have in the past and may in the future incur impairments to goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, or long-lived assets, which could negatively affect our future profits.\nWe perform our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of October 1. We perform this assessment more frequently if impairment indicators exist. We performed our annual goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount. We determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit based on a combination of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d), valuation multiples, and estimated future cash flows discounted at rates commensurate with the capital structure and cost of capital of comparable market participants, giving appropriate consideration to the prevailing borrowing rates within the casino industry in general. We also evaluate the aggregate fair value of all of our reporting units and other non-operating assets in comparison to our aggregate debt and equity market capitalization at the test date. EBITDA multiples and discounted cash flows are common measures used to value businesses in our industry.\nWe perform our annual impairment assessment of other non-amortizing intangible assets as of October 1. We perform this assessment more frequently if impairment indicators exist. We determine the estimated fair value of our non-amortizing intangible assets by primarily using the \u201cRelief from Royalty Method\u201d and \u201cExcess Earnings Method\u201d under the income approach.\nWe review the carrying value of our long-lived assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. As necessary, we typically estimate the fair value of assets starting with a \u201cReplacement Cost New\u201d approach and then deduct appropriate amounts for both functional and economic obsolescence to arrive at the fair value estimates. Other factors considered by management in performing this assessment may include current operating results, trends, prospects, and third-party appraisals, as well as the effect of demand, competition, and other economic, legal, and regulatory factors.\nDeclines in our stock price and increases in market yields within our industry, which are both factors used to determine the discount rate, along with downward adjustments to expectations of future performance at certain of our properties and the closure of casino operations at one of our properties outside of Las Vegas resulted in impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2018. If significant negative industry or economic trends, reduced estimates of future cash flows, disruptions to our business, slower growth rates or lack of growth in our business, or property closures or divestitures occur, we may be required to record additional impairment charges in future periods which may be material.\nWork stoppages and other labor problems could negatively impact our future profits.\nSome of our employees are represented by labor unions and, accordingly, we are subject to the risk of work stoppages or other labor disruptions from time to time. Approximately half of our hourly team members employed in the U.S. are covered by a collective bargaining agreement (\u201cCBA\u201d). Our CBAs are the product of good faith negotiations with the respective unions that represent employees in many of our facilities.\nWe currently have 32 CBAs covering various employees in Las Vegas expiring in 2019. Four unions represent the employees covered by 31 of those expiring agreements. Five agreements covering employees outside of Las Vegas were set to expire in 2018. We successfully negotiated renewal agreements for four of the five agreements, and the renewal terms expire in 2021 or later. With respect to the fifth agreement, we concluded negotiations, but the union was eventually decertified and replaced by another union. We anticipate that the new union will soon request to negotiate an agreement. All agreements are subject to automatic extension unless one party gives 60 days\u2019 prior notice of intent to terminate. No such notice has been given. We intend to negotiate renewal agreements or agree to extensions for all CBAs expiring and are hopeful that we will be able to reach agreements with the respective unions without any work stoppage. Work stoppages and other labor disruptions could have a material adverse impact on our operations.\nFrom time to time, we have also experienced attempts by labor organizations to organize certain of our non-union employees. These efforts have achieved some success to date. We cannot provide any assurance that we will not experience additional and successful union activity in the future. The impact of this union activity is undetermined and could negatively impact our profits.\nAny deterioration in our reputation or the reputation of our brands could adversely impact our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur business is dependent on the quality and reputation of our Company and brands. Events beyond our control could affect the reputation of one or more of our properties or more generally impact our corporate or brand image. Other factors that could influence our reputation include the quality of the services we offer and our actions with regard to social issues such as diversity, human rights and support for local communities. Broad access to social media makes it easy for anyone to provide public feedback that can influence perceptions of us, our brands or our properties. It may be difficult to control or effectively manage negative publicity, regardless of whether it is accurate. Negative events and publicity could quickly and materially damage perceptions of us, our brands or our properties, which, in turn, could adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations through loss of customers, loss of business opportunities, lack of acceptance of our company to operate in host communities, employee retention or recruiting difficulties or other difficulties.\nWe may be subject to material environmental liability, including as a result of unknown environmental contamination.\nOur business is subject to certain federal, state, and local environmental, health, and safety laws, regulations, and ordinances that govern activities or operations that may have adverse environmental effects, such as emissions to air, discharges to streams and rivers, and releases of hazardous substances and pollutants into the environment, as well as handling and disposal from municipal/non-hazardous waste, and that also apply to current and previous owners or operators of real estate generally. Federal examples of these laws include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation Recovery Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. Our failure to comply with these laws, including any required permits or licenses, could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct some of our operations. Certain of these laws may impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused particular contamination or release of hazardous substances and regardless of whether the practices that resulted in the contamination were legal at the time that they occurred. Should unknown contamination be discovered on any of our properties, or should a release of hazardous substances occur on any of our properties, we could be required to investigate and clean up the contamination and could also be held responsible to a governmental entity or third parties for property damage, personal injury, or investigation and cleanup costs incurred in connection with the contamination or release, which may be substantial. Moreover, such contamination may also impair our ability to use or develop the affected property. Such liability could be joint and several in nature, regardless of fault, and could affect us even if such property is vacated. The potential for substantial costs and an inability to use the property could adversely affect our business. New and more stringent environmental, health, and\nsafety regulations and permit requirements or stricter interpretations of current laws or regulations, such as those related to climate change, could also impose substantial additional costs on our business.\nOur insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses we could suffer, and, in the future, our insurance costs may increase significantly, or we may be unable to obtain the same level of insurance coverage.\nWe may suffer damage to our property caused by a casualty loss (such as fire, natural disasters, and acts of war or terrorism) that could severely disrupt our business or subject it to claims by third parties who are injured or harmed. Although we maintain insurance (including property, casualty, terrorism, and business interruption), it may be inadequate or unavailable to cover all of the risks to which our business and assets may be exposed. In several cases, we maintain extremely high deductibles or self-insure against specific losses. Should an uninsured loss (including a loss that is less than our deductible) or loss in excess of insured limits occur, it could have a significant adverse impact on our operations and revenues.\nWe generally renew our insurance policies on an annual basis. If the cost of coverage becomes too high, we may need to reduce our policy limits or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage in order to reduce the premiums to an acceptable amount. Among other factors, homeland security concerns, other catastrophic events, or any change in the current U.S. statutory requirement that insurance carriers offer coverage for certain acts of terrorism could adversely affect available insurance coverage and result in increased premiums on available coverage (which may cause us to elect to reduce our policy limits) and additional exclusions from coverage. Among other potential future adverse changes, in the future we may elect to not, or may be unable to, obtain any coverage for losses due to acts of terrorism.\nThe success of third parties adjacent to our properties is important to our ability to generate revenue and operate our business and any deterioration to their success could materially adversely affect our revenue and result of operations.\nIn certain cases, we do not own the businesses and amenities adjacent to our properties. However, the adjacent third-party businesses and amenities stimulate additional traffic through our complexes, including the casinos, which are our largest generators of revenue. Any decrease in the popularity of, or the number of customers visiting, these adjacent businesses and amenities may lead to a corresponding decrease in the traffic through our complexes, which would negatively affect our business and operating results. Further, if newly opened properties are not as popular as expected, we will not realize the increase in traffic through our properties that we expect as a result of their opening, which would negatively affect our business projections.\nWe may require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe intend to continue to make significant investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, expand into new markets, improve our operating infrastructure, or acquire complementary businesses, personnel, and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. Any debt financing we secure in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, if at all. There can be no assurances that we could pursue a future offering of securities or enter into a new credit facility at an appropriate price and/or terms to raise the necessary financing. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when required, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur obligation to contribute to multi-employer pension plans, or discontinuance of such obligations, may have an adverse impact on us.\nWe contribute to and participate in various multi-employer pension plans for employees represented by certain unions. We are required to make contributions to these plans in amounts established under CBAs. We do not administer these plans and, generally, are not represented on the boards of trustees of these plans. The Pension Protection Act enacted in 2006 (the \u201cPPA\u201d) requires under-funded pension plans to improve their funding ratios. Based on the information available to us, some of the multi-employer plans to which we contribute are either \u201ccritical\u201d or \u201cendangered\u201d as those terms are defined in the PPA. Specifically, the HEREIU Intermediary Plan (a spin-off of the Pension Plan of the UNITE HERE National Retirement Fund, effective January 1, 2018) is less than 65% funded. We cannot determine at this time the amount of additional funding, if any, we may be required to make to these plans. However, plan assessments could have an adverse impact on our results of operations or cash flows for a given period. Furthermore, under current law, upon the termination of a multi-employer pension plan, due to the withdrawal of all its contributing employers (a mass withdrawal), or in the event of a withdrawal by us, which we consider from time to time, we would be required to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of the plan\u2019s unfunded vested liabilities, and that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nFuture sales or the possibility of future sales of a substantial amount of our common stock may depress the price of shares of our common stock.\nFuture sales or the availability for sale of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future sales of equity securities.\nAs of February 19, 2019, there were 670 million shares of our common stock outstanding, all of which are the same class of voting common stock. All of the outstanding shares of our common stock will be eligible for resale under Rule 144 or Rule 701 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (\u201cSecurities Act\u201d), subject to volume limitations, applicable holding period requirements or other contractual restrictions.\nIn connection with the CAC Merger, the Plan, and CEOC\u2019s emergence from bankruptcy, we issued a significant number of shares of our common stock and a significant amount of notes that are convertible into shares of our common stock. We may issue shares of common stock or other securities from time to time as consideration for future acquisitions and investments or for any other reason that our Board of Directors deems advisable. If any such acquisition or investment is significant, the number of shares of our common stock, or the number or aggregate principal amount, as the case may be, of other securities that we may issue may in turn be substantial. We may also grant registration rights covering those shares of common stock or other securities in connection with any such acquisitions and investments.\nWe cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or other securities or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of our common stock or other securities will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of common stock (including shares of common stock issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nThe price and trading volume of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. In addition, the trading volume of our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. Volatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent a holder of our common stock from being able to sell their shares. The market price for our common stock could fluctuate significantly for various reasons, including:\n\u2022\nour operating and financial performance and prospects;\n\u2022\nour quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nconditions that impact demand for our products and services;\n\u2022\nthe public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts who track our common stock;\n\u2022\nmarket and industry perception of our success, or lack thereof, in pursuing our growth strategy;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u2022\nchanges in government and environmental regulation, including gaming taxes;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations, or principles;\n\u2022\narrival and departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nchanges in our capital structure;\n\u2022\nsales of common stock by us or members of our management team;\n\u2022\nthe expiration of contractual lockup agreements; and\n\u2022\nchanges in general market, economic, and political conditions in the United States and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from natural disasters, terrorist attacks, acts of war, and responses to such events.\nIn addition, the stock market experiences significant price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies, including companies in the gaming, lodging, hospitality, and entertainment industries. The changes frequently appear to occur without regard to the operating performance of the affected companies. Hence,\nthe price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with us, and these fluctuations could materially reduce our share price.\nHolders of our common stock should not expect to receive dividends on shares of our common stock.\nWe have no present plans to pay cash dividends to our stockholders and, for the foreseeable future, intend to retain all of our earnings for use in our business. The declaration of any future dividends by us is within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be dependent on our earnings, financial condition and capital requirements, as well as any other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.\nOur actual financial results after CEOC\u2019s emergence from bankruptcy may not be comparable to our historical financial information as a result of the implementation of the Plan and the transactions contemplated thereby.\nIn connection with the disclosure statement CEOC filed with the Bankruptcy Court, and the hearing to consider confirmation of the Plan, CEOC prepared projected financial information to demonstrate to the Bankruptcy Court the feasibility of the Plan and CEOC\u2019s ability to continue operations upon its emergence from bankruptcy. In connection with the proxy statement/prospectus relating to the merger of CAC and CEC filed with the SEC, we also disclosed certain projections. These projections were prepared solely for the purpose for which they were filed and have not been, and will not be, updated on an ongoing basis and should not be relied upon by investors. Although the financial projections disclosed in the disclosure statement filed with the Bankruptcy Court and the proxy statement/prospectus relating to the merger of CAC and CEC represented certain views based on then current known facts and assumptions about the future operations of CEOC and the Company, there is no guarantee that the financial projections will be realized. We may not be able to meet the projected financial results or achieve projected revenues and cash flows assumed in projecting future business prospects. To the extent we do not meet the projected financial results or achieve projected revenues and cash flows, we may lack sufficient liquidity to continue operating as planned and may be unable to service our debt obligations as they come due or may not be able to meet our operational needs. Any one of these failures may preclude us from, among other things: (a) taking advantage of future opportunities; (b) growing our businesses; or (c) responding to future changes in the gaming industry. Further, our failure to meet the projected financial results or achieve projected revenues and cash flows could lead to cash flow and working capital constraints, which constraints may require us to seek additional working capital. We may not be able to obtain such working capital, when it is required.\nPRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT\nThis Form 10-K contains or may contain \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
