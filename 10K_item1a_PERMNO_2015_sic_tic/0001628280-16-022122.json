RISK FACTORS.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nChanges to our businesses, operating structure, financial reporting structure, or personnel relating to the implementation of our 2020 Vision strategic transformation initiative, including our move to a shared services center, may not have the desired effects on our financial condition and results of operations.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2015, we announced our transformation initiative (\u201c2020 Vision\u201d), which is intended to differentiate ABM in the marketplace, accelerate revenue growth for certain industry groups, and improve our margin profile. We may not be able to execute on this strategy as a result of numerous factors, such as client resistance to an integrated approach, inability to deliver requested end-to-end services, and difficulty penetrating certain markets. Even if we are able to execute our 2020 Vision, we may not realize the full benefits that we currently expect within the anticipated time frame or at all. For example, although we may be able to leverage scale to manage costs more efficiently and effectively, the realignment of our business operations may not provide us with the anticipated competitive advantage or revenue growth. Moreover, the execution of our 2020 Vision may result in substantial expenses in excess of what is currently forecast. While we anticipate that certain expenses will be incurred, such expenses are difficult to estimate accurately and may exceed current estimates. Accordingly, the benefits from our 2020 Vision may be offset by costs or delays incurred in its execution. In addition, our 2020 Vision may cause substantial disruption to our operations and may not have the anticipated positive effects on our relationships with our employees, clients, and suppliers.\nThe migration of many of our financial reporting and processes to our shared services center may not create the operational efficiencies that we expect. In addition, the move to a shared services environment may create risks relating to the processing of transactions and recording of financial information. During the transition period, we could experience a lapse in the operation of internal controls due to turnover, lack of legacy knowledge, and inappropriate training, which could result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses.\nWe announced that we intend to sell our Government Services business in 2017. However, we cannot provide assurances about the timing of the sale or that such sale will ultimately occur. Any potential sale transaction is dependent upon a number of factors that may be beyond our control, including market conditions, industry trends, the interest of third parties in our Government Services business, board of directors approval, and the availability of financing to potential buyers. In addition, the costs that we may incur in connection with the planned sale may not be recovered if a sale is not consummated upon anticipated terms.\nWe may face difficulties identifying, acquiring, and integrating businesses.\nIn the past, a significant portion of our growth has been generated by acquisitions, and we expect to continue to acquire businesses in the future as part of our growth strategy. If there is a slowdown in the pace or size of our acquisitions, we could experience a slower growth rate. In addition, there is no assurance that anticipated synergistic benefits will be achieved. The areas in which we may face risks in connection with any potential acquisition of a business include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nmanagement time and focus may be diverted from operating our business to acquisition integration;\n\u2022\nclients or key employees of an acquired business may not remain, which could negatively impact our ability to grow that acquired business;\n\u2022\nintegration of the acquired business\u2019s accounting, information technology, human resources, and other administrative systems may fail to permit effective management and expense reduction;\n\u2022\nimplementing internal controls, procedures, and policies appropriate for a public company may fail in an acquired business that lacks some of these controls, procedures, and policies;\n\u2022\nadditional indebtedness incurred as a result of an acquisition may impact our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows; and\n\u2022\nunanticipated or unknown liabilities may arise relating to the acquired business.\nWe have high deductibles for certain insurable risks, and therefore we are subject to volatility associated with those risks, including the possibility that changes in estimates of ultimate insurance losses could result in a material charge against our earnings.\nWe use a combination of insured and self-insurance programs to cover workers\u2019 compensation, general liability, automobile liability, property damage, and other insurable risks. We are responsible for claims both within and in excess of our retained limits under our insurance policies, and while we endeavor to purchase insurance coverage that is appropriate to our assessment of risk, we are unable to predict with certainty the frequency, nature, or magnitude of claims for direct or consequential damages. If our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable, our business may be negatively impacted.\nShould we be unable to renew our excess, umbrella, or other commercial insurance policies at competitive rates, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, as would the incurrence of catastrophic uninsured claims or the inability or refusal of our insurance carriers to pay otherwise insured claims. Further, to the extent that we self-insure our losses, deterioration in our loss control and/or continuing claim management efforts could increase the overall cost of claims within our retained limits. A material change in our insurance costs due to changes in the frequency of claims, the severity of the claims, the costs of excess/umbrella premiums, or regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nThe determination of required insurance reserves is dependent upon significant actuarial judgments. We use the results of actuarial studies to estimate insurance rates and insurance reserves for future periods and to adjust reserves, if appropriate, for prior years. Actual experience related to our insurance reserves can cause us to change our estimates for reserves and any such changes may materially impact results, causing significant volatility in our operating results. We have experienced material negative trends and may continue to experience these and other material negative trends in future periods.\nOur risk management and safety programs may not have the intended effect of allowing us to reduce our insurance costs for casualty programs.\nWe attempt to mitigate the aforementioned risk that our insurance coverage may be inadequate or unavailable through the implementation of company-wide safety and loss control efforts designed to decrease the incidence of accidents or events that might increase our liability. Our claims data in 2016 is showing improvement, however this trend data is not yet fully mature and claims and severity data are subject to significant volatility and may not mitigate these risks.\nOur business success depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and senior management.\nOur future performance depends on the continuing services and contributions of our senior management to execute on our organic growth and acquisition strategy and to identify and pursue new opportunities. Our future success also depends, in large degree, on our continued ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. Any unplanned turnover in senior management or inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could have a negative effect on our results of operations.\nOur business success depends on our ability to preserve long-term client relationships.\nWe primarily provide services pursuant to agreements that are cancelable by either party upon 30 to 90 days\u2019 notice. As we generally incur higher initial costs on new contracts until the labor management and facilities operations normalize, our business associated with long-term client relationships is generally more profitable than short-term client relationships. If we lose a significant number of long-term clients, our profitability could be negatively impacted, even if we gain equivalent revenues from new clients.\nLosses or other incidents at facilities in which we operate could cause significant damage to our reputation and financial loss.\nWe depend to a large extent on our relationships with our clients and our reputation for quality integrated facility solutions. As such, adverse publicity stemming from an accident or other incident involving our facility operations or food and nutrition services related to injury, illness, or death could harm our reputation and expose us to significant liability.\nOur success depends on our ability to continue to gain profitable business despite competitive pressures.\nWe believe that each aspect of our business is highly competitive and that such competition is based primarily on price, quality of service, and ability to anticipate and respond to industry changes. A majority of our revenue is derived from projects requiring competitive bids; however, an invitation to bid is often conditioned upon prior experience, industry expertise, and financial strength. The low cost of entry in the facility services business results in a very competitive market. We mainly compete with regional and local owner-operated companies that may have more acute vision into local markets and significantly lower labor and overhead costs, providing them with a competitive advantage. We also compete indirectly with companies that can perform for themselves one or more of the services we provide. Our parking business could be negatively impacted by the construction of new parking facilities near our existing facilities. In addition, we could experience reduced parking revenues related to market displacement by ride sharing companies. Further, if we are unable to respond adequately to changing technology, we may lose existing clients and fail to win future business opportunities. These strong competitive pressures could inhibit our success in bidding for profitable business and our ability to increase prices as costs rise, thereby reducing margins.\nCosts that we cannot pass through to clients could affect our profitability.\nMany of our contracts provide that our clients pay certain costs at specified rates, such as insurance, healthcare costs, salary and salary-related expenses, petroleum, and other costs. We may experience higher operating costs related to changes in federal, state, or local laws and regulations regarding the classification of employees and/or their eligibility for overtime. If actual costs exceed the rates specified in the contracts, our profitability may be negatively impacted unless we can negotiate price increases with the client.\nOur business may be negatively impacted by adverse weather conditions.\nWeather conditions, such as snow storms, heavy flooding, hurricanes, and other fluctuations in temperatures, can negatively impact portions of our business. Within our Building & Energy Solutions segment, cooler than normal temperatures in the summer could reduce the need for servicing of air conditioning units, resulting in reduced revenues and profitability. Within the Parking and Other segments, snow can lead to reduced travel activity, as well as increases in certain costs, both of which negatively affect gross profit. On the other hand, the absence of snow during the winter could cause us to experience reduced revenues in our Janitorial segment as many of our contracts specify additional payments for snow-related services.\nNegative or unexpected tax consequences could adversely affect our results of operations.\nAdverse changes in the underlying profitability and financial outlook of our operations or changes in tax law could lead to changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheets, which could materially affect our results of operations. In addition, we are also subject to tax audits by governmental authorities in the United States and United Kingdom. If we experience unfavorable results from one or more such tax audits, there could be an adverse effect on our tax rate and therefore our net income.\nWe may not achieve the expected benefits from our captive insurance company.\nIn 2015, we formed IFM Assurance Company (\u201cIFM\u201d), a wholly-owned captive insurance company. IFM is part of our enterprise-wide, multi-year insurance strategy that is intended to better position our risk and safety programs and provide us with increased flexibility in the end-to-end management of our insurance programs as well as contribute to efficiencies relating to our insurance programs over time. There can be no assurance that IFM will bring about the intended benefits relating to our risk and safety programs or that it will provide us with increased flexibility in the management of our insurance programs, because we may experience unanticipated events that will reduce or eliminate expected benefits. In addition, expected cash tax savings related to coverage provided by IFM may not be as much as anticipated.\nChanges in energy prices and government regulations could adversely impact the results of operations of our Building & Energy Solutions business.\nEnergy efficiency projects are designed to reduce a client\u2019s overall consumption of commodities such as electricity and natural gas. As such, downward fluctuations in commodity prices may reduce clients\u2019 demand for our services. We also depend, in part, on federal and state legislation and policies that support energy efficiency projects. If current legislation or policies are amended, eliminated, or not extended beyond their current expiration dates, or if funding for energy incentives is reduced or delayed, it could also adversely affect our ability to obtain new business. In some instances, we offer certain of these clients guaranteed energy savings on installed equipment. In the event\nthose guaranteed savings are not achieved, we may be required to pay liquidated or other damages. All of these factors could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nSignificant delays or reductions in appropriations for our government contracts may negatively affect our business and could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe funding of U.S. government programs is subject to annual congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes. In many situations, Congress appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though the contract performance period may extend over several fiscal years. Accordingly, programs are often partially funded and additional funds are committed only as Congress makes further appropriations. If we incur costs in excess of funds committed on a contract, we may not receive reimbursement of those costs unless additional funds are appropriated. In the event that government funding for any of the programs relating to our U.S. government contracts is reduced or delayed, the U.S. government could terminate or adjust our contracts or subcontracts under such program, which could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur ability to do business may be affected by the failure of our joint venture partners to perform their obligations.\nThe success of our joint ventures depends, in large degree, on the satisfactory performance by our joint venture partners of their obligations, including any obligation to commit capital, equity, or credit support as required by the joint venture agreements. If a joint venture partner fails to perform its obligations as a result of financial or other difficulties or any other reason, the joint venture may be unable to perform or deliver its contracted services. In addition, we also participate in joint ventures where we are not a controlling party, and in these cases, we may have limited control over the joint venture. Any improper actions by our joint venture employees, partners, or agents, including, but not limited to, failure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practice Act or the U.K. Bribery Act, could result in civil or criminal investigations, monetary and non-monetary penalties, or suspension or debarment from government contracts, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows as well as our reputation and ability to conduct business.\nWe could be subject to cyber-security risks, information technology interruptions, and business continuity risks.\nOur information technology systems and those of our third-party providers could become subject to cyber attacks, hacking, or other intrusions, which could result in operational disruptions or information misappropriation, such as theft of intellectual property or inappropriate disclosure of confidential information. In addition, to the extent centralized administrative locations are disabled for a long period of time, key business processes, such as accounts payable, information technology, payroll, and general management operations, could be interrupted. Any such operational disruptions and/or misappropriation of information could result in lost sales, negative publicity, or business delays that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOperations in areas of military conflict expose us to additional risks.\nAlthough substantially all of our operations are conducted in the United States, some of our international services are conducted in areas of military conflict or at military installations, which increases the risk of a situation causing injury or loss of life to our employees, subcontractors, or other third parties. In addition to the human costs, this could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows and our ability to conduct business.\nRisks Related to Market and Economic Conditions\nGeneral reductions in commercial office building occupancy could affect our revenues and profitability.\nIn certain geographic areas and service lines, our most profitable revenues are related to services performed for tenants in buildings where we perform building services for the property owner or management company (\u201ctag work\u201d). A decline in occupancy rates could result in a decline in scope of work, including tag work, and depressed prices for our services. If this were to occur, we could experience lower revenues and pricing pressures resulting in lower margins. Additionally, further consolidation of property management companies, as well as adverse changes in occupancy rates, may further reduce demand, depress prices for our services, and cause clients to cancel our service agreements.\nDeterioration of general economic conditions could reduce the demand for facility services and, as a result, reduce our earnings and adversely affect our financial condition.\nSlow domestic and international economic growth or other negative changes in global, national, and local economic conditions could have a negative impact on our business. Specifically, adverse economic conditions may result in clients cutting back on discretionary spending, such as tag work. Additionally, since a significant portion of our aviation services and parking revenues are tied to the number of airline passengers, hotel guests, and sports arena attendees, results for these businesses could be adversely affected by curtailment of business, personal travel, and discretionary spending.\nRisks Related to Labor and Legal Proceedings\nUnfavorable developments in our class and representative actions and other lawsuits alleging various claims could cause us to incur substantial liabilities.\nOur business involves employing tens of thousands of employees, many of whom work at our clients\u2019 facilities. We incur risks relating to our employment of these workers, including, but not limited to: claims of misconduct or negligence on the part of our employees; claims related to the employment of undocumented workers or unlicensed personnel; and claims by our employees of discrimination, harassment, or violations of wage and hour requirements. Some or all of these claims may lead to litigation, including class action litigation, and these matters may cause us to incur negative publicity with respect to these alleged problems. It is not possible to predict the outcome of these lawsuits or any other proceeding, and our insurance may not cover all claims that may be asserted against us. These lawsuits and other proceedings may consume substantial amounts of our financial and managerial resources. An unfavorable outcome with respect to these lawsuits and any future lawsuits could, individually or in the aggregate, cause us to incur substantial liabilities that could have a material adverse effect upon our business, reputation, financial condition, or results of operations.\nChanges in immigration laws or enforcement actions or investigations under such laws could significantly adversely affect our labor force, operations, and financial results.\nAs many of our jobs do not require our employees to be able to read or write the English language, we are an attractive employer for recent \u00e9migr\u00e9s to this country. While immigration laws require us to take certain steps intended to confirm the legal status of our immigrant labor force, and while we bolster these steps with additional measures designed to reinforce compliance, we may nonetheless inadvertently employ workers who are or become undocumented. Violations of laws and regulations could subject us to substantial fines and penalties. To the extent that these laws and regulations and corresponding enforcement practices and compliance standards become more stringent, our results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nOur participation in multiemployer pension plans could result in material liabilities.\nWe participate in various multiemployer pension plans under union and industry-wide agreements, which provide defined pension benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. Because of the nature of multiemployer plans, there are risks associated with participation in these plans that differ from single-employer plans. Assets contributed by an employer to a multiemployer plan are not segregated into a separate account and are not restricted to provide benefits only to employees of that contributing employer. In the event another participating employer in a multiemployer plan no longer contributes to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers, including us. In the event of the termination of a multiemployer pension plan or a withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan, under applicable law we could incur material liabilities. We further\ndiscuss our participation in multiemployer pension and postretirement plans in Note 15, \u201cEmployee Benefit Plans,\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAt October 31, 2016, approximately 40% of our employees were subject to various local collective bargaining agreements, some of which will expire or become subject to renegotiation during 2017. In addition, at any given time we may face a number of union organizing drives. When one or more of our major collective bargaining agreements becomes subject to renegotiation or when we face union organizing drives, we and the union may disagree on important issues that could lead to a strike, work slowdown, or other job actions at one or more of our locations. In a market where we are unionized but competitors are not unionized, we could lose clients to such competitors. A strike, work slowdown, or other job action could disrupt our services, resulting in reduced revenues or contract cancellations. Moreover, negotiating a first time agreement or renegotiating an existing collective bargaining agreement could result in a substantial increase in labor and benefits expenses that we may be unable to pass through to clients.\nRisks Relating to Indebtedness and Impairment Charges\nFuture increases in the level of our borrowings or in interest rates could affect our results of operations.\nAny future increase in the level of our borrowings will likely increase our interest expense. Unless the operating income associated with the use of these funds exceeds the borrowing expense, our profitability could be negatively impacted. In addition, a portion of cash flows from operating activities are dedicated to interest payments and repayment of borrowings, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund operations or to capitalize on future business opportunities. As current interest rates on our line of credit are variable, an increase in prevailing rates would increase our interest costs. Further, our syndicated credit agreement contains both financial covenants and other covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified transactions, which may also constrain our flexibility.\nImpairment of goodwill and long-lived assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually, in the fourth quarter, or more often if impairment indicators exist. We also review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If the fair value of one of our reporting units is less than its carrying value, or if as a result of a recoverability test we conclude that the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount, we would record an impairment charge related to goodwill or long-lived assets, respectively. The assumptions used to determine impairment require significant judgment and the amount of the impairment could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results for the period in which the charge is taken. During 2016, we recorded impairment charges of $22.5 million related to our held-for-sale Government Services business, consisting of both goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges. See Note 4, \u201cHeld for Sale,\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nOther\nActions of activist investors could disrupt our business.\nPublic companies have been the target of activist investors. In the event that a third party, such as an activist investor, proposes to change our governance policies, board of directors, or other aspects of our operations, our review and consideration of such proposals may create a significant distraction for our management and employees. This could negatively impact our ability to execute our 2020 Vision and may require our management to expend significant time and resources. Such proposals may also create uncertainties with respect to our financial position and operations and may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key employees.\nCatastrophic events, disasters, and terrorist attacks could disrupt our services.\nCatastrophic events, disasters, and acts of terrorism may result in reduced revenues, property damage, or economic dislocations throughout the country. These events may increase the volatility of financial results due to unforeseen costs with partial or no corresponding compensation from clients.", "PERMNO": 47730, "SIC": 7340, "TIC": "ABM"}
