Risk Factors.\nThe following are some of the potential risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. You should carefully consider these factors, as well as the other information contained in this document, when evaluating your investment in our securities. The following list of important factors is not all-inclusive.\nWe are dependent upon certain key supply chain and distribution agreements. We have significant arrangements with a small number of technology suppliers. If we experience disruptions in our supply chain with these manufacturers for any reason or lose our distribution rights, we may not be able to fulfill client commitments with an acceptable alternative or we may not be able to obtain alternative solutions at similar costs.\nWe are dependent upon the demand for our products and services. We and our competitors in the industry are dependent on the demand for the products and services that we deliver. Changes in technology or other unforeseen developments within our industry could result in decreased demand for our products and services. We cannot guarantee that historical levels of demand will continue or increase in the future.\nWe face intense competition. We operate in a highly competitive industry. Our competitors, who include our technology suppliers and certain clients, may be able to deliver products and services at better prices or more quickly due to factors beyond our control. New competitors may also emerge in the future, which may threaten our ability to sustain or grow our market share. We cannot guarantee that we can continue to compete effectively in the future and still be able to sustain our historical levels of profit margin.\nOur financial results are dependent on our economic environments. We, our clients or our vendors may experience economic hardships due to inflation or recession, changes in laws and regulations, business disruptions due to natural disasters, acts of terrorism or war or other factors that are beyond our control and that could negatively impact our financial condition or our ability to meet our future financial goals.\nOur ability to experience organic growth is dependent upon successful execution of new initiatives. On April 1, 2013, we experienced a change in management, including a new Chief Executive Officer. In connection therewith, we re-aligned our organizational structure and introduced new programs in order to better capitalize on internal assets and expertise, which we believe will enable us to introduce new product and service offerings as well as to support additional offerings for our clients resulting in increased revenues (including organic growth) and profitability. The failure of these programs could have a material adverse effect on our ability to increase revenues and profitability.\nOur business operations could be disrupted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately. The efficient operation of our business depends on our information technology systems. We rely on our information technology systems to effectively manage our business data, communications, order entry and fulfillment and other business processes. The failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies and the loss of sales and customers, causing our business and results of operations to suffer. In addition, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control, including fire, natural disasters, power outages, systems failures, security breaches and viruses. Any such damage or interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur revenue is dependent upon repeat client business and generally is not subject to long-term contracts. A majority of our revenue is generated through individual sales of products and services and less than twenty (20%) of our revenue is generated from long-term maintenance contracts. We depend on repeat client business as well as our ability to develop new client business to sustain and grow our revenue. Although our focus on delivering high-quality sales and service has proven to be successful in the past, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to grow or even sustain our current level of revenue in the future.\nA significant part of our business involves public sector clients which provides unique risks. Approximately 20% of our revenues is derived from sales to agencies and departments of federal, state and local governments. Legislatures typically appropriate funds for a given program annually. These appropriations may be influenced by, among other things, the state of the economy, competing priorities for appropriation, changes in administration or control of legislatures, the timing and amount of tax receipts and the overall level of government expenditures. A decrease in appropriations for certain programs could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, our revenues from sales to these public sector clients are made through various direct contracts, through reseller agreements with government contractors and through open market sales. Government contracting is a highly-regulated area. Failure to comply with regulations or contracts could subject us to fines, penalties, suspension or debarment from doing business with such clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are dependent upon the retention of our key personnel. The success of our business depends on our ability to attract and retain quality employees, executives and directors. We offer comprehensive salary and benefit packages including long-term incentives as a means of attracting and retaining personnel. We face pressure to maintain our profit margins and remain competitive in our industry while we compete for personnel in our local markets with a variety of different businesses that may be able to offer more attractive incentives due to their individual financial situations. We cannot guarantee that we will continue to attract and retain personnel with our current incentives and at costs that are consistent with our projected profit margins.\nWe are dependent upon future mergers and acquisitions, including successful integration, for a portion of our growth. A key component of our long-term growth strategy is through strategic mergers and acquisitions and our future financial results are dependent upon the successful integration of those acquisitions. We may not continue to be successful in our search for potential acquisition candidates that are acceptable for our business model, or we may not be successful in our attempts to acquire new businesses that we have identified as attractive acquisition candidates. We cannot guarantee that we will meet our projected growth targets in the future if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to acquire additional businesses.\nWe can provide no assurance that we will continue to have adequate liquidity. Although we generate positive cash flow and have access to a significant amount of additional credit, we cannot be certain that our current liquidity situation will be adequate in future periods. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain our positive cash flow position, obtain additional credit or raise additional capital which may restrict our ability to operate or to pursue new business opportunities in the future.\nWe are subject to the risks of international operations. We operate in countries outside of the United States. Our operations or our financial condition may be negatively affected by events surrounding our international operations such as changes in laws and regulations, political or economic instability, currency fluctuations, supply chain disruptions, acts of terrorism, natural disasters or other political, economic or environmental factors. We cannot rely on the past results of our international operations as an indicator of future results or assure you that we will not be adversely affected by those factors inherent with international operations.\nOur stock price fluctuates. Our stock price is affected by a number of factors, including quarterly variations in our financial results. As a result, our stock price is subject to volatility.\nWe have a significant amount of goodwill and could accumulate additional goodwill that could be subject to impairment. As a result of our past acquisition program and given the service nature of our business, we have accumulated goodwill. Part of our long-term growth strategy is to acquire strategic companies in high growth markets and given the potential service nature of those future acquisitions, we will accumulate additional goodwill. We conduct an impairment assessment of the carrying value of our goodwill at least annually and we monitor market conditions to determine if any additional interim review of goodwill is warranted. Deterioration in the market or under performance of past or future acquisitions could result in a future impairment. In the event that we determine that our goodwill is impaired in the future, we would need to recognize a non-cash impairment charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated balance sheet and results of operations.
