{"cik": "1130713", "company": "OVERSTOCK.COM, INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-03", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nPlease consider the following risk factors carefully. If any one or more of the following risks were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations, and the market price of our securities could decrease significantly. Statements below to the effect that an event could or would harm our business (or have an adverse effect on our business or similar statements) mean that the event could or would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations, which in turn could or would have a material adverse effect on the market price of our securities. Although we have organized the risk factors below under headings to make them easier to read, many of the risks we face involve more than one type of risk. Consequently you should read all of the risk factors below carefully before making any decision to acquire or hold our securities.\nAny investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. Investors should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, and all other information in this Form 10-K and in any reports we file with the SEC after we file this Form 10-K, before deciding whether to purchase or hold our securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also become important factors that may harm our business. The occurrence of any of the risks described in this Form 10-K could harm our business. The trading price of our securities could decline due to any of these risks and uncertainties, and investors may lose part or all of their investment.\nRisks Related to Our Infrastructure, Cyber Security, Data Breach and Related Matters\nOur business depends on our Website, our mobile app, our network infrastructure and transaction-processing systems.\nAs an e-commerce company, we are completely dependent on our infrastructure and on the availability and reliability of the Internet and related systems. Any system interruption that results in the unavailability of our Website or our mobile app or reduced performance of our transaction systems could interrupt or substantially reduce our ability to conduct our business. We have experienced periodic systems interruptions due to server failure, power failure and intentional cyberattacks in the past, which we expect will continue to occur from time to time. Any failure or impairment of our infrastructure or of the availability of the Internet and related systems could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf the facility where substantially all of our computer and communications hardware is located fails, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nSubstantially all of our computer and communications hardware is located at a single facility. Our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks, cyber-attacks, acts of war, break-ins, earthquake and similar events. Our back-up facility is not adequate to support sales at a high level. Our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions, the occurrence of any of which could lead to interruptions, delays, loss of critical data or the inability to accept and fulfill customer orders. The occurrence of any of the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nNatural disasters, pandemics, and geo-political events could adversely affect our business.\nNatural disasters, weather conditions, pandemics, and geo-political events, including civil unrest or terrorist attacks, that affect us or our delivery services, suppliers, credit card processors or other service providers could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to cyber security risks and risks of data loss or other security breaches, and may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks and to respond to cyber incidents.\nOur business is entirely dependent on the secure operation of our Website and systems as well as the operation of the Internet generally. Our business involves the storage and transmission of users\u2019 proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, and to resulting claims, fines, and litigation. We have been subjected to a variety of cyberattacks. We may not have the resources or technical sophistication to defend against rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks. Cyber-attacks may target us, our customers, our suppliers, banks, credit card processors, delivery services, e-commerce in general or the communication infrastructure on which we depend. Actual or anticipated attacks and risks may cause us to incur substantial and increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third party experts and consultants. Any compromise of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur dependence on credit or debit card payments increases our risks.\nMost of our customers use credit cards to pay for their purchases. Under payment card rules and our contracts with our card processors, if we experience a breach of payment card information or fail to follow payment card industry security standards, even if there is no compromise of customer information, we could incur significant fines, higher transaction costs or lose our ability to give customers the option of using payment cards. If we were unable to accept payment cards, it would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur expansion into financial technology businesses and our acquisitions of registered broker dealers and related businesses increases our infrastructure, cyber security, data breach and related risks.\nAs we have expanded into financial technology businesses and have acquired registered broker dealers and related businesses, our infrastructure, cyber security, data breach and related risks have increased. See \u201cRisks Relating to Certain Specific Businesses, Investments in Businesses and Recent or Planned Changes to Our Business.\u201d\nRisks Related to Competition\nWe face intense competition and may not be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors.\nThe online retail market is evolving rapidly and intensely competitive. Barriers to entry are minimal, and current and new competitors can launch new websites at a relatively low cost. We currently compete with numerous competitors, including:\n\u2022\nonline retailers with or without discount departments, including AliExpress (part of the Alibaba Group), Amazon.com, eBay, and Rakuten.com (formerly Buy.com);\n\u2022\nonline specialty retailers such as Blue Nile, Bluefly, Houzz, Jet.com, Wayfair, Zappos.com, and Zulily;\n\u2022\nprivate sale sites such as Groupon, Living Social and Rue La La;\n\u2022\nfurniture specialists including Ashley Furniture, Bob\u2019s Discount Furniture, Havertys, Raymour & Flanigan and Rooms To Go;\n\u2022\ntraditional general merchandise and specialty retailers and liquidators including Barnes and Noble, Bed, Bath & Beyond, Best Buy, Costco Wholesale Corporation, Crate and Barrel, Ethan Allen, Gilt, Home Depot, HomeGoods, Hudson's Bay Company, IKEA, J.C. Penny Company, Kirkland's, Kohl's, Lands' End, Lowe's, Macy\u2019s, Nordstrom, Pier 1 Imports, Pottery Barn, Restoration Hardware, Ross Stores, Saks Fifth Avenue, Sears Holding Corporation, T.J. Maxx, Target Corporation, Wal-Mart and Williams-Sonoma, all of which also have an online presence; and\n\u2022\nliquidation e-tailers such as SmartBargains.\nThe intense and increasing competition we face from a wide variety of competitors, many of which have substantially greater resources than we do, and some of which are willing to incur losses in order to increase revenues, may result in our pricing of products or services below prices at which we can make a profit, may cause us to lose sales entirely, and may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur competitors are rapidly developing a wide variety of services and other offerings, and we may be unable to provide more competitive offerings.\nThe online retail market has become far more competitive as traditional and online retailers continue to develop and improve services that compete with our services. Many traditional manufacturers and retailers have added or improved their e-commerce offerings, and we expect that more will do so and that they will all continue to improve their offerings. Traditional and predominantly online retailers may create proprietary, store-based distribution and returns channels that we may be unable to match, and may also be able to create their own traditional distribution and delivery services. Amazon continues to open additional fulfillment centers and to increase its same-day delivery capabilities in an increasing number of metro areas as well as one and two-hour delivery capability on certain items in an increasing number of metro areas, and staffed pickup locations in certain high-density locations. Competitive pressures, including same-day and one and two-hour delivery capabilities, from Amazon and from any of our other competitors, many of whom have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do, affect us and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition to the types of retailers described above, we are competing with specialty firms in several areas, many of which focus exclusively or primarily on the business in which we are competing.\nIn addition to the types of retailers described above, in many areas we face competition from numerous other businesses, many of which may specialize in the type of business in which we are competing. Our furniture offerings compete with more than 100 online retail furniture websites, in addition to many more traditional furniture retail specialists. We face the risk that potential furniture and other customers will choose traditional retailers where they can physically examine products prior to purchase. Our Supplier Oasis service faces substantial competition from third party logistics providers as well as from Amazon and eBay and other e-commerce service providers having substantially greater experience and resources than we have. We are currently offering insurance products, and as such face competition from small and large established businesses with substantially more experience. An inability to compete in these areas could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur t\u00d8.com subsidiary is competing with a rapidly-growing group of companies in the financial industry as well as new entrants with significant resources from venture capital firms and other funding sources.\nOur majority-owned subsidiary t\u00d8.com, Inc. (formerly Medici, Inc.) is competing against a variety of companies with substantially greater financial resources and experience in financial technology. The number of competitors in this area and the resources being devoted to the area by competitors are growing rapidly. We may be unable to compete successfully against these competitors or others that may not yet have publicly announced their business plans in this area, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. See \u201cRisks relating to Certain Specific Businesses, Investments in Businesses and Recent or Planned Changes to our Business,\u201d below.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nAs an e-commerce company, we depend on a large number of other companies to perform functions critical to our ability to deliver products to our customers and to perform many of the related functions.\nWe depend on a large number of other companies, including a large number of independent partners whose products we offer for sale on our Website, to perform functions critical to our ability to deliver products to our customers and to perform many of the related functions. We depend on these partners to perform a number of traditional retail operations such as maintaining inventory, preparing merchandise for shipment to our customers and delivering purchased merchandise on a timely\nbasis, and also on the delivery services that we and they utilize. Difficulties with our significant partners or with any of the delivery services, regardless of the reason, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe depend upon our payment card processors and payment card associations.\nOur customers primarily use credit cards to buy from us. We are completely dependent upon our payment card processors to process the sales transactions and remit the proceeds to us. The payment card processors have the right to withhold funds otherwise payable to us to establish or increase reserves based on their assessment of the inherent risks of payment card processing and their assessment of the risks of processing our customers\u2019 payment cards at any time, and have done so from time to time in the past. We are also subject to payment card associations\u2019 operating rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers. If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers, process electronic funds transfers, or facilitate other types of online payments. In addition, events affecting our payment card processors, including cyber-attacks, Internet or other infrastructure or communications impairment or other events that could interrupt the normal operation of the payment card processors, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nImplementation of the EMV credit card standards in the U.S. may increase fraud efforts against U.S. online retailers, including us.\nCredit card issuers in the United States began replacing traditional credit cards with credit cards meeting the EMV (Europay, MasterCard and Visa) standards during 2015. Cards meeting the EMV standards contain a chip which makes the cards more difficult to counterfeit than the traditional magnetic stripe-only cards widely used in the U.S. However, to the extent that the EMV standards make physical card-duplication fraud more difficult, the new standards may drive more fraud efforts against online retailers, including us. Consequently, as an online retailer, we may be subject to increasing levels of fraudulent orders and other types of criminal activities. Increased levels of fraud and other criminal activities could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks associated with the suppliers from whom we or our fulfillment partners source products and the safety of those products could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe depend on our ability to access products from qualified suppliers in a timely and efficient manner. We rely primarily on our suppliers\u2019 representations of product content and quality. Concerns regarding product content or quality, or the safety of products that we offer, could adversely affect our financial performance. Further, if any product we sell were to cause physical injury or injury to property, the injured party or parties might bring claims against us. Any indemnity agreement we may have with the supplier may be inadequate or inapplicable, and any insurance coverage we may carry may not be adequate to cover claims that could be asserted. Even unsuccessful claims could result in the expenditure of funds and management time and could have a negative impact on our business. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe and many of our suppliers and fulfillment partners depend upon products manufactured internationally, and tariffs or other measures that increase the effective price of products imported into the United States could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe and many of our suppliers and fulfillment partners source a portion of the products we offer on our website from China and other countries. If the United States imposes tariffs or other measures that increase the price of products we or they import and that we offer on our website, the increased prices could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe depend upon third parties for all or substantially all of the services we offer.\nIn addition to the many third parties we rely on in connection with our sale and the delivery of products to our customers, we depend upon third parties for all or substantially all of the services we offer, including our insurance offerings, our consumer financing offerings, our car listings and our car-related services. Services offerings are inherently different from product offerings, and we may encounter difficulties with our services offerings that may be different from the types of issues we face with our product offerings. Any such difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Marketing\nOur business depends on effective marketing.\nWe depend on effective marketing and high customer traffic. From time to time, competitors may bid up the cost of certain marketing channels, such as paid keywords. At such times, we may reduce the amounts we spend in those marketing channels, which may lead to decreased visitors to our site, or we may pay the increased rates, which increases our expenses. If we are unable to develop, implement and maintain effective and efficient advertising and marketing programs, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely upon paid and natural search engines including Google, Bing, and Yahoo! to rank our product offerings. Our financial results may suffer if search engines change their ranking algorithms and our product offerings are ranked lower, and we may at times be subject to ranking penalties if the operators of search engines believe we are not in compliance with their guidelines.\nWe rely on paid and natural search engines to attract consumer interest in our product offerings. Potential and existing customers use search engines provided by search engine companies, including, but not limited to, Google, Bing, and Yahoo!, which use algorithms and other devices to provide users a natural ranked listing of relevant Internet sites matching a user\u2019s search criteria and specifications. Search engine companies change their natural search engine algorithms periodically, and our ranking in natural searches may be adversely affected by those changes, as has occurred from time to time. In addition, large marketplace websites and sites which aggregate marketplace sellers with a large product selection are becoming increasingly popular, and we may not be able to place our products on these sites to take advantage of their internal search platforms. Further, some shoppers may begin their searches at a competitor's website, and may not utilize traditional search engines at all. Our inability to place products on or access these sites may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business relies heavily on email, and reduced utilization of email in general and any restrictions on the sending of commercial email could have a material adverse effect our business.\nWe depend on email to promote our site and offerings. We provide daily emails to potential customers about our offerings, and email promotions are an important part of our marketing and help generate a substantial portion of our net revenue. If a significant portion of our target customers no longer utilize email, or if we are unable to effectively deliver email to our potential customers, our business, financial condition and operating results would be harmed. Anything, including legal or regulatory restrictions, that blocks, imposes restrictions on or imposes charges for the delivery of email could also harm our business. We also rely on social networking messaging services to send communications and to encourage customers to send communications, and anything that limits our ability or our customers\u2019 ability to utilize social networking services could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are experimenting with various ways to reduce the number of coupons we offer to our customers, which may have adversely affected our revenue growth and may continue to do so.\nAlthough our business has historically relied heavily on coupons to generate sales, we are experimenting with modifications to our coupon marketing. We believe that changes we have made to our coupon marketing in the past adversely affected our revenue growth, and that these and other changes we may make may continue to adversely affect our revenue growth. We have not yet achieved the results we are seeking, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so. If we are unable to generate sales using other marketing approaches at rates equal to or better than the rates we were generating through our coupon marketing, our revenue growth could be adversely affected or reversed, and our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nFraud Related Risks\nCredit card fraud and our response to it could adversely affect our business.\nWe routinely receive orders placed with fraudulent credit card data. If we fail to adequately control fraudulent credit card transactions it could reduce our net revenues and our gross profit or cause credit card or payment system companies to disallow their cards\u2019 use for customer payments on our website. We may suffer losses as a result of orders placed with fraudulent credit card data even if the associated financial institution approved payment of the orders. Under current credit card practices, we may be liable for fraudulent credit card transactions because we do not obtain a cardholder\u2019s signature. If we are unable to detect or control credit card fraud, claims against us for these transactions could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operation. Further, to the extent that our efforts to prevent fraudulent orders result in our inadvertent refusal to fill legitimate orders, we would lose the benefit of legitimate potential sales and risk the alienation of legitimate customers. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nTax and Regulatory Risks\nIf one or more states successfully assert that we should collect sales or other taxes on the sale of our merchandise or the merchandise of third parties that we offer for sale on our Website, or that we should pay commercial activity taxes, our business could be harmed.\nWe do not currently collect sales or other similar taxes on sales of goods into states where we have no duty to do so under federal court decisions construing applicable constitutional law. Certain jurisdictions are seeking payment of sales tax for sales we have made to customers in such jurisdictions or for payment of similar taxes or to impose sales tax collection obligations on us. To date we have been able to settle these claims without incurring material expenses. However, if any jurisdiction where we do not or did not collect sales or other taxes successfully asserts that we should do so or should have done so, or should otherwise have collected or paid other types of taxes, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn 2013 the United States Senate passed the Marketplace Fairness Act of 2013 (\u201cMFA\u201d), but it failed to pass in the House of Representatives. Efforts continue to enact similar legislation, which would permit qualifying states to force remote sellers like us to collect taxes in states where we have no physical presence. The enactment of legislation similar to the MFA could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nSeveral states have enacted laws requiring remote vendors to notify resident purchasers in those states of their obligation to pay a use tax on their purchases and, in some instances, to report untaxed purchases to the state tax authorities. Other states have enacted legislation to require retailers without a physical presence in the state to collect and remit state sales taxes if they engage in any activity in connection with the selling, leasing or delivery of tangible personal property or taxable services within the state. Additional states have recently introduced legislation, and we anticipate that additional states may enact similar laws, or other laws to force or encourage through economic pressures remote retailers to collect and remit sales tax. Such laws could harm our business by imposing notice burdens upon us, by requiring transaction notices that would adversely affect sales, or by discouraging customer purchases by requiring detailed purchase reporting. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nExisting or future government regulation could harm our business.\nWe are subject to regulation at the federal, state, local and international levels, including regulation relating to privacy, security, retention, transfer and use of personal user information and telemarketing laws. Increasing regulation may increase the cost of our business and may further restrict our marketing efforts. Existing laws, including those governing advertising, product labeling, product content requirements and product safety, may cause us to incur expenses. We may be subject to claims related to personal injury, death, environmental or property damage. We are periodically required to participate in product recalls. We may incur expense in connection with any of the foregoing or other matters or actions which may not be covered by any liability insurance we may carry. These current and future laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nSee \u201cRisks relating to Certain Specific Businesses, Investments in Businesses and Recent or Planned Changes to our Business,\u201d and \u201cRisks Related to our Preferred Stock,\u201d below.\nPublic statements we or our Chief Executive Officer, Patrick M. Byrne, have made or may make in the future may antagonize regulatory officials or others.\nWe and our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Patrick M. Byrne, have from time to time made public statements regarding our or his beliefs about matters of public interest, including statements regarding naked short selling and regulatory capture. Some of those public statements have been critical of the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulatory agencies. These public statements may have consequences for us, whether as a result of increased regulatory scrutiny or otherwise. Additionally, other officers may make public statements that could have adverse consequences and these statements could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nMacroeconomic Risks\nEconomic factors, including our increasing exposure to the U.S. housing industry, may adversely affect our financial performance.\nEconomic conditions, particularly any weakness in the United States housing market, may adversely affect our financial performance. Over the last few years the percentage of our sales from home and garden products has increased\nsubstantially. We believe that our sales of home and garden products are affected by the strength of the U.S. housing industry, and that downturns in the U.S. housing industry would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nDecreases in discretionary consumer spending may have an adverse effect on us.\nA substantial portion of the products and services we offer are products or services that consumers may view as discretionary items rather than necessities. As a result, our results of operations are sensitive to changes in macro-economic conditions that impact consumer spending, including discretionary spending. Difficult macro-economic conditions, particularly high levels of unemployment or underemployment, also impact our customers\u2019 ability to obtain consumer credit. Other factors, including consumer confidence, employment levels, interest rates, tax rates, consumer debt levels, and fuel and energy costs could reduce consumer spending or change consumer purchasing habits. Slowdowns in the U.S. or global economy, or an uncertain economic outlook, could materially adversely affect consumer spending habits and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks of Changes and Unpredictability in the Industry and in Our Business\nIf we do not respond to rapid technological changes, our services could become obsolete, and we could lose customers.\nThe Internet and the online commerce industry are changing rapidly. To remain competitive, we must continue to enhance and improve the functionality and features of our e-commerce businesses. If we fail to do so, or if we fail to remain competitive when our competitors develop new technologies or new industry standards and practices emerge, our Website, our mobile app and our proprietary technology and systems could become obsolete. Our failure to respond to technological change and to remain competitive would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have an evolving business model, which increases the complexity of our business.\nOur business model has evolved in the past and continues to do so. In prior years we have added additional types of services and product offerings and in some cases we have modified or discontinued those offerings. We intend to continue to try to offer additional types of products or services, and we do not know whether any of them will be successful. From time to time we have also modified aspects of our business model relating to our product mix and the mix of direct/partner sourcing of the products we offer. We do not know whether these or any other modifications will be successful. The additions and modifications to our business have increased the complexity of our business and placed significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions. Future additions to or modifications of our business are likely to have similar effects. Further, any new business or website we launch that is not favorably received by consumers could damage our reputation or our brand. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAny acquisitions we make will increase costs and regulatory and integration risks.\nFrom time to time we may acquire other businesses. Integrating an acquired business involves a number of risks and financial, managerial and operational challenges. We have incurred significant expenses in connection with acquisitions we have made in the past, and may incur additional expenses in connection with those acquisitions or in connection with other acquisitions we may make in the future. Our overall profitability would be adversely affected if our investments and expenses associated with any investments we have made or may make in the future are not justified by the revenues and profits, if any, that are derived from such investments. Further, acquisitions may also create a need for additional accounting, tax, compliance, documentation, risk management and internal control procedures, and may require us to hire additional personnel to implement, perform and/or monitor such procedures. To the extent our procedures are not adequate to appropriately implement, perform and/or monitor all necessary procedures relating to any new or expanded business, we could be exposed to a material loss or regulatory sanction.\nInternational Risks\nWe are attempting to expand our international business, which may cause our business to become increasingly susceptible to numerous risks and challenges that could affect our profitability.\nWe sell products in international markets, and are attempting to expand into some of these markets. International sales and transactions, and our efforts to expand them, are subject to inherent risks and challenges that could adversely affect our profitability, including:\n\u2022the need to develop new supplier and manufacturer relationships;\n\u2022\nthe need to comply with additional U.S. and foreign laws and regulations to the extent applicable, including but not limited to, restrictions on advertising practices, regulations governing online services, regulations governing or prohibiting the use of cryptocurrency such as bitcoin, restrictions on importation of specified or proscribed items, importation quotas, consumer protection laws, laws regarding intellectual property rights, laws dealing with consumer and data protection, privacy, encryption, and restrictions on pricing or discounts;\n\u2022changes in international laws, regulatory requirements, taxes and tariffs;\n\u2022geopolitical events, such as war and terrorist attacks;\n\u2022\nour limited experience with different local cultures and standards;\n\u2022the risk that the products we offer may not appeal to customers in international markets; and\n\u2022the additional resources and management attention required for such expansion.\nTo date, most of our international sales have been denominated in U.S. dollars, and we have not had significant foreign currency risk on those sales. However, in the future, gains and losses on the conversion of foreign payments into U.S. dollars may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations and fluctuating exchange rates could cause reduced gross revenues and/or gross profit percentages from non-dollar-denominated international sales. Additionally, penalties for non-compliance with laws applicable to international business and trade, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nForeign data protection, privacy and other laws and regulations are different and often more restrictive than those in the United States. Our risk of non-compliance with applicable foreign data protection laws and regulations increases as we continue our international expansion. We may need to change and limit the way we use consumer information in operating our business and may have difficulty maintaining a single operating model that is compliant. Compliance with such laws and regulations will result in additional costs and may necessitate changes to our business practices and divergent operating models, which may adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nIn July 2016, the European Commission adopted the EU-US Privacy Shield, which provides a new compliance framework for US organizations that import personal data from Europe. We have complied with the Privacy Shield self-certification procedures. Among other things, Privacy Shield certification requires that we amend our existing contracts with third parties involved with the transfer of personal data to bring them into compliance within a nine-month grace period after our certification date. If we are unable to do so or are otherwise unable to comply with the Privacy Shield requirements, we could incur additional costs and operational difficulties relating to our efforts in Europe.\nOur foreign brand domain name may cause confusion.\nIn 2010, we attempted to associate our brand globally with the domain address: www.O.co. Following a period of testing for the O.co brand and domain address, we returned to the Overstock.com name as our primary brand domestically because domestic consumer acceptance did not occur as quickly as we had hoped. We continue to use the O.co address and brand outside of the United States and plan to use it or another domain address and brand domestically as well. The use of Overstock.com or O.co may not gain acceptance or have success in foreign markets, and other domain addresses or brands we may use domestically may not be successful. Any such difficulties with any of our brands could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Our Headquarters\nWe own the land on which we built our new headquarters, and consequently have environmental and other risks, and may incur environmental expense and liabilities under the environmental indemnity agreement we entered into in connection with our credit facility.\nIn 2014 our wholly-owned subsidiary O.com Land, LLC purchased land near Salt Lake City, Utah on which we have built our new headquarters. The land is part of the Midvale SLAG Superfund Site (\u201cSite\u201d), a former Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (\"CERCLA\") superfund site that was remediated pursuant to CERCLA prior to O.com Land\u2019s purchase. O.com Land, LLC is required to follow certain requirements of CERCLA and the consent decree governing remediation of the Site, and its failure to do so could expose us to material environmental liabilities. Further, in connection with the credit facility we entered into with U.S. Bank and other banks, we entered into a broad environmental indemnity agreement pursuant to which we agreed to indemnify U.S. Bank and other banks and other persons against a broad array of potential environmental claims, liabilities and exposures relating to the property. Any such environmental liabilities, and any liabilities under the environmental indemnity agreement, could be material and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Indebtedness and Potential Stock Repurchases\nIn connection with the construction of our new headquarters, we have entered into a syndicated senior secured credit facility, which requires us to maintain compliance with financial and other covenants.\nIn connection with the construction of our new headquarters we entered into a syndicated senior secured credit facility with U.S. Bank and other banks that provided us with construction financing of $45.8 million. The facility converted to an approximately 6.75-year term loan on January 1, 2017. We will need to maintain compliance with the requirements governing the facility, including compliance with financial and other covenants, certain of which may be subject to events outside of our control. We have pledged substantially all of our assets to secure our obligations under the credit facility. If we fail to comply with the terms of the credit facility, the failure could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and business.\nWe have entered into long-term interest rate swaps that expire in October 2023.\nIn connection with the syndicated senior secured credit facility described above, we entered into interest rate swaps with U.S. Bank and Compass Bank. The interest rate swaps are intended to manage the interest rate risk on the indebtedness we incurred under the credit agreement. Regardless of the status of that indebtedness, we will remain liable for payments due under the swaps unless we settle them. If we were to settle the swaps at a time when interest rates have fallen (relative to the swaps' inception), the price to settle the swaps could be material. Any such adverse developments could result in material liabilities and expense and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have incurred substantial indebtedness.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had incurred secured indebtedness of approximately $45.8 million under our syndicated senior secured credit facility, and we had total liabilities of $312.1 million. This indebtedness increases our business risks substantially, including our vulnerability to industry downturns and competitive pressures. Further, the loan agreement and related agreements governing the credit facility contain numerous requirements, including financial and other covenants. If we are unable to maintain compliance with all of them, we will be in default, the consequences of which could materially harm our business. Further, to the extent that we incur additional indebtedness, we may be subject to additional requirements. The degree to which we are ultimately leveraged could materially and adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, acquisitions or other purposes. Our ability to meet our debt service obligations will be dependent upon our future performance, which will be subject to financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control.\nOur Board has authorized a stock repurchase program and repurchases under the program would reduce our liquidity and increase our risks.\nIn May 2015, our Board authorized a stock repurchase program. In January 2017, we repurchased approximately 604,000 shares of our common stock for $10 million. We may repurchase additional shares of our outstanding common stock for up to $15 million at any time through December 31, 2017 under our existing repurchase program. Further, our Board could authorize additional repurchases. Any such repurchases would reduce our liquidity and could increase our vulnerability to industry downturns and competitive pressures. A material decrease in our liquidity could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations.\nOur ability to generate cash flow from operations to make interest and principal payments on our debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by a range of economic, competitive and business factors. We cannot control many of these factors, including general economic conditions and the health of the Internet retail industry. If our operations do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy our debt service obligations and all of our other obligations, we may need to borrow additional funds to make these payments or undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our debt, or reducing or delaying capital investments and other expenses. Additional funds or alternative financing may not be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or obtain additional funds or alternative financing on acceptable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to our Finance and Accounting Systems and Estimates\nWe may need to implement additional finance and accounting systems, procedures and controls as we grow our business and organization and to satisfy new reporting requirements.\nWe are required to comply with a variety of reporting, accounting and other rules and regulations. Compliance with existing requirements is expensive. We will have to ensure that the reporting, accounting, records maintenance and other systems in place at the financial technology company and broker dealers we acquired are compliant and adequate. These and future requirements may increase our costs and require additional management time and resources. We may need to implement additional finance and accounting systems, procedures and controls to satisfy our reporting requirements. If our internal control over financial reporting is determined to be ineffective, such failure could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, negatively affect the market price of our common stock, subject us to regulatory investigations and penalties, and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nChanges in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial results.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business, including but not limited to revenue recognition, estimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities (including allowances for returns, credit card chargebacks, doubtful accounts and obsolete and damaged inventory), internal-use software and website development (acquired and developed internally), accounting for income taxes, valuation of intangible assets and goodwill, stock-based compensation and loss contingencies, are complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by our management. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance, and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur income tax provisions and the amounts we reserve for tax contingencies are estimates and are subject to variations and adjustments. The amounts we ultimately pay may exceed the amounts estimated or accrued.\nOur quarterly tax provision, and our quarterly estimate of our annual effective tax rate, is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variability in accurately predicting our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, changes in how we do business, changes in law, regulations, and administrative practices, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Additionally, our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre-tax income is relatively low. We are subject to audits by a number of tax authorities. The timing of the resolution of income, sales and other tax examinations is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts we have accrued. It is possible that within the next 12 months we will receive assessments by various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of income tax examinations in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments or settlements may result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on prior years\u2019 tax filings. The volatility of our quarterly tax provision or the resolution of matters related to our tax contingencies could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe have reversed the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets, and we may not be able to realize these assets in the future. Our deferred tax assets may also be subject to additional valuation allowances, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nFrom our inception to December 31, 2013, we established a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets, primarily due to realized losses and uncertainty regarding our future taxable income. Determining whether a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is appropriate requires significant judgment and an evaluation of all positive and negative evidence. At each reporting period, we assess the need for, or the sufficiency of, a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2013, based on the weight of all the positive and negative evidence (primarily our estimate of future taxable income), we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would realize our net deferred tax assets based upon future taxable income, and we reversed the valuation allowance at December 31, 2013. Our estimates of future taxable income are based primarily on historical performance, but also include estimates and assumptions and external data, some of which are subject to significant judgment. If our actual taxable income differs significantly from our estimates, we may need to reestablish a valuation allowance for some or all of our deferred tax assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nRisks Related to our Holdings of Precious Metals, Cryptocurrencies, Cash and Short-Term Investments\nWe may be adversely affected by fluctuations in precious metal prices.\nAt December 31, 2016 our investment in precious metals was $9.9 million. Our financial results may be adversely affected by declines in the price of precious metals. Our investment consists of actual precious metals, rather than financial instruments. We store our precious metals off-site in a third party facility. Consequently, we are also subject to the risks of physical storage with a third party that we do not control. Any loss of these assets or substantial decline in their value could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur decision to accept and hold cryptocurrency, such as bitcoins, may subject us to exchange risk and additional tax and regulatory requirements.\nIn January 2014, we began accepting bitcoins as a form of payment for purchases on our Website. Bitcoin is not considered legal tender or backed by any government, and it has experienced price volatility, technological glitches and various law enforcement and regulatory interventions. In September 2014, we began accepting bitcoin internationally. The use of cryptocurrency such as bitcoin has been prohibited or effectively prohibited in some countries. If we fail to comply with regulations or prohibitions applicable to us, we could face regulatory or other enforcement actions and potential fines and other consequences. From time to time we also hold bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies directly, and we have exchange rate risk on the amounts we hold as well as the risks that regulatory or other developments may adversely affect the value of the cryptocurrencies we hold. The uncertainties regarding legal and regulatory requirements relating to cryptocurrencies or transactions utilizing cryptocurrencies, as well as potential accounting and tax issues, or other requirements relating to cryptocurrencies could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are subject to a risk of loss based upon the solvency of the financial institutions in which they are maintained.\nWe maintain the majority of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in accounts with a small number of major financial institutions within the United States, in the form of demand deposits, money market accounts, time deposits, U.S. Treasury Bills and other short-term investments. Our deposits in these institutions are generally substantially in excess of the amounts of insurance provided by the FDIC, and some deposits may not be covered by insurance at all. If any of these institutions were to become insolvent or subject to regulatory action, we could lose some, or all, of such deposits, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property Rights and Disputes\nWe may be unable to protect our proprietary technology and to obtain trademark protection for our marks.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon the protection of our software and other proprietary intellectual property rights. We may be unable to protect it, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Further, we may not be able to secure protection for our service marks or trademarks in the United States or elsewhere as we expand internationally. Our competitors might adopt product or service marks similar to our marks, or might try to prevent us from using our marks. Any claim by another party against us or customer confusion related to our trademarks, or our failure to obtain trademark registration, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may not be able to enforce protection of our intellectual property rights under the laws of other countries.\nWe sell products internationally and consequently we are subject to risks of doing business internationally, including uncertainty regarding liability for the listings and other content provided by our users, and differing intellectual property laws, which may provide insufficient protection for our intellectual property. Any such difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties.\nWe have been and will continue to be subject to claims that we have infringement the intellectual property rights of others. Any such claims may result in significant expenditure of financial and managerial resources, and the payment of damages or settlement amounts. Additionally, we may be prohibited from using software or business processes we currently use or may need to use in the future, or required to obtain licenses from third parties, even though such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. Any such difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business and reputation may be harmed by the offering or sale of pirated, counterfeit or illegal items by third parties, and by intellectual property litigation.\nWe routinely receive allegations that items we offer or sell infringe third party intellectual property rights. Further, we may be unable to prevent third parties from offering and selling unlawful goods or goods that are improperly labelled or otherwise not compliant with applicable regulations, and we may be subject to allegations of civil or criminal liability for unlawful or noncompliant offerings by third parties through our Website. Costs we incur relating to allegations of infringement or the sale of unlawful goods could harm our business and could require us to change our methods of doing business or require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements, if available. Any of the foregoing could damage our reputation, diminish the value of our brand name, and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Certain Specific Businesses, Investments in Businesses and Recent or Planned Changes to our Business\nWe have acquired the assets and business of a financial technology company and two registered broker-dealers; we have limited experience with the operation of a fintech company or of a registered broker-dealer, and the businesses that we are pursuing through our Medici initiatives are novel and could result in material write-offs.\nIn August 2015, we acquired the assets and business of a financial technology (\"fintech\") company and in January 2016, after receiving FINRA approval, we acquired two registered broker-dealers (our \u201cbroker-dealer subsidiaries\u201d) that were affiliated with the fintech company. We subsequently hired all or substantially all of the employees of the fintech company. However, we have limited experience with the operation of a fintech company or of registered broker-dealers, and are dependent upon the employees for the expertise necessary to operate the fintech company and the broker-dealer subsidiaries. Further, we have recently issued publicly-traded securities traded exclusively on a registered alternative trading system operated by one of our majority-owned subsidiaries, the ownership of which is tracked on a distributed ledger. See \u201cRisks Related to our Preferred Stock,\u201d below. We are also working on other potential financial applications of distributed ledger, or blockchain, technology. All of these are areas in which we do not have substantial experience, and all of them are subject to the risks of new and novel businesses, including technical and operational risk, financial risk, regulatory and legal risk, and reputational risk. In addition, we face the risk that we may be unable to market, license or sell our technology successfully or profitably. Any significant problems we encounter with these projects could have a material adverse effect on our business. Further, we review our acquired assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. As described further in Item 15 of Part IV, \"Financial Statements\"-Note 2. Accounting Policies, contained in the \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,\" we will write off these amounts as necessary. Any such write-offs could be material.\nWe have acquired registered broker-dealers, which are subject to extensive regulation.\nThe broker-dealers we acquired in January 2016 are subject to regulation, examination and disciplinary action by the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d) and state securities regulators, as well as other governmental authorities and self-regulatory organizations (\u201cSROs\u201d) with which they are registered or licensed or of which they are members. The broker-dealers are also subject to rules and regulations relating to the prevention and detection of money laundering, privacy and data protection laws and regulations, and substantial other regulatory requirements. Any failure to comply with all applicable regulations, and any regulatory proceeding or civil or criminal action against any of the broker-dealers that we have acquired, or any of their associated persons, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Further, any failure to identify and successfully manage conflicts of interest or to implement appropriate policies or procedures could subject the broker-dealers or us to disciplinary sanctions or litigation or could harm our reputation. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur investment in Bitt Inc. may expose us to risks under laws and regulations with which we do not have significant experience.\nIn 2016, we acquired an approximately 11% equity interest in Bitt, Inc., a startup company based in Barbados, that is pursuing a variety of digital currency transfer and payment businesses in the Caribbean. Virtually every state in the U.S. regulates money transmitters and money services businesses. In some states the licensing requirements and regulations expressly cover companies engaged in digital currency activities; in other states it is not clear whether or how the existing laws and regulations apply to digital currency activities. Further, U.S. federal law requires registration of most such businesses with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (\"FinCEN\"). These licenses and registrations subject companies to various anti-money laundering, know-your-customer, record-keeping, reporting and capital and bonding requirements, limitations on the investment of customer funds, and inspection by state and federal regulatory agencies. Under U.S. federal law, it is a crime for a person, entity or business that is required to be registered with FinCEN or licensed in any state to fail to do so, even if the\nperson, entity or business was unaware of the licensing requirement. Further, under U.S. federal law, anyone who owns all or part of an unlicensed money transmitting business is subject to civil and criminal penalties. The business in which we have invested has represented to us that it has not taken any action that could subject it to registration with FinCEN or to the licensing requirements in any state and has agreed that it will not do so until it has become properly licensed in all required states and registered with FinCEN. However, if the business makes an error, even inadvertently, we could be subject to potential civil and criminal penalties as a result. Any such penalties, or even the allegation of criminal activities, could have a material adverse effect on us and our business. Further, as described under Governmental Regulation, all of our foreign business activities expose us to a variety of risks, including risks under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\nWe may be required to write off amounts relating to our investments in startup businesses.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had invested approximately $14.6 million in several companies that are in the startup or development stages. During 2016, we recognized a $2.9 million impairment loss on one of these investments, which decreased the carrying amount of our cost method investments to $11.8 million. These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. Additionally, since several of our investments are in the early startup or development stages, even if their technology or products are viable, they may not be able to obtain the capital or resources necessary to successfully bring their technology or products to market. Furthermore, we have no assurance that the technology or products of our investees would be successful, even if they were brought to market. We will write off additional amounts related to these investments as necessary, and any such write-offs could be material.\nOur car listing service may be subject to a variety of regulatory requirements and risks.\nMany states and other jurisdictions, including Utah, where we are located, have regulations governing the conduct of car sellers and public advertising for car sales. Generally, these regulations apply to the sellers rather than to a company through which the advertising is done. Sellers are often subject to \u201ctruth in advertising\u201d laws. We have no ability to know whether the information sellers provide is correct. While our site terms and conditions of usage prohibit unlawful acts, we cannot assure that sellers will comply with all laws and regulations applicable to them and their transactions. Further, like our shopping business, our car listing service is subject to most of the same laws and regulations that apply to other companies conducting business on and off the Internet. Any negative publicity we receive regarding any allegations of unlawful or deceptive conduct may damage our reputation, our ability to attract new customers to our main shopping site, and our brand name generally. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur Supplier Oasis offering, including its fulfillment services, faces competition from other distribution networks and will require substantial resources.\nWe offer Supplier Oasis, a single integration point through which partners can manage their products, inventory and sales channels, which includes multi-channel fulfillment services to sellers, suppliers, and partners. The marketplace for these services is highly competitive, and many of our current and potential competitors in this area have greater brand recognition, longer operating histories, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. Our continued development of Supplier Oasis may require substantial investments over a lengthy period of time. Further, most of the risks applicable to our business generally are also applicable to the business of Supplier Oasis. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenues and gross profits from Supplier Oasis, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur Farmers Market offering faces competition from a variety of competitors.\nWe offer Farmers Market, a tab within our Website from which our customers, in certain locations, can order locally grown fresh produce and other food products. Farmers Market competes with a wide variety of businesses nationwide, many of which have greater brand recognition, longer operating histories, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. Our continued development of Farmers Market may involve delivery and other issues that may be different from those we face in connection with the sale and delivery of non-perishable products. The sale of food products is highly regulated, both by health and safety regulations and by regulations governing labeling. Further, most of the risks applicable to our business generally are also applicable to our Farmers Market business. Any significant difficulties we encounter with our Farmers Market offering could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur insurance offerings face competition from traditional insurance brokers and direct insurance marketing organizations.\nWe offer a tab within our website that connects our customers to live quotes for insurance for vehicle, residential and small businesses on our Website. The insurance business is highly competitive, and many of our current and potential\ncompetitors in this area have greater brand recognition, longer operating histories, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. Further, most of the risks applicable to our business generally are also applicable to our insurance offerings business. Any significant difficulties we encounter with our insurance offerings could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Litigation\nWe are routinely involved in substantial litigation.\nFrom time to time we receive claims and become subject to lawsuits involving consumer protection, employment, intellectual property and other matters related to the conduct and operation of our business and the sale of products on our Website, including claims by regulators and by customers. In addition, we have in the past been and in the future may be, involved in substantial litigation, including litigation regarding the constitutionality of certain state tax laws, in which we are the plaintiff. Any such litigation, whether as plaintiff or defendant, may be costly and time consuming and could divert management and key personnel from our regular business operations. An unfavorable resolution of any such matter could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nThe issuance of our Series A Preferred Stock and our Series B Preferred Stock could adversely affect the holders of our common stock in some circumstances.\nOur issuance in December 2016 of our Series A Preferred Stock and our Series B Preferred Stock (collectively sometimes called the \u201cPreferred Stock\u201d) could adversely affect the holders of our common stock in some circumstances. See \u201cRisks Related to our Preferred Stock - The issuance of our Series A Preferred Stock and our Series B Preferred Stock could adversely affect the holders of our common stock in some circumstances,\u201d below.\nThe price of our common stock and any other securities may be volatile and you may lose all or a part of your investment.\nThe market price of our common stock historically has been subject to significant fluctuations. These fluctuations could continue. It is possible that in future periods our results of operations may be below the expectations of investors and any analysts. If this occurs, the market price of our securities may decline substantially. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business and particularly on our ability to raise capital.\nOur quarterly operating results are volatile and may adversely affect the market price of our securities.\nOur future revenues and operating results have varied in the past and may continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are outside our control, and any of which could harm our business. As a result, we believe that quarterly comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that you should not rely on the results of one quarter as an indication of our future performance. In addition to the other risk factors described in this report, additional factors that have caused and/or could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate and in turn affect the market price of our securities include:\n\u2022\nincreases in the cost of advertising and changes in our sales and marketing expenditures;\n\u2022\nour inability to retain existing customers or encourage repeat purchases;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which our existing and future marketing campaigns are successful;\n\u2022\nprice competition that results in losses or lower profit margins;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the expansion of our business operations and infrastructure;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of our purchases of inventory;\n\u2022\nour inability to manage distribution operations or provide adequate levels of customer service;\n\u2022\nincreases in the cost of fuel and transportation;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully implement technology changes or to integrate operations and technologies from acquisitions or other business combinations;\n\u2022\nour efforts to offer new lines of products and services; and\n\u2022\nour ability to attract users to our shopping and other sites.\nAny of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur operating results may fluctuate depending on the season, and such fluctuations may affect the market price of our securities.\nWe have experienced and expect to continue to experience significant fluctuations in our operating results because of seasonal fluctuations in traditional retail patterns. Our gross revenues have historically been significantly higher in the fourth calendar quarter of each year than in the following quarters due primarily to increased shopping activity during the holiday season. Further, we generally increase our inventories substantially in anticipation of holiday season shopping activity, which has a negative effect on our cash flow. Securities analysts and investors may inaccurately estimate the effects of seasonality on our results of operations in one or more future quarters and, consequently, our operating results may fall below expectations, causing the market price of our securities to decline. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nSales by our significant stockholders could have an adverse effect on the market price of our stock.\nSeveral of our stockholders own significant percentages of our common stock. If one or more of our large stockholders were to sell all or a portion of their holdings of our common stock, the market price of our common stock could be negatively impacted. The effect of such sales, or of significant percentages of our stock being offered or made available for sale, could result in strong downward pressure on our stock price. Investors should be aware that they could experience significant volatility in our stock if any one or more of such stockholders were to decide to sell all or a portion of their holdings of our common stock at once or within a short period of time. In addition, the transfer of ownership of a significant portion of our outstanding shares within a three-year period could adversely affect our ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable net income. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and you may lose the entire amount of your investment in our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. We intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth. Therefore, you will not receive any funds without selling your shares. We cannot assure that you will receive a positive return on your investment when you sell your shares or that you will not lose the entire amount of your investment.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions among other things:\n\u2022\npermit the board of directors to establish the number of directors;\n\u2022\nprovide that only one-third of our board of directors is elected at each of our annual meetings of stockholders (and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors);\n\u2022\nmean that directors may be removed by the affirmative vote of the holders of the outstanding shares of common stock only \u201cfor cause;\u201d\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that our board could use to implement a stockholder rights plan (also known as a \u201cpoison pill\u201d);\n\u2022\neliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nprovide that the board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements, including specific requirements as to the timing, form and content of a stockholder\u2019s notice, for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nprovide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the board of directors, the chairman of the board, the chief executive officer or the president; and\n\u2022\nprovide that stockholders are permitted to amend the bylaws only with the approval of the holders of sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the voting power of outstanding capital stock entitled to vote at an election of directors.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company. In general, Section 203 prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d for a period of three years following the date the person became an interested stockholder, subject to certain exceptions.\nOur board of directors could accelerate the vesting of outstanding restricted stock units upon a sale of the company or otherwise, which could result in an increase in the number of shares outstanding.\nOur board has granted, and in the future expects to make additional grants, of restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d) to certain of our employees and directors. Upon vesting, one share of our common stock is issued for every RSU held. Under the terms of these grants, the board could determine to accelerate the vesting of RSUs in the event of a sale of our company or otherwise, which would result in an increase in the number of shares outstanding, and would dilute shareholders\u2019 ownership of our company. Although the number of RSUs outstanding changes frequently, the aggregate amount outstanding as of December 31, 2016 was 2.2% of the number of shares of common stock outstanding.\nWe have issued and in the future may again issue preferred stock as authorized by our amended and restated certificate of incorporation without further stockholder approval for purposes unrelated to any stockholder rights plan, and any such preferred stock could entitle the holders to rights superior to those of the holders of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board to designate and issue preferred stock on such terms as may be approved by the Board without further stockholder approval. In addition to the possibility that the Board could do so in connection with the adoption of a stockholder rights plan as described above, the Board has done so and could do so again for a variety of other purposes. See \u201cRisks Related to our Preferred Stock,\u201d below.\nThe price of our stock may be vulnerable to manipulation.\nThe practice of \u201cabusive naked short selling\u201d places our stock at risk for manipulative attacks by large investment pools and prime brokers. Abusive naked short selling is the practice by which short sellers place large short sell orders for shares without first borrowing the shares to be sold, or without having first adequately located such shares and arranged for a firm contract to borrow such shares prior to the delivery date set to close the sale. While selling broker dealers are by rule required to deliver shares to close a transaction by a certain date, and while purchasing broker-dealers are obligated by rule to purchase the sold quantity of shares when they are not delivered to close the sale, these rules are often ignored. Abusive naked short selling has a depressive effect on share prices when it is allowed to persist because the economic effect of abusive naked short selling is the oversupply of counterfeit stock to the market. We believe the regulations designed to address this abusive practice are both inadequately structured and inadequately enforced. Consequently, we believe that without the enactment of adequate regulations and the enforcement necessary to curb these abuses, the manipulations achieved through abusive naked short selling are likely to continue. We believe that our stock has been subject to these abusive practices by those attempting to manipulate its price downward. To the extent that our stock is subject to these practices in the future, our stock may be more volatile than it might otherwise be and/or may trade at prices below those that might prevail in the absence of such abuses.\nIn the past, our stock has consistently been on the Regulation SHO threshold list.\nRegulation SHO requires the stock exchanges to publish daily a list of companies whose stock has failures-to-deliver above a certain threshold. It also requires mandatory close-outs for open fail-to-deliver positions in threshold securities persisting for over 13 days. In the past our common stock frequently appeared on the Regulation SHO threshold list for extended and continuous periods and in the past our stock has been on the list for more trading days than any other company.\nWe generally have not received significant coverage by securities analysts, and the lack of coverage may adversely affect our share price and trading volume.\nWe generally have not received significant coverage by securities analysts, and the lack of coverage may adversely affect our share price and trading volume. The lack of coverage may cause our share price or trading volume to be lower than they might be if more analysts covered us.\nRisks Related to our Preferred Stock\nThe issuance of our Series A Preferred Stock and our Series B Preferred Stock could adversely affect the holders of our common stock in some circumstances.\nIn December 2016, we issued shares of our Blockchain Voting Series A Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries A Preferred\u201d) and our Voting Series B Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries B Preferred,\u201d and together with the Series A Preferred, collectively sometimes called the \u201cPreferred Stock\u201d) in a registered rights offering (the \u201crights offering\u201d). The Preferred Stock could adversely affect the holders of our common stock in some circumstances. Except as required by law, the Preferred Stock will vote with the common stock on all matters submitted to a vote of the common stock, with holders of the Preferred Stock having one vote for each share of Preferred Stock held. As of February 2, 2017, the 695,898 issued shares of Preferred Stock constituted approximately 2.7% of the total number of shares of the Preferred Stock and the common stock, taken together. The Preferred Stock ranks senior to the common stock with respect to dividends. Holders of the Preferred Stock will be entitled to an annual cash dividend equal to $0.16 per share of Preferred Stock, in preference to any dividend payment to the holders of the common stock. Holders of the Preferred Stock are also entitled to participate in any cash dividends we pay to the holders of the common stock and are also entitled to participate in any non-cash dividends we pay to holders of the common stock, subject to different treatment if we effect a stock dividend, stock split or combination of the common stock. The Preferred Stock will rank on a parity with the common stock with respect to rights upon our liquidation, winding up or dissolution. If we are a party to any merger or consolidation in which the common stock is changed into or exchanged for stock or other securities of any other person (or the Company) or cash or any other property (or a right to receive the foregoing), we will be required to use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause each outstanding share of the Preferred Stock to be treated as if such share were an additional outstanding share of common stock in connection with any such transaction.\nThe Series A Preferred and the t\u00d8 Platform are novel, and the use of the PRO Securities ATS utilizing the t\u00d8 Platform for trading public digital securities was untested prior to the December 2016 closing of the offering of the Series A Preferred.\nTrades in non-digital publicly traded securities currently take place through the continuous net settlement system operated by The Depositary Trust Company (\u201cDTC\u201d) and generally settle on the third day following the day on which the purchase and sale commitments are made. This delayed settlement model is the current standard in the United States for the sale and settlement of publicly traded securities, all of which are currently non-digital. The Series A Preferred does not trade or settle through the traditional system; rather, shares of Series A Preferred trade exclusively on a registered alternative trading system (the \u201cPRO Securities ATS\u201d) operated by our indirect majority-owned subsidiary PRO Securities LLC (\u201cPRO Securities\u201d) utilizing technology known as the t\u00d8 Issuance and Trading Platform (the \u201ct\u00d8 Platform\u201d). Unlike trades through the traditional system, trades of the Series A Preferred settle on the trade date. The t\u00d8 Platform is a recent development, licensed by PRO Securities from our majority-owned subsidiary t\u00d8.com, Inc., formerly named Medici, Inc. (\u201ct\u00d8.com\u201d), and the t\u00d8 Platform had not been tested with public trading of digital securities prior to the closing of the offering of the Series A Preferred in December 2016. Consequently, investors in the Series A Preferred bear the risks of investing in a novel type of security that trades exclusively on a novel type of trading platform and that is subject to a number of unusual restrictions, as well as the risks of investing in our business. Any failure of the PRO Securities ATS or of the t\u00d8 Platform to perform as expected could have a material adverse effect on holders\u2019 ability to sell the Series A Preferred.\nThe technology on which the t\u00d8 Platform depends has been developed by our majority-owned subsidiary, t\u00d8.com, and is licensed by its subsidiary, PRO Securities, and the Series A Preferred depends on both t\u00d8.com and on PRO Securities, neither of which has substantial resources.\nt\u00d8.com is a majority-owned subsidiary of ours and owns 100% of the equity interest in PRO Securities. t\u00d8.com licenses the t\u00d8 Platform to PRO Securities, and PRO Securities operates the PRO Securities ATS. t\u00d8.com also licenses the t\u00d8 Platform to the Company for the Company\u2019s use in connection with the Series A Preferred. Neither t\u00d8.com nor PRO Securities has substantial resources. PRO Securities had net capital of approximately $24,141 at December 31, 2016. Neither t\u00d8.com nor PRO Securities has any legally binding commitment from any person, including the Company, to contribute additional capital or to make any loan to either of them. If any one or more of the Company, t\u00d8.com or PRO Securities were to be unable to fund its operations in the future, or if any one or more of the Company, t\u00d8.com or PRO Securities were to become the subject of a bankruptcy or other insolvency proceeding, PRO Securities might be unable to continue to operate the t\u00d8 Platform, and the Series A Preferred could be materially adversely affected. In any such event, holders of our capital stock, including the Series A Preferred, could lose their entire investment in our capital stock, including all amounts invested in the Series A Preferred.\nThe requirement that each prospective purchaser of Series A Preferred open and maintain an online brokerage account with Keystone may initially limit the number of potential trading market purchasers of Series A Preferred to the purchasers of Series A Preferred in the rights offering.\nIn order to trade in the Series A Preferred, a prospective purchaser is required to open an online brokerage account with Keystone Capital Corporation (\u201cKeystone\u201d) and holders of Series A Preferred will be unable to access their shares of Series A Preferred except through that account. We anticipate that it will take time for persons who were not investors in the rights offering to make the decision to open the required account with Keystone in anticipation of trading in the Series A\nPreferred, and it is possible that very few will ever do so. Consequently, we expect liquidity in the Series A Preferred to be very limited, which could have a material adverse effect on holders\u2019 ability to trade the Series A Preferred.\nPrior to the rights offering there was no trading market for the Series A Preferred or the Series B Preferred, and active trading markets may not develop.\nThe Series A Preferred is a new issue of securities that may be traded only on an unprecedented trading platform. Prior to the rights offering there was no established trading market for the Series A Preferred, and no digital security had ever been publicly traded on the PRO Securities ATS or utilizing the t\u00d8 Platform. As of February 1, 2017 only 140 persons had opened online brokerage account with Keystone for the purpose of acquiring and holding shares of Series A Preferred, including persons who opened accounts in order to participate in the rights offering, and a very small number of trades in the Series A Preferred had taken place since the closing of the rights offering in December 2016. The Series A Preferred is not and will not be listed on any securities exchange or any other market of any kind, other than the PRO Securities ATS utilizing the t\u00d8 Platform. Even if a trading market for the Series A Preferred does develop on the PRO Securities ATS utilizing the t\u00d8 Platform, the depth and liquidity of that market and the ability of the holders to sell the Series A Preferred may nevertheless be very limited, which may have a material adverse effect on holders of the Series A Preferred.\nThe Series B Preferred is a new issue of securities, and prior to the rights offering there was no trading market for the Series B Preferred. The Series B Preferred is not and will not be listed on any securities exchange. The Series B Preferred is traded in the over-the-counter market and we expect it to be quoted on the OTCQB market operated by OTC Markets Group. We have encountered an unexpected delay in the quotation of the Series B Preferred on the OTCQB. OTC Markets is unable to publicly provide quotation or trade data until FINRA clears a Form 211 filed by a broker dealer. We understand that one or more broker dealers have made Form 211 filings with FINRA, but to date FINRA has not cleared any of them. In any case, we continue to expect that the depth and liquidity of trading and the ability of the holders to sell Series B Preferred may be very limited, which may have a material adverse effect on holders of Series B Preferred.\nWe do not intend to issue any additional shares of either Series A Preferred or Series B Preferred, which is expected to result in very limited trading in each series.\nAlthough we have the right to convert the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred into Series B Preferred, we do not intend to issue any additional shares of Series A Preferred or any additional shares of Series B Preferred. Consequently, we expect trading of the Series A Preferred and the Series B Preferred to be limited to the shares we issued in the rights offering. As a result, trading in the Series A Preferred and the Series B Preferred may be very limited.\nWe do not expect there to be any market makers to develop a trading market in the Series A Preferred.\nMost securities that are publicly traded in the United States have one or more broker-dealers acting as \u201cmarket makers\u201d for the security. A market maker is a firm that stands ready to buy and sell the security on a regular and continuous basis at publicly quoted prices. We do not believe that the Series A Preferred will have any market makers, which could contribute to a lack of liquidity in the Series A Preferred, and could have a material adverse effect on holders\u2019 ability to trade the Series A Preferred.\nAccounts for the Series A Preferred will be held directly in the customer\u2019s name, rather than in \u201cstreet name.\u201d\nEach investor in the Series A Preferred is required to open an online brokerage account in his, her or its name with Keystone. Investors are not permitted to hold their Series A Preferred in \u201cstreet name.\u201d The Series A Preferred shares are not held at a central securities depository. Instead, the shares are directly recorded on our stockholder books and records maintained by Computershare Trust Company, N.A. (\u201cComputershare\u201d). As a very substantial portion of U.S. publicly traded securities currently are held in \u201cstreet name,\u201d we expect that many potential investors in the Series A Preferred may not be interested in holding securities in their own names and therefore will not invest in the Series A Preferred. In addition, as a result of this requirement, individual retirement accounts and other fiduciary or nominee accounts including 401(k) accounts are unable to acquire shares of Series A Preferred (although custodial accounts for minors are permitted if the custodian would qualify to purchase shares of Series A Preferred on its own behalf, subject to certain restrictions). We expect that these limitations will further limit liquidity in the Series A Preferred, and the limitations may have a material adverse effect on the development of any trading market in the Series A Preferred.\nThe complete trading history of each digital wallet will be available to the general public and it may be possible for members of the public to determine the identity of the holders of wallets.\nThe t\u00d8 Platform makes trade data publicly available shortly after each trade. Although the trade data that the t\u00d8 Platform makes publicly available is anonymous, the publicly available information includes the digital wallet address (the location where records of transactions and balances involving the series A Preferred are stored) of each holder transacting in Series A Preferred, and the entire trading history of each digital wallet (including the number of securities traded by each digital wallet, the price of each trade and the balance of the securities held in each digital wallet). As a result, the trading history of each digital wallet is available to the general public. It may be possible for members of the public to determine the identity of the holders of certain wallets based on the information that the t\u00d8 Platform makes publicly available and other publicly available information, including any ownership reports required to be filed with the SEC regarding the Series A Preferred.\nIn addition, Delaware law provides that any stockholder of the Company has the right upon written demand under oath stating the purpose of the demand to inspect and copy the Company\u2019s stock ledger and a list of its stockholders for any proper purpose. Delaware law also requires the Company to make lists of its stockholders, including the number of shares held, available for inspection by stockholders of the Company in connection with stockholder meetings. These lists disclose the identity of stockholders of record, but not stockholders who hold their shares in \u201cstreet name.\u201d Because all holders of the Series A Preferred will be holders of record, all of them will be subject to the risk of loss of their anonymity.\nPotential investors who desire to execute their trades in relative anonymity may find these aspects of the t\u00d8 Platform unattractive, which may further limit liquidity in the Series A Preferred, and may have a material adverse effect on the development of any trading market in the Series A Preferred.\nOnly certain persons and entities are able to acquire Series A Preferred.\nOnly certain persons and entities may purchase Series A Preferred. We expect that these limitations will limit liquidity in the Series A Preferred, and the limitations may have a material adverse effect on the development of any trading market in the Series A Preferred.\nThe Series A Preferred and the development of a trading market for the Series A Preferred will depend on both Keystone and its clearing broker, ETC.\nThe Series A Preferred will depend on the continuing business operations of both Keystone and Electronic Transaction Clearing, Inc. (\u201cETC\u201d). Keystone is the only broker-dealer authorized to provide the accounts required to acquire, hold and trade shares of Series A Preferred, and ETC is the clearing broker for Keystone with respect to the Series A Preferred. Any failure of either Keystone or ETC to continue operating its business in the ordinary course or to satisfactorily perform their respective obligations could require PRO Securities to engage a substitute broker-dealer to perform the functions we expect Keystone to perform, and Keystone or such substitute broker-dealer might need to engage a substitute clearing broker. PRO Securities or Keystone may not be able to do so on a timely basis or at all. A transition from Keystone to a replacement broker-dealer or from ETC to a replacement clearing broker would be a lengthy process, during which time it would be impossible to trade Series A Preferred.\nA violation of privacy or data protection laws could have a material adverse effect on PRO Securities, t\u00d8.com or other entities, the t\u00d8 Platform and the Series A Preferred.\nPRO Securities, t\u00d8.com and other entities relevant to the operation of the PRO Securities ATS utilizing the t\u00d8 Platform, including Keystone, ETC and Computershare, are subject to applicable privacy and data protection laws and regulations. Any violations of laws and regulations relating to the safeguarding of private information could subject us or any of them to fines, penalties or other regulatory actions, as well as to civil actions by affected parties. Any such violations could adversely affect the ability of PRO Securities to operate the PRO Securities ATS or to use the t\u00d8 Platform, either of which could have a material adverse effect on holders\u2019 ability to trade Series A Preferred.\nPRO Securities, t\u00d8.com, the PRO Securities ATS, the t\u00d8 Platform and the other entities relevant to the operation of the PRO Securities ATS are subject to cyberattacks, security risks and risks of security breaches.\nPRO Securities, t\u00d8.com, the PRO Securities ATS, the t\u00d8 Platform and the other entities relevant to the operation of the PRO Securities ATS utilizing the t\u00d8 Platform, including Keystone, ETC and Computershare, are all subject to cyberattacks, security risks and risks of security breaches. An attack on any of them or a breach of security of any of them could result in a loss of private data, unauthorized trades, and an interruption of trading for an extended period of time. Any such attack or breach could adversely affect the ability of PRO Securities to operate the PRO Securities ATS or to utilize the t\u00d8 Platform, or both, any of which could have a material adverse effect on holders\u2019 ability to trade the Series A Preferred. Any breach of data security that exposes or compromises the security of any of the private digital keys used to authorize or validate transaction\norders, or that enables any unauthorized person to generate any of the private digital keys, could result in unauthorized trades and would have a material adverse effect on the Series A Preferred. Because trades on the PRO Securities ATS utilizing the t\u00d8 Platform settle on the trade date, it could be impossible to correct unauthorized trades.\nIn the event of the insolvency of Keystone or ETC, the Securities Investor Protection Corporation would be unable to cause the return of shares of Series A Preferred until a substitute for Keystone or ETC, as applicable, was in place.\nThe Securities Investor Protection Corporation (\u201cSIPC\u201d) oversees the liquidation of member broker-dealers that close when the broker-dealer is bankrupt or in financial trouble, and customer assets are missing. In a liquidation under the Securities Investor Protection Act, SIPC and a court-appointed trustee typically work to return customers\u2019 securities and cash. Within limits, SIPC expedites the return of missing customer property by protecting each customer up to $500,000 for securities and cash (including a $250,000 limit for cash only). If Keystone or ETC were to become insolvent, the structure of the trading system for the Series A Preferred could cause delays in the return of Series A Preferred until a substitute for Keystone or ETC, as applicable, was in place, which could have a material adverse effect on holders of Series A Preferred.\nCertain transactions involving the Series A Preferred will require manual intervention, which could result in errors.\nAll ordinary course Series A Preferred purchase and sale transactions initiated by purchasers and sellers through their Keystone accounts are executed on the PRO Securities ATS utilizing the automated processes of the t\u00d8 Platform, without separate manual intervention by any of the relevant parties. Extraordinary transactions, however, may require manual intervention, which would be initiated by employees of ETC through the t\u00d8 Platform. For example, a unilateral transfer to a specific transferee, such as gift to a family member or charity, or an involuntary transfer pursuant to a court order, will require such manual intervention. In any situation involving manual intervention, there is a risk of human error. The same-day settlement of trades on the PRO Securities ATS utilizing the t\u00d8 Platform also means that any error not detected promptly on the trade date may be impossible to correct. See \u201cThe same-day settlement of trades on the PRO Securities ATS utilizing the t\u00d8 Platform may make it impossible to correct trading errors in the Series A Preferred\u201d below.\nThe same-day settlement of trades on the PRO Securities ATS utilizing the t\u00d8 Platform may make it impossible to correct trading errors in the Series A Preferred.\nTrades on the PRO Securities ATS utilizing the t\u00d8 Platform settle on the trade date rather than on a three-day (or T+3) basis. This may make it impossible to correct trading errors that might have been corrected prior to settlement under a T+3 system. Consequently, persons acquiring shares of Series A Preferred must accept the risk that correction of any trading errors may be impossible. The occurrence of any such trading error could have a material adverse effect on any affected holder of Series A Preferred. Further, in the future ETC\u2019s custody and settlement systems may be able to move funds between customer accounts in near real-time after order executions are recorded by the PRO Securities ATS on the electronic data store in which the ownership and transfer of the Series A Preferred are recorded (the \u201cProprietary Ledger\u201d), which would result in near-real time settlement, which would further increase the risk that correction of trading errors may be impossible.\nThe technology on which the t\u00d8 Platform depends is in an area in which t\u00d8.com and PRO Securities have limited experience.\nNeither t\u00d8.com nor PRO Securities has significant experience with the technology on which the t\u00d8 Platform depends or the operation of the t\u00d8 Platform. The creation and operation of a digital system for the public trading of securities utilizing a distributed ledger to enable members of the public to confirm that the public copies of the Proprietary Ledger have not been altered are subject to technical, legal and regulatory constraints. Portions of the technology utilized by the t\u00d8 Platform have been developed by t\u00d8.com very recently. Any problems t\u00d8.com or PRO Securities encounters with the operation of the t\u00d8 Platform, including technical, legal and regulatory problems, could have a material adverse effect on the Series A Preferred.\nThe t\u00d8 Platform has been developed by key technology employees of t\u00d8.com and its affiliates, and its operation and further development depend on the continued availability of those key employees.\nThe t\u00d8 Platform, including the technology and intellectual property involved in its creation and operation, has been developed primarily by a small number of key technology employees of t\u00d8.com and its affiliates. The loss of the services of any of those key employees could have a material adverse effect on the ability of t\u00d8.com to maintain the t\u00d8 Platform, which could have a material adverse effect on PRO Securities\u2019 ability to use the t\u00d8 Platform. If t\u00d8.com were to lose the services of any such key employees, it could be difficult or impossible to replace them, and the loss of any of them could have a material adverse effect on the Series A Preferred.\nt\u00d8.com may continue to modify the t\u00d8 Platform, and any such modifications could require periods of downtime during which trading on the PRO Securities ATS might be suspended.\nt\u00d8.com developed the t\u00d8 Platform recently and intends to continue to work on enhancements to the t\u00d8 Platform. The continued development of enhancements to the t\u00d8 Platform or other modifications of the t\u00d8 Platform could cause service interruptions and interruptions in trading on the PRO Securities ATS, which could make it impossible to trade the Series A Preferred from time to time. Any such interruptions could occur with little or no notice.\nOur use of the Bitcoin blockchain to enable members of the public to confirm that the public copies of the Proprietary Ledger have not been altered depends on the continued availability and functioning of the Bitcoin blockchain.\nThe Series A Preferred trade exclusively on the PRO Securities ATS utilizing the t\u00d8 Platform. The t\u00d8 Platform embeds a digital fingerprint in the Bitcoin blockchain that may be used to confirm that the public copies of the Proprietary Ledger have not been altered. No person, business, governmental authority or other entity or authority of any kind has any obligation to provide any financial, technical or other support to the continued operation or development of blockchain technology. If the Bitcoin blockchain were to become unavailable to us in its current form and functionality for any reason, we would need to use a different publicly distributed ledger, which could make it more difficult for members of the public to confirm that the public copies of the Proprietary Ledger have not been altered, which could have a material adverse effect on the Series A Preferred.\nInvestors may not have the skills necessary to confirm that the public copies of the Proprietary Ledger have not been altered.\nIn order to confirm that the public copies of the Proprietary Ledger have not been altered, a person must have the technical skills required to do so. If an investor does not have those technical skills, the investor will be unable to personally confirm that the public copies of the Proprietary Ledger have not been altered.\nTrading in the Series A Preferred depends on the operation and functionality of the PRO Securities ATS, on t\u00d8.com\u2019s proprietary t\u00d8 Platform and on the Proprietary Ledger.\nThe Series A Preferred trades exclusively on the PRO Securities ATS utilizing the t\u00d8 Platform. The ATS is operated and maintained by PRO Securities, and the t\u00d8 Platform is maintained by t\u00d8.com. Each of PRO Securities and t\u00d8.com is a direct or indirect majority-owned subsidiary of the Company, and neither of them has substantial resources. If the PRO Securities ATS or the t\u00d8 Platform were to fail to operate as intended for any reason, trading in the Series A Preferred could be impossible until the failure were corrected and full functionality of the affected system or systems were restored and tested. Further, if the Proprietary Ledger were to fail to operate as intended, or were to become unavailable to us in its current form and functionality for any reason, the t\u00d8 Platform might be unable to publish trade data or to provide trade data to ETC and to the transfer agent. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our ability to execute or settle trades of Series A Preferred, to maintain accurate records of the ownership of the Series A Preferred and to comply with our obligations relating to records of the ownership of the Series A Preferred and a material adverse effect on the holders of the Series A Preferred.\nThe Series A Preferred depends on Computershare as the transfer agent for the Series A Preferred.\nComputershare serves as the transfer agent for both the Series A Preferred and the Series B Preferred. If Computershare were unable or unwilling for any reason to serve as the transfer agent for the Series A Preferred, trading in the Series A Preferred would be impossible unless we were able to locate another transfer agent able and willing to serve as a replacement transfer agent for the Series A Preferred. We estimate that a transition from Computershare to a replacement transfer agent would take approximately three months; however, any such transition could take longer, during which time it would be impossible to trade in the Series A Preferred.\nThe t\u00d8 Platform relies on technology and intellectual property rights licensed from t\u00d8.com to PRO Securities.\nThe ability of PRO Securities to operate the PRO Securities ATS utilizing the t\u00d8 Platform depends on technology and intellectual property rights that PRO Securities licenses from our majority-owned subsidiary t\u00d8.com. Keystone, ETC and Computershare, in the performance of their respective obligations, also depend on the technology and intellectual property rights that they license (or have licensed on their behalf) from t\u00d8.com. If for any reason t\u00d8.com were to fail to comply with its obligations under the applicable license agreement, or were unable to provide or were to fail to provide the technology and intellectual property that PRO Securities requires, PRO Securities would be unable to operate the PRO Securities ATS utilizing the t\u00d8 Platform, which would have a material adverse effect on the Series A Preferred.\nIf the rights of t\u00d8.com to the technology or intellectual property it licenses to PRO Securities were invalidated or limited, PRO Securities might not be able to operate the PRO Securities ATS utilizing the t\u00d8 Platform.\nt\u00d8.com has filed both provisional and non-provisional patent applications covering numerous aspects of the technology relating to the t\u00d8 Platform, none of which have been granted. If third parties obtain patents covering any or all of the technology relating to the t\u00d8 Platform, or if the rights of t\u00d8.com to the technology or intellectual property necessary for the operation of the t\u00d8 Platform were otherwise invalidated or limited, PRO Securities could become unable to operate the PRO Securities ATS utilizing the t\u00d8 Platform, which would have a material adverse effect on the Series A Preferred and could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nThe t\u00d8 Platform may face substantial competition from a number of known and unknown competitors as well as the risk that one or more of them may obtain patents covering technology critical to the operation of the t\u00d8 Platform.\nWe believe that a number of organizations are or may be working to develop trading systems utilizing distributed ledger or blockchain technologies that may be competitive with the t\u00d8 Platform. Some or all of such organizations and/or their respective investors have substantially greater resources than t\u00d8.com or we have, and many of them appear to be attempting to patent technologies that may be competitive with or similar to the technology t\u00d8.com has developed. We do not have access to detailed information about the technologies these organizations and/or their respective investors may be attempting to patent. If one or more other persons, companies or organizations obtains a valid patent covering technology critical to the t\u00d8 Platform, t\u00d8.com and we and the other entities that need the relevant technology in order to enable the t\u00d8 Platform to operate as intended might be unable or unwilling to license the technology, and it could become impossible for the t\u00d8 Platform to operate, which would have a material adverse effect on the Series A Preferred and could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nSome market participants may oppose the development of distributed ledger or blockchain-based systems like the t\u00d8 Platform.\nMany participants in the system currently used for trading public securities in the United States may oppose the development of alternative systems such as the t\u00d8 Platform. The market participants who may oppose such a system may include market participants with significantly greater resources, including financial resources and political influence, than we have. The ability of PRO Securities to operate the t\u00d8 Platform could be adversely affected by any actions of any such market participants that result in additional regulatory requirements or other activities that make it more difficult for PRO Securities to operate the t\u00d8 Platform, which could have a material adverse effect on the Series A Preferred.\nCurrent regulations could require the PRO Securities ATS to be registered as an exchange under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and may effectively limit trading on the PRO Securities ATS utilizing the t\u00d8 Platform.\nUnder current law, an organization, including an alternative trading system, generally is exempt from the definition of an \u201cexchange\u201d under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), if it is in compliance with Regulation ATS. However, an organization, including a registered ATS, can lose the exemption if it fails to maintain compliance with Regulation ATS or if (1) during three of the preceding four calendar quarters such an organization had (A) 50% or more of the average daily dollar trading volume in any security and 5% or more of the average daily dollar trading volume in any class of securities or (B) 40% or more of the average daily dollar trading volume in any class of securities; and (2) the SEC determines, after notice to the organization and an opportunity for the organization to respond, that such an exemption would not be necessary or appropriate in the public interest or consistent with the protection of investors taking into account the requirements for exchange registration under section 6 of the Exchange Act and the objectives of the national market system under the Exchange Act. Consequently, even if PRO Securities and the PRO Securities ATS are in compliance with Regulation ATS, the SEC could determine that the PRO Securities ATS should not be exempt from the requirements to register as an exchange. Any such determination, and the process leading up to any such determination, would result in substantial costs and would have an adverse effect on PRO Securities, the PRO Securities ATS and the Company. PRO Securities may not have the resources, ability or willingness to register the PRO Securities ATS as an exchange. This potential limitation may effectively limit trading on the PRO Securities ATS and the t\u00d8 Platform, which could have a material adverse effect on the Series A Preferred.\nThe potential application of U.S. laws regarding investment securities to the Series A Preferred is unclear.\nThe commercial law regarding investment securities in the United States is well-developed. Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code as adopted in most states, including Delaware, provides a set of rules that governs common aspects of securities transfers and related matters. Because of the differences between the Series A Preferred and traditional investment securities, there is a risk that issues that might easily be resolved by existing law if traditional securities were involved may not\nbe easily resolved for the Series A Preferred. The occurrence of any such issue or dispute could have a material adverse effect on the holders of Series A Preferred.\nThe potential application of U.S. laws regarding virtual currencies and money transmission to PRO Securities\u2019 use of the Bitcoin blockchain is unclear.\nExisting state and federal laws applicable to various activities of persons exchanging or otherwise using virtual currencies, in some cases expressly including Bitcoin, impose prohibitions and require licensing or registration requirements and impose substantive regulations on such persons. Many more states impose licensing and substantive regulation on persons engaging in various activities relating to money transmission, some of which do or may apply to the transmission of virtual currencies such as Bitcoin. The failure to be properly licensed and registered if required under any of these state or federal laws can be a criminal offense. The t\u00d8 Platform will use the Bitcoin blockchain for the purpose of enabling members of the public to confirm that the public copies of the Proprietary Ledger have not been altered. The t\u00d8 Platform will not use the Bitcoin blockchain for any purpose of transmitting value; the t\u00d8 Platform will simply transmit nominal amounts of Bitcoin to itself in order to embed data relating to Series A Preferred transactions into the Bitcoin blockchain. We estimate that the value of the Bitcoin to be transmitted will total approximately $5.00 or less per trading day. The t\u00d8 Platform is not licensed under the virtual currency or money transmission regulations of any state in the United States, and is not registered with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (\u201cFinCEN\u201d) of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Although we do not believe that the t\u00d8 Platform\u2019s proposed use of the Bitcoin blockchain requires licensing or registration by any state or registration with FinCEN, if any regulatory authority were to assert otherwise, it could have a material adverse effect on the ability of the t\u00d8 Platform to publish Series A Preferred trade data to the Bitcoin blockchain.\nThe potential application of foreign laws to the t\u00d8 Platform is unclear.\nAny person opening an account with Keystone will be required to represent that doing so and acquiring shares of Series A Preferred will not cause a violation of any law, rule or regulation of any jurisdiction outside of the United States and will not subject us or PRO Securities or the t\u00d8 Platform to regulation by any authority in any jurisdiction outside of the United States. We are also limiting purchasers of Series A Preferred to certain U.S. residents, entities and trusts. If we became subject to any law, rule or regulation of any jurisdiction outside of the United States, it could have a material adverse effect on the ability of PRO Securities to operate the t\u00d8 Platform and on the Series A Preferred.\nRegulatory or factual developments may adversely affect the t\u00d8 Platform, its future development, or both.\nNeither PRO Securities nor t\u00d8.com is registered as a transfer agent under the Exchange Act. If PRO Securities or t\u00d8.com were required to register as a transfer agent, the process would be expensive and one or both entities might be unable to do so. Further, future regulatory developments could otherwise affect the t\u00d8 Platform or the ability of PRO Securities to operate the t\u00d8 Platform. To the extent that any current or future regulatory requirements adversely affect the ability of PRO Securities to operate the t\u00d8 Platform or its ability to utilize the Bitcoin blockchain, such regulatory requirements would have a material adverse effect on the Series A Preferred.\nPRO Securities and SpeedRoute are registered broker-dealers and are subject to extensive regulation.\nBroker-dealers are subject to extensive regulatory requirements under federal and state laws and regulations and self-regulatory organization (\u201cSRO\u201d) rules. PRO Securities and SpeedRoute are registered with the SEC as broker-dealers under the Exchange Act and in the states in which they conduct securities business and are members of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d) and other SROs. PRO Securities and SpeedRoute are subject to regulation, examination and disciplinary action by the SEC, FINRA and state securities regulators, as well as other governmental authorities and SROs with which it is registered or licensed or of which it is a member. Any failure of PRO Securities or SpeedRoute to comply with all applicable rules and regulations could have a material adverse effect on the Series A Preferred.\nPRO Securities is involved in an ongoing dialog with regulatory authorities.\nPRO Securities has been and remains involved in ongoing discussions with regulatory authorities about the operation of the PRO Securities ATS utilizing the t\u00d8 Platform and various matters relating to the regulated entities involved. While many of the discussions have been relatively informal, PRO Securities has also received and responded to written inquiries, and most recently received and responded to additional written inquiries from FINRA. While we consider these continuing inquiries to be ordinary course in light of the non-traditional nature of the registered alternative trading system operated by PRO Securities utilizing the t\u00d8 Platform, any failure of PRO Securities to satisfy FINRA or any other regulatory authority that PRO Securities is in compliance with all applicable rules and regulations could have a material adverse effect on the Series A Preferred.\nPRO Securities and Computershare may experience operational or other difficulties with the role Computershare is expected to perform, and our strategic interests and objectives and those of Computershare may not be completely aligned and may diverge over time.\nThe Company has engaged Computershare to serve as transfer agent for the Series A Preferred. Computershare uses the t\u00d8 software to receive new and updated shareholder personal identifying information from Keystone and transaction information recorded on the Proprietary Ledger in order to update and maintain the share register. To our knowledge, our relationship with Computershare is the first of its kind, and there are risks of difficulties with both the operational aspects of the relationship and the strategic aspects of the relationship. Even if the operational aspects of the relationship work as anticipated, our strategic interests and objectives and those of Computershare are different, and they may diverge further over time. Any difficulties we encounter with either the operational aspects of our relationship with Computershare or with the alignment of our respective strategic interests and objectives, or any other difficulties we may encounter in our business relationship with Computershare, could have a material adverse effect on the ability of PRO Securities to operate the PRO Securities ATS utilizing the t\u00d8 Platform and have a material adverse effect on holders\u2019 ability to trade the Series A Preferred.\nThe requirement that each prospective purchaser of our Series A Preferred open and maintain an online brokerage account with Keystone may subject customers to the risk of fee and commission increases by Keystone.\nAt present the t\u00d8 Platform does not allow more than a single broker-dealer to provide access to the system. The lack of an alternative broker-dealer to provide access to the t\u00d8 Platform may subject customers to the risk of fee and commission increases by Keystone. Keystone has agreed to limits on the fees and commissions it will charge to customers who trade shares of the Series A Preferred; however, if PRO Securities and t\u00d8.com agree to amend the relevant agreements to permit increases to those limits, or if such agreements or the provisions regarding such matters were ineffective for any reason, it could have a material adverse effect on holders of the Series A Preferred.\nDue to the unavailability of Rule 144 for resales of Series A Preferred and anticipated low volume restrictions for sales by affiliates of the Company of Series B Preferred under Rule 144, Company affiliates may elect not to acquire Series A Preferred or Series B Preferred.\nRule 144 is not available for resales of Series A Preferred. In addition, because the number of shares of Series B Preferred outstanding may be very small, Rule 144 may permit public resales of Series B Preferred by our affiliates only in very small amounts. As a result, affiliates of the Company may have difficulty reselling Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred unless we register their sales. To make it easier for affiliates of the Company to publicly resell Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred, we intend to register their resales. We have entered into a registration rights agreement pursuant to which we have agreed to file a registration statement for resales of Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred by our affiliates; however, such registration statement may not become or remain effective. Further, a seller under a registration statement may have liabilities that a seller under Rule 144 does not have. Very few of our affiliates subscribed for shares of Preferred Stock in the rights offering, and any or all of these matters may cause affiliates of the Company to elect not to acquire shares of Series A Preferred or Series B Preferred after the rights offering, which could limit liquidity in the Series A Preferred or Series B Preferred or depress the trading prices of the Series A Preferred or Series B Preferred.\nAffiliates of the Company may incur substantially greater risks in selling shares of Series A Preferred or Series B Preferred under a registration statement than they would if they were able to sell under Rule 144.\nBecause Rule 144 is not available for public resales of Series A Preferred, and because Rule 144 likely will permit resales of Series B Preferred by affiliates only in very small amounts, affiliates may be unable to sell Series A Preferred or Series B Preferred except pursuant to a registration statement that we expect to file for their resales. However, a seller under a registration statement may have liabilities that a seller under Rule 144 does not have. Consequently, affiliates of the Company who acquire shares of Series A Preferred or Series B Preferred and subsequently sell them under any such registration statement could incur material liabilities that they would not have risked incurring in sales under Rule 144.\nRule 144 also will not be available for resales of \u201crestricted shares\u201d of Series A Preferred.\nPersons, including non-affiliates of a public company such as the Company, who acquire shares directly or indirectly from the public company, or from an affiliate of the public company, in a transaction or chain of transactions not involving any public offering, acquire \u201crestricted shares\u201d for purposes of Rule 144. Although Rule 144 permits public sales of \u201crestricted shares\u201d subject to certain conditions, we do not expect Rule 144 ever to be available for any sales of Series A Preferred. Because all of the shares of Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred were issued in a registered public offering, and because we expect to register the resale of shares of Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred by our affiliates, we do not anticipate that\nany outstanding shares of Series A Preferred or Series B Preferred will be \u201crestricted\u201d for purposes of Rule 144. However, any person who acquires any shares of Series A Preferred or Series B Preferred directly or indirectly from us, or directly or indirectly from any person who is then an affiliate of ours, in either case in a transaction or chain of transactions not involving any public offering (which term generally means registered offerings and sales under Rule 144), or who acquires shares of Series A Preferred or Series B Preferred in any other manner described in the definition of \u201crestricted securities\u201d in Rule 144, will acquire \u201crestricted\u201d shares. We do not expect Rule 144 ever to be available for public resales of any such shares of Series A Preferred, and the sale of any such shares may be difficult or impossible.\nWe will have an economic incentive to repurchase Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred at prices below the redemption price, and our doing so could cause the trading prices of Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred, as applicable, to decrease further.\nWe do not currently intend to repurchase any of the Series A Preferred or Series B Preferred. However, we could do so, subject to applicable laws and regulations regarding issuer repurchases of their capital stock. If we repurchase any shares, we would do so only at prices lower than the prices at which we might be entitled to redeem the shares. Because our right to redeem the Series A Preferred and the Series B Preferred will be at prices that will vary with the price of our common stock as well as the prices of the Series A Preferred and the Series B Preferred, respectively, and in any case would be no less than the Subscription Price, we will have an economic incentive to repurchase the shares at their trading prices from time to time if those prices are lower than the prices at which we would be entitled to redeem the shares. If we repurchase (or redeem) shares of either Series A Preferred or Series B Preferred, the trading market for the shares would become less liquid, which could cause the trading prices to decrease further, giving us an economic incentive to repurchase additional shares. The occurrence of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on holders of Series A Preferred, the holders of Series B Preferred, or holders of both series, and on the liquidity in and trading prices of the Series A Preferred, the Series B Preferred or both.\nWe do not expect to register either the Series A Preferred or the Series B Preferred as a class of securities under the Exchange Act. Consequently investors may be unaware of holders of significant percentages of the Series A Preferred, the Series B Preferred, or both.\nWe do not expect to register either the Series A Preferred or the Series B Preferred under the Exchange Act. Consequently, the provisions of the Exchange Act requiring beneficial holders of more than 5% of a registered class of securities to report such beneficial holdings are unlikely to apply, and investors may be unaware of holders who may hold significant percentages of either the Series A Preferred or the Series B Preferred or both. Although the t\u00d8 Platform makes the holdings and trading histories of all digital wallets public, the information so provided is not a substitute for the types of information required by these securities laws.\nIn certain circumstances, we may be required to register the Series A Preferred or the Series B Preferred under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act, which would subject significant stockholders to the reporting requirements of Regulation 13D-G.\nAlthough we do not expect to register either the Series A Preferred or the Series B Preferred under the Exchange Act, we could be required to register one or both series in the future, including as a result of factors outside of our control, such as the number of record holders of the Series A Preferred or the Series B Preferred. Registration would mean, among other things, that a holder of shares of the applicable series could be required to file beneficial ownership reports with the SEC, generally to the extent such holder beneficially owns more than 5% of the shares of such series. Such holders therefore would become subject to additional obligations and liabilities under the Exchange Act, which could include monetary penalties for failure to file the required reports.\nDecreases in the trading prices of our common stock could adversely affect the Series A Preferred, the Series B Preferred or both.\nDecreases in the trading price of our common stock, which could occur as the result of developments in our business or from future sales of common stock by us or by holders of the common stock or for other reasons, may cause decreases in the trading prices of the Series A Preferred, the Series B Preferred, or both. For example, in the future, we may sell shares of our common stock to raise capital or to acquire interests in other companies. Any of these events may dilute an investor\u2019s ownership interest in the Company and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and, in turn, the trading prices of the Series A Preferred, the Series B Preferred, or both.\nIn addition, we have reserved shares of our common stock for issuance upon the exercise of stock options and upon vesting of restricted stock units granted under our equity incentive plan. We also intend to grant additional restricted stock units, and may grant other types of equity awards, under our equity incentive plans in the future. Any of these events, and any other\nevent that results in sales of a substantial amount of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that any such sales may occur, could reduce the trading price of our common stock and, in turn, the trading prices of the Series A Preferred, the Series B Preferred, or both. This could also impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of our securities. Decreases in the trading price of the Series A Preferred or Series B Preferred could also adversely affect the price of the other series. Any of the foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on holders of the Series A Preferred and holders of the Series B Preferred and on the trading prices of the Series A Preferred, the Series B Preferred, or both.\nAlthough the Series A Preferred and the Series B Preferred have characteristics similar to those of our common stock, the differences may adversely affect the trading prices of the Series A Preferred and of the Series B Preferred.\nEach share of Series A Preferred and each share of Series B Preferred is intended to have voting and dividend rights and rights upon liquidation substantially similar to those of one share of our common stock, except that the Series A Preferred and the Series B Preferred will have a dividend preference over the common stock, the ownership of the Series A Preferred will be tracked on a publicly distributed ledger and we will have the right to redeem shares of Series A Preferred and/or Series B Preferred and to convert the Series A Preferred into Series B Preferred. The Series A Preferred will also be subject to other restrictions, particularly restrictions on ownership. These provisions may have a material adverse effect on the trading price of the Series A Preferred.\nWe will have the right to convert the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred into shares of Series B Preferred at any time, and the Series B Preferred might be trading for substantially less than the Series A Preferred at the time.\nWe will have the right to cause the conversion of all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred into shares of Series B Preferred at any time. If we were to do so at a time when the Series B Preferred were trading at a price lower than the trading price of the Series A Preferred, holders of Series A Preferred would likely experience an immediate and potentially material decrease in the market value of the Series A Preferred they hold and of the Series B Preferred they would receive upon the conversion. Investors should not purchase shares of Series A Preferred unless they are willing to hold shares of Series B Preferred in lieu of shares of Series A Preferred.\nThe terms of the Series B Preferred could be amended after the issuance of the Series B Preferred without the consent of the holders of the Series A Preferred.\nThe terms of the Series B Preferred may be amended without the consent of the holders of the Series A Preferred. Nevertheless, we will have the right to cause the conversion of all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred into shares of Series B Preferred at any time. Consequently, holders of Series A Preferred will be subject to the risk that their shares could be converted into shares of Series B Preferred having terms different from those of the Series B Preferred at the date of issuance or at the date of a holder's acquisition. Investors should not purchase shares of Series A Preferred unless they are willing to hold shares of the Series B Preferred in lieu of the Series A Preferred and are willing to accept the risk that the terms of the Series B Preferred could be amended prior to conversion without the consent of the holders of the Series A Preferred.\nEven if the Series A Preferred and the Series B Preferred were to have characteristics identical to those of our common stock, a share of Series A Preferred and/or Series B Preferred might nevertheless have a substantially lower market value than a share of our common stock.\nThe trading prices of the Series A Preferred and the Series B Preferred may be substantially lower than the trading price of our common stock at any time. The market for the Series B Preferred is expected to have substantially less liquidity than the market for our common stock, which is traded on the Nasdaq Global Market, and the market for the Series A Preferred may be even more limited. The Series B Preferred trades in the over-the-counter market rather than on any securities exchange, and the Series A Preferred trades exclusively on the PRO Securities ATS utilizing the t\u00d8 Platform, which is a closed trading platform that had not experienced public trading in any security prior to the issuance of the Series A Preferred. Consequently, the trading prices of the Series A Preferred and the Series B Preferred may both be substantially lower than the trading price of our common stock, which could have a material adverse effect on holders of Series A Preferred and holders of Series B Preferred.\nHolders of Preferred Stock have no rights with respect to our common stock, but they may be adversely affected by certain events or changes made with respect to our common stock.\nHolders of Preferred Stock have no rights with respect to our common stock, and no right to convert their Series A Preferred or Series B Preferred into shares of common stock or to exchange their Series A Preferred or Series B Preferred for shares of common stock, except that such holders have the right to vote with the common stock (together with the holders of the\nother series of Preferred Stock) on any matter submitted to a vote of the holders of the common stock, the right to receive payments upon liquidation pari passu with the holders of the common stock (together with the holders of the other series of Preferred Stock) and the right to receive dividends (together with the holders of the other series of Preferred Stock) in preference to the holders of the common stock and to participate in cash dividends, if any, paid on the common stock. Holders of Preferred Stock do not have other rights of the holders of the common stock, including the right to respond to common stock tender offers, if any, and their investment in the Series A Preferred and/or the Series B Preferred may be materially negatively affected by any such event. Holders\u2019 lack of any such rights, or the occurrence of any such event, could have a material adverse effect on holders of Series A Preferred and holders of Series B Preferred and on the trading prices of the Series A Preferred and the Series B Preferred.\nVoting rights of holders of Preferred Stock generally will be limited to voting together with the holders of the common stock as a single class, and the holders of the Series A Preferred and the holders of the Series B Preferred collectively will have only a small percentage of the voting power on any matter submitted to the holders of the common stock and the Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred, voting together as a single class.\nVoting rights of holders of Preferred Stock generally will be limited to voting together with the holders of the common stock as a single class. As of February 2, 2017, the 695,898 shares of Preferred Stock outstanding represented approximately 2.7% of the combined voting power of the Series A Preferred, the Series B Preferred and the common stock, voting together as a single class. If an amendment requiring stockholder approval is proposed to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or our Amended and Restated Bylaws, the holders of the Series A Preferred and the holders of the Series B Preferred will vote together with the holders of the common stock as a single class, but neither the holders of the Series A Preferred nor the holders of the Series B Preferred will be entitled to a class vote on the amendment, unless the proposed amendment would adversely affect the special rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers of the Series A Preferred or Series B Preferred, respectively. Holders\u2019 limited voting rights and any of the foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on holders of Series A Preferred and holders of Series B Preferred and on the trading prices of the Series A Preferred and the Series B Preferred.\nNeither the holders of the Series A Preferred nor the holders of the Series B Preferred have any right, either together or as separate classes, to elect any members of our board of directors.\nNeither the holders of the Series A Preferred nor the holders of the Series B Preferred have any right by themselves, either together or as separate classes, to elect any members of our board of directors. The holders of the Series A Preferred and the holders of the Series B Preferred are entitled only to vote with the holders of the common stock (and with the holders of the other class of preferred stock) as a single class in the election of directors and on any other matter coming before a vote of the holders of the common stock. Holders\u2019 lack of such rights could have a material adverse effect on holders of the Series A Preferred and the holders of the Series B Preferred and the trading prices of the Series A Preferred and the Series B Preferred.\nThe Series A Preferred and the Series B Preferred rank junior to all of our and our subsidiaries\u2019 liabilities, as well as the capital stock of our subsidiaries held by third parties, in the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or winding up of our or our subsidiaries\u2019 business.\nIn the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or winding up, our assets will be available to make payments to holders of Series A Preferred and to holders of Series B Preferred only after all of our liabilities have been paid, and neither the Series A Preferred nor the Series B Preferred will have any preference over the common stock in the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or winding up. In addition, the Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred will rank structurally junior to all existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries, as well as the capital stock of our subsidiaries held by third parties, including employees holding shares of our majority-owned subsidiary t\u00d8.com and employees holding shares of any other direct or indirect subsidiary of ours, whether now existing or created in the future, which issues shares or other equity interests to employees. We intend to adopt an employee equity incentive plan pursuant to which t\u00d8.com or a subsidiary of t\u00d8.com would issue shares or other equity interests or awards having the economic effects of equity interests to employees. The rights of holders of Preferred Stock to participate in the assets of our subsidiaries upon any liquidation or reorganization of any subsidiary will rank junior to the claims of creditors and third party equity holders of t\u00d8.com and our other subsidiaries, whether now existing or created in the future, including our employees holding shares of any of them. In the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or winding up, there may not be sufficient assets remaining, after paying our and our subsidiaries\u2019 liabilities, to pay any amounts to the holders of Series A Preferred or Series B Preferred then outstanding. As of December 31, 2016, we had liabilities of approximately $312.1 million. We may incur significant additional debt or other liabilities in the future. Any bankruptcy, liquidation or winding up of the Company or any of its wholly or partially owned subsidiaries would have a material adverse effect on holders of Series A Preferred and holders of Series B Preferred and the trading prices of the Series A Preferred and the Series B Preferred.\nOur obligation to pay dividends on the Series A Preferred or on the Series B Preferred is limited, and our ability to pay dividends on the Series A Preferred and on the Series B Preferred may be limited.\nOur obligation to pay preferential dividends on the Series A Preferred and the Series B Preferred is subject to our board of directors declaring such dividend payments. Further, although we will be contractually restricted from paying a dividend on the common stock unless we have paid preferential cumulative 1.0% annual dividends on the Series A Preferred and the Series B Preferred, we have never paid a dividend on the common stock and we have no intention of doing so. Consequently, our failure to pay preferential dividends on the Series A Preferred and on the Series B Preferred might have no legal effect on us at all, although it could adversely affect the trading prices of the Series A Preferred and of the Series B Preferred. Further, our payment of any dividends will be subject to contractual and legal restrictions and other factors the board deems relevant. Our current credit agreement contains financial covenants that could limit our ability to pay dividends. The calculations that go into the financial covenants cannot necessarily be estimated in advance, and we are unable to give any assurance that we would be able to pay dividends on the Series A Preferred, the Series B Preferred or both without violating our current credit agreement. Further, we may elect not to pay dividends on the Series A Preferred, the Series B Preferred or both rather than limiting other proposed expenditures, including expenditures that may not be contractually required, to avoid violating, or avoid the risk of violating, our current credit agreement. Moreover, agreements governing any future indebtedness of ours may further limit our ability to pay dividends on our capital stock, including the Series A Preferred and the Series B Preferred. In addition, our ability to pay dividends is limited by applicable law. Any of the foregoing facts or events could have a material adverse effect on the holders of the Series A Preferred and the holders of the Series B Preferred and on the trading prices of the Series A Preferred and the Series B Preferred.\nPurchasers of the Series A Preferred and of the Series B Preferred may be adversely affected by our issuance of any subsequent series of preferred stock.\nNeither the terms of the Series A Preferred nor the terms of the Series B Preferred restrict our ability to issue one or more additional new series of preferred stock, any or all of which may rank equally with or have preferences over the Series A Preferred and the Series B Preferred as to dividend payments, voting rights, rights upon liquidation or other types of rights. We will have no obligation to consider the specific interests of the holders of Series A Preferred or the specific interests of the holders of Series B Preferred in creating any such new series of preferred stock or engaging in any such offering or transaction. Our creation of any such new series of preferred stock or our engaging in any such offering or transaction could have a material adverse effect on the holders of Series A Preferred and the holders of Series B Preferred and the trading prices of the Series A Preferred and the Series B Preferred.\nIt is uncertain whether the IRS will treat the Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred as common stock or preferred stock for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nWe intend to treat the Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred as common stock for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether the IRS will treat the Series A Preferred and Series B Preferred as common stock for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the IRS were not to treat either the Series A Preferred or the Series B Preferred as common stock for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it could have a material adverse effect on the holders of Series A Preferred and the holders of Series B Preferred, respectively, and on the trading prices of the Series A Preferred and the Series B Preferred, respectively.\nNo guidance has been issued with respect to the effect of the PRO Securities ATS or the t\u00d8 Platform on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the Series A Preferred.\nThe PRO Securities ATS and the t\u00d8 Platform are novel and no guidance has been issued regarding the effect of the t\u00d8 Platform (or, to our knowledge, any other similar platform) on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of any shares traded utilizing it. Therefore, the effect of the t\u00d8 Platform, if any, on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the Series A Preferred is still unclear.\nThe restrictions on the tax reporting of holder\u2019s cost basis in shares of Series A Preferred will not allow normal tax planning in the sale of shares of Series A Preferred, and may result in disadvantageous tax consequences to a seller of Series A Preferred.\nTaxpayers must report gains and losses on sales of securities, and related cost basis information when they file their income tax returns. Brokers, including Keystone, also have a requirement to report sales information to the IRS on Form 1099-B. Taxpayers typically can elect one of several methods permitted by the IRS for their reporting of their cost basis in securities. However, only one method of cost basis reporting (the first-in, first-out, or FIFO, method) will be available for the Series A\nPreferred. Depending on an investor\u2019s circumstances, FIFO may not be the best method for holders of Preferred Stock. In some cases, it might be more beneficial for holders of Series A Preferred to report average cost or use another permitted method of cost basis reporting. However, holders of Series A Preferred will not be able to elect any method other than FIFO to report their sales information to the IRS. As a result, sellers of Series A Preferred may be required to pay more tax on their sales or to pay taxes earlier than might have been required if other methods of cost basis reporting had been available.\nAdditional Specific Risks We Face\nWe have a history of significant losses. If we do not maintain profitability, our financial condition and our stock price could suffer.\nWe have a history of losses, and we may incur operating and net losses in the foreseeable future. At December 31, 2016, our accumulated deficit was $153.9 million. We need to generate significant revenues to maintain profitability, and we may not be able to do so. Although we have generated positive net income in recent years, we incurred a net loss for 2011, and interim net losses during 2015 and 2016. We may be unable to maintain profitability in the future. If our revenues grow more slowly than we anticipate or decline, or if our expenses exceed our expectations, our financial results would be harmed and our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could fall below the expectations of public market analysts and investors. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we fail to accurately forecast our expenses and revenues, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations may suffer and the price of our securities may decline.\nThe rapidly evolving nature of our industry and the constantly evolving nature of our business make forecasting operating results difficult. We periodically implement large, complex and expensive infrastructure upgrades in order to increase our ability to handle larger volumes of sales and to develop or increase our ability to perform a variety of analytical procedures relating to our business. We are continuing to upgrade and further expand these and other components of our infrastructure, and are in the process of integrating infrastructure relating to the fintech company and broker-dealers we recently acquired. In the past, we have experienced difficulties with upgrades of our infrastructure, and have incurred increased expenses as a result of these difficulties. As a result of expenditures on our infrastructure and headquarters, our ability to reduce our expenditures is and will be limited. Therefore, any significant shortfall in the revenues for which we have built and are continuing to build our business could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur insurance coverage and indemnity rights may not adequately protect us against loss.\nThe types, coverage, or the amounts of any insurance coverage we may carry from time to time may not be adequate to compensate us for any losses we may actually incur in the operation of our business. Further, any insurance we may desire to purchase may not be available to us on terms we find acceptable or at all. We are not indemnified by all of our suppliers, and any indemnification rights we may have may not be enforceable or adequate to cover actual losses we may incur as a result of our sales of their products. Actual losses for which we are not insured or indemnified, or which exceed our insurance coverage or the capacity of our indemnitors or our ability to enforce our indemnity agreements, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe face risks relating to our inventory.\nIn our direct business, we sell merchandise that we have purchased and hold in inventory. We assume the risks of inventory damage, theft and obsolescence, as well as risks of price erosion for these products. These risks are especially significant because some of the merchandise we sell is characterized by seasonal trends, fashion trends, rapid technological change, obsolescence and price erosion, and because we sometimes make large purchases of particular types of inventory. Demand for our products is generally highly sensitive to price. If we fail to meet our customers\u2019 price expectations, or if we are unable to compete effectively with our competitors when they engage in aggressive pricing strategies or other competitive activities, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nSubject to our returns policies, we accept returns of products sold through our partners as well as products we sell in our direct business, and we have the risk of reselling the returned products. In the past we have recorded charges for obsolete inventory and have had to sell certain merchandise at a discount or loss. To the extent that we rely on purchased inventory, our success will depend on our ability to sell our inventory rapidly, the ability of our buying staff to purchase inventory at attractive prices relative to its resale value and our ability to manage customer returns and other costs. If we are unsuccessful in any of these areas, we may be forced to sell our inventory at a discount or loss. Further, we purchase some of our inventory from foreign suppliers and pay for inventory with U.S. dollars. If the dollar weakens with respect to foreign currencies, foreign\nsuppliers may require us to pay higher prices for products, which could negatively affect our profit margins. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we do not successfully optimize and operate our warehouse and customer service operations, our business could be harmed.\nWe have expanded, contracted and otherwise modified our warehouse and customer service operations from time to time in the past, and expect that we will continue to do so. We also contract with third parties to receive returns and process orders. If we or our third party providers do not successfully optimize and operate our warehouse and customer service operations, it could significantly limit our ability to meet customer demand, customer shipping or return time expectations, or result in excessive costs and expenses for the size of our business. Because it is difficult to predict demand, we may not manage our facilities in an optimal way, which may result in excess or insufficient inventory or warehousing capacity. We may also fail to staff our fulfillment and customer service centers at optimal levels. Our failure to do so could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience, and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe seasonality of our business places increased strain on our operations.\nA disproportionate amount of our sales normally occur during our fourth quarter. If we do not stock or are otherwise unable to source products sufficient to meet customer demand, our business would be adversely affected. We may experience an increase in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades, split-shipments, and additional long-zone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season. In addition, we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment and customer service centers during peak periods, and delivery services and other fulfillment companies and customer service providers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nSignificant merchandise returns could harm our business.\nWe allow our customers to return products, subject to our returns policies. If merchandise returns are higher than we anticipate, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. Further, we modify our policies relating to returns from time to time, and policies intended to reduce the number of product returns may result in customer dissatisfaction and/or fewer repeat customers. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nChanges in management roles and responsibilities, the loss of key personnel, or any inability to attract and retain additional personnel could affect our ability to successfully grow our business.\nOur performance is substantially dependent on the continued services and on the performance of our senior management and other key personnel. Our performance also depends on our ability to retain and motivate our officers and key employees. Changes in the roles and responsibilities of certain members of management or the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees for any reason could harm our business. Occasionally, members of senior management or key employees may find it necessary to take a leave of absence due to medical or other causes. In early 2013 our Chief Executive Officer and then Chairman of the Board, Dr. Patrick M. Byrne, took a two-month personal leave of absence for medical reasons, and in April 2016 he took a three-month personal leave of absence for medical reasons. We do not have employment agreements with any of our key personnel and we do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance policies. Our future success also depends on our ability to identify, attract, hire, train, retain and motivate other highly-skilled technical, managerial, editorial, merchandising, marketing and customer service personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense. Our failure to attract and retain the necessary personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn order to obtain future revenue growth and sustain profitability, we must attract and retain customers on cost-effective terms.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract and retain customers on cost-effective terms. We have relationships with online services, search engines, affiliate marketing websites, directories and other website and e-commerce businesses to provide content, advertising and other links that direct customers to our Website. We rely on these relationships as significant sources of traffic to our Website and to generate new customers. In the past we have terminated affiliate marketing websites as a result of efforts by certain states to require us to collect sales taxes based on the presence of those third party Internet advertising affiliates in those states, and we are likely to do so again in the future if necessary. If we are unable to develop or maintain these relationships, or develop and maintain new relationships for newly developed and necessary marketing services on acceptable terms, our ability to attract new customers and our financial condition would suffer. In addition, certain of our\nonline marketing agreements may require us to pay upfront fees and make other payments prior to the realization of the sales, if any, associated with those payments. Current or future relationships or agreements may fail to produce the sales that we anticipate. We periodically conduct television and radio branding and advertising campaigns. Such campaigns are expensive and may not result in the cost-effective acquisition of customers. Other means of utilizing social media campaigns to attract or retain customers are expensive and may not result in cost-effective acquisition or retention of customers. The occurrence of any of the foregoing risks or our inability to attract and retain customers on cost-effective terms could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nMobile commerce and our Club O offerings are becoming increasingly significant to us.\nMobile commerce and our Club O offerings are becoming increasingly significant to us. Customers who use mobile devices and customers who join Club O may behave differently from our other customers. For example, the conversion rate of purchases from mobile devices is lower than from other sources. If our mobile customers or our Club O customers are less profitable to us than our other customers, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.", "PERMNO": 89394, "SIC": 5961, "TIC": "OSTK"}
