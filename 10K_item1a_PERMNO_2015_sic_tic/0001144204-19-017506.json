{"cik": "1747079", "company": "Twin River Worldwide Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-04-01", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report, the following Risk Factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business.\nIf any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. If this were to happen, the value of our securities, including our common stock, could decline significantly, and investors could lose all or part of their investment.\nIncreased competition could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nVarious competitive properties have opened or will be opening in the future that may affect our flagship casino in Rhode Island, and perhaps our Tiverton property as well. In November 2011, the Expanded Gaming Act was signed into law in Massachusetts, which allowed up to three commercial destination resort casinos located in three geographically diverse regions across the state and a single slots facility for one location statewide. In February 2014, the MGC awarded the slots-only gaming license to Plainridge Park Casino in Plainville, Massachusetts which opened in June 2015. In the third quarter of 2018, MGM Resorts International opened the $1.0 billion Springfield resort casino in Springfield, Massachusetts, and the $2.5 billion Encore Boston Harbor is scheduled to open in June 2019. We have taken various steps designed to increase our competitive position, including building a hotel adjacent to our Twin River casino property in Lincoln, Rhode Island, near Providence, Rhode Island, constructing a new facility in Tiverton, Rhode Island and obtaining regulatory approvals for changes in gaming operations. There can be no assurance that these steps will be effective, or what the ultimate effect of this additional competition will be. In addition, the Massachusetts law allows the MGC at its discretion to award one additional commercial casino license, limited to the southeast region of the Commonwealth. The MGC solicited public comment late in 2018 on this issue as it continues to evaluate whether to issue such license. Finally, construction of a tribal casino in Taunton, Massachusetts is currently on hold following a U.S. Department of the Interior ruling in September 2018 regarding the validity of the tribe\u2019s land in trust taking. The tribe has initiated litigation challenging this decision in the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts. Further, companion Senate and House bills have been introduced in Congress that would award the land in trust to the tribe and prevent any further litigation, including pending cases, with regard to its status. The outcome of this litigation and the likelihood of the proposed legislation is inherently uncertain.\nOur business is particularly sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending.\nConsumer demand for casinos and casino hotel properties, such as ours, is sensitive to downturns in the economy and the associated impact on discretionary spending on leisure activities. Any adverse change in general economic conditions can adversely affect consumer spending, which can adversely affect our ability to generate revenues from operations. Adverse developments affecting economies throughout the world including a general tightening of the availability of credit, increasing energy costs, rising prices, inflation, acts of war or terrorism, natural disasters, declining consumer confidence or significant declines in the stock market could lead to a reduction in discretionary spending on entertainment and leisure activities, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRecessions have affected our business and financial condition, and economic conditions may continue to affect them in ways that currently cannot accurately be predicted.\nEconomic recessions have had, and may continue to have, far reaching adverse consequences across many industries, including the gaming industry, which may adversely affect our business and financial condition. In the past decade, the U.S. economy has experienced weakness and recession following a financial crisis, which resulted in increased unemployment, decreased consumer spending and a decline in housing values. In addition, while the Federal Reserve took policy actions to promote market liquidity and encourage economic growth following such recession, such actions are now being curtailed as signs of improvement in the economy, and the impact of these monetary policy actions on the national economy is uncertain. Moreover, we will rely on the strength of regional and local economies for the performance of each of our properties. If the national economic recovery slows or stalls, the national economy experiences another recession or any of the relevant regional or local economies suffers a downturn, we may experience a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe gaming industry is very competitive and increased competition, including through legislative legalization or expansion of gaming by states in or near where we own facilities or through Native American gaming facilities and internet gaming, could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe will face significant competition in all of the areas in which we conduct our business. Increased competitive pressures may adversely affect our ability to continue to attract customers or affect our ability to compete efficiently.\nSeveral of the facilities where we conduct our business are located in jurisdictions that restrict gaming to certain areas and/or may be affected by state laws that currently prohibit or restrict gaming operations. We also face the risk that existing casino licensees will expand their operations and the risk that Native American gaming will continue to grow. Budgetary pressures faced by state governments could lead to intensified political pressures for the legalization of gaming in jurisdictions where it is currently prohibited. The legalization of gaming in such jurisdictions could be an expansion opportunity for our business, or create competitive pressures, depending on where the legalization occurs and our ability to capitalize on it. Our ability to attract customers to the existing casinos which we own could be significantly and adversely affected by the legalization or expansion of gaming in certain jurisdictions and by the development or expansion of Native American casinos in areas where our customers may visit.\nIn addition, our competitors may refurbish, rebrand or expand their casino offerings, which could result in increased competition. Furthermore, changes in ownership may result in improved quality of our competitors\u2019 facilities, which may make such facilities more competitive.\nWe also compete with other forms of legalized gaming and entertainment such as bingo, pull-tab games, card parlors, sports books, pari-mutuel or simulcast betting on horse and dog racing, state-sponsored lotteries, instant racing machines, video lottery terminals (\u201cVLTs\u201d) (including racetracks that offer VLTs), video poker terminals and, in the future, we may compete with gaming or entertainment at other venues. Furthermore, competition from internet lotteries and other internet wagering gaming services, which allow their customers to wager on a wide variety of sporting events and play Las Vegas-style casino games from home, could divert customers from the facilities we own and thus adversely affect our business. Such internet wagering services are likely to expand in future years and become more accessible to domestic gamblers as a result of U.S. Department of Justice positions related to the application of federal laws to intrastate internet gaming and initiatives in some states to consider legislation to legalize intrastate internet wagering. The law in this area has been rapidly evolving, and additional legislative developments may occur at the federal and state levels that would accelerate the proliferation of certain forms of internet gaming in the United States.\nIn addition, in May 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down as unconstitutional the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992, a federal statute enacted to stop the spread of state-sponsored sports gambling. This decision has the effect of lifting federal restrictions on sports wagering and thus allows states to determine by themselves the legality of sports wagering. While new federal online gaming legislation has been introduced in Congress from time to time, there has been no federal legislative response to the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision.\nAs a result, Washington D.C., Nevada, Delaware, Mississippi, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, West Virginia, New Mexico and Arkansas have passed legislation authorizing fixed-odds sports betting. Our Rhode Island, Delaware and Mississippi properties now offer sports wagering pursuant to state law in each case.\nWe may also face competition from other gaming facilities which are able to offer sports wagering services following the enactment of applicable legislation. A law authorizing sports betting in New York was enacted in 2013, but regulations to implement that law have yet to be promulgated, and a measure to allow for full-scale sports betting failed in June 2018. Numerous states that border the states in which we operate have pending or proposed legislation which would allow for sports betting, including Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maryland, Louisiana, Tennessee, Oklahoma and Kansas, each of which could have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nOur gaming operations will rely heavily on technology services provided by third parties. In the event that there is an interruption of these services, it may have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nWe, or one of our state regulatory bodies, engage a number of third parties to provide gaming operating systems for the facilities we own. As a result, we rely on such third parties to provide uninterrupted services in order to run our business efficiently and effectively. In the event one of these third parties experiences a disruption in its ability to provide such services (whether due to technological or financial difficulties or power problems), this may result in a material disruption at the casinos which we own and have a material effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nAny unscheduled interruption in our technology services is likely to result in an immediate, and possibly substantial, loss of revenues due to a shutdown of our gaming operations, cloud computing and lottery systems. Such interruptions may occur as a result of, for example, catastrophic events or rolling blackouts. Our systems are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, telecommunication failures, hurricanes, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks and similar events.\nWe are subject to extensive state and local regulation and licensing, and gaming authorities have significant control over our operations, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nThe ownership and operation of casino gaming and horse racing facilities are subject to extensive state and local regulation, and regulatory authorities at the state and local levels have broad powers with respect to the licensing of these businesses, and may revoke, suspend, condition, fail to renew or limit our gaming or other licenses, impose substantial fines and take other actions, each of which poses a significant risk to our business, results of operations and financial condition. We currently hold all state and local licenses and related approvals necessary to conduct our present operations, but must periodically apply to renew many of these licenses and registrations and have the suitability of certain of our directors, officers and employees renewed. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such renewals or that we will be able to obtain future approvals that would allow us to expand our gaming operations. Any failure to maintain or renew existing licenses, registrations, permits or approvals would have a material adverse effect on us. Furthermore, if additional gaming laws or regulations are adopted, these regulations could impose additional restrictions or costs that could have a significant adverse effect on us.\nAny of the Rhode Island Department of Business Regulation and the Division of Lotteries of the Rhode Island Department of Revenue, the Mississippi Gaming Commission, the Delaware Gaming Commission or the Colorado Racing Commission may, in their discretion, require certain holders of any securities issued by us to file applications, be investigated and be found suitable to own our securities if it has reason to believe that the security ownership would be inconsistent with the declared policies of its respective state. The Rhode Island regulatory authorities limit the ability of third parties to acquire (1) 5% or more of our common stock, unless the stockholder has been granted a gaming license or the ownership is otherwise approved by the Rhode Island regulatory authorities, (2) 20% or more of our outstanding common stock, unless the acquiring stockholder has been granted a gaming license by the Rhode Island regulatory authorities or such ownership is otherwise approved or (3) as to passive institutional investors, generally 15% or more of our common stock, but in all cases the amount approved by the Rhode Island regulatory authorities with respect to that investor.\nThe Delaware regulatory authorities will limit the ability of third parties to acquire 10% or more of our common stock, or, as to passive institutional investors, up to 15% of our common stock, unless the acquiring stockholder has been granted a license by the Delaware regulatory authorities or such ownership is otherwise approved. The Delaware regulatory authorities recently adopted regulations substantially similar to those in effect in Rhode Island permitting a waiver for institutional shareholders who own up to 15% of a regulated company. The costs of any investigation conducted by any of these or other gaming authorities under these circumstances must be paid by the applicant, and refusal or failure to pay these charges may constitute grounds for a finding that the applicant is unsuitable to own the securities. If any of these or other gaming authorities determines that a person is unsuitable to own our securities, then, under the applicable gaming or horse racing laws and regulations, we could be sanctioned, including the loss of approvals, if, without the prior approval of the applicable gaming authority, we conduct certain business with the unsuitable person.\nOur officers, directors and key employees will also be subject to a variety of regulatory requirements and various licensing and related approval procedures in the various jurisdictions in which we manage gaming facilities. If any applicable gaming authority were to find any of our officers, directors, or key employees unsuitable for licensing or unsuitable to continue having a relationship with it, we would have to sever all relationships with that person. Furthermore, the applicable gaming authority may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications. Either result could adversely affect our gaming operations.\nApplicable gaming laws and regulations may restrict our ability to issue certain securities, incur debt and undertake other financing activities. Such transactions would generally require notice and/or approval of applicable gaming authorities, and our financing counterparties, including lenders, might be subject to various licensing and related approval procedures in the various jurisdictions in which we manage gaming facilities. Applicable gaming laws further limit our ability to engage in certain competitive activities and impose requirements relating to the composition of our Board and senior management personnel. If state regulatory authorities were to find any person unsuitable with regard to his, her or its relationship to us or any of our subsidiaries, we would be required to sever our relationship with that person, which could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to numerous other federal, state and local laws that may expose us to liabilities or have a significant adverse impact on our operations. Changes to any such laws could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to a variety of other federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and ordinances. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, environmental matters, employees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, and marketing and advertising. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Changes to any of the laws, rules, regulations or ordinances to which we are subject, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could have a adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nMany of our employees, especially those that interact with our customers, receive a base salary or wage that is established by applicable state and federal laws that establish a minimum hourly wage that is, in turn, supplemented through tips and gratuities from customers. From time to time, state and federal lawmakers have increased the minimum wage. It is difficult to predict when such increases may take place. Any such change to the minimum wage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages is a highly regulated and taxed business. Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the production and distribution of beer, including permitting, licensing, trade practices, labeling, advertising, marketing, distributor relationships and related matters. Federal, state and local governmental entities also levy various taxes, license fees, and other similar charges and may require bonds to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Failure to comply with applicable federal, state or local laws and regulations could result in higher taxes, penalties, fees, and suspension or revocation of permits, licenses or approvals and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. From time to time, local and state lawmakers, as well as special interest groups, have proposed legislation that would increase the federal and/or state excise tax on alcoholic beverages or certain types of alcoholic beverages. If federal or state excise taxes are increased, we may have to raise prices to maintain our current profit margins. Higher taxes may reduce overall demand for beer, thus negatively impacting sales of our beer. Further federal or state regulation may be forthcoming that could further restrict the distribution and sale of alcohol products. Any material increases in taxes or fees, or the adoption of additional taxes, fees or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIn addition, each restaurant we operate must obtain a food service license from local authorities. Failure to comply with such regulations could cause our licenses to be revoked or our related restaurant business or businesses to be forced to cease operations. Moreover, state liquor laws may prevent the expansion of restaurant operations into certain markets.\nAny violation of applicable anti-money laundering laws or regulations could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe handle significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. Recently, U.S. governmental authorities have evidenced an increased focus on compliance with anti-money laundering laws and regulations in the gaming industry. Any violation of anti-money laundering laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Internal control policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs that we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not be effective in prohibiting our employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing our policies and the law. If we or our employees or agents fail to comply with applicable laws or our policies governing our operations, we may face investigations, prosecutions and other legal proceedings and actions which could result in civil penalties, administrative remedies and criminal sanctions. Any such government investigations, prosecutions or other legal proceedings or actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nFailure to comply with the terms of the Regulatory Agreement could result in a breach and could harm our business.\nWe are currently a party to the Regulatory Agreement with Rhode Island regulatory agencies. The Regulatory Agreement imposes certain affirmative and negative covenants on us. For more detail on the Regulatory Agreement see the section entitled \u201cGovernmental Regulation\u201d in \u201cItem I. Business.\u201d A failure to comply with the provisions in the Regulatory Agreement could subject us to injunctive or monetary relief, payments to the Rhode Island regulatory agencies and ultimately the revocation or suspension of our licenses to operate in Rhode Island. Any such remedy could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Among other things, the Regulatory Agreement prohibits us and our subsidiaries from owning, operating, managing or providing gaming specific goods and services to any gaming facilities in Rhode Island (other than Twin River Casino Hotel and Tiverton Casino Hotel), Massachusetts, Connecticut or New Hampshire, which may adversely affect our growth and market opportunity in those states.\nOur VLTs and table games hold percentages may fluctuate.\nThe gaming industry is characterized by an element of chance and our casino guests\u2019 winnings depend on a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control. In addition to the element of chance, hold percentages are affected by other factors, including players\u2019 skill and experience, the mix of games played, the financial resources of players, the volume of bets placed and the amount of time played. The variability of our hold percentages has the potential to adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe conduct our business in an industry that is subject to high taxes and may be subject to higher taxes in the future.\nIn gaming jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, with the exception of Rhode Island, state and local governments raise considerable revenues from taxes based on casino revenues and operations. In Rhode Island, the state takes all of the gaming win that comes into our Rhode Island operations and then pays us a percentage of the gaming win. We will also pay property taxes, occupancy taxes, sales and use taxes, payroll taxes, franchise taxes and income taxes. Our profitability will depend on generating enough revenues to cover variable expenses, such as payroll and marketing, as well as largely fixed expenses, such as property taxes and interest expense. From time to time, state and local governments have increased gaming taxes and such increases could significantly impact the profitability of gaming operations.\nOur operations in Delaware, Colorado and Mississippi are generally subject to significant revenue-based taxes and fees in addition to normal federal, state and local income taxes, and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time. In addition, from time to time, federal, state and local legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws, or in the administration of such laws, affecting the gaming industry. Further, worsening economic conditions could intensify the efforts of Delaware, Colorado and Mississippi and applicable local governments to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes and/or property taxes. It is not possible to determine with certainty the likelihood of changes in tax laws in these jurisdictions or in the administration of such laws. Such changes, if adopted, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The large number of state and local governments with significant current or projected budget deficits makes it more likely that those governments that currently permit gaming will seek to fund such deficits with new or increased gaming taxes and/or property taxes and worsening economic conditions could intensify those efforts. Any material increase, or the adoption of additional taxes or fees, could adversely affect our future financial results.\nThere can be no assurance that governments in jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, or the federal government, will not enact legislation that increases gaming tax rates. General economic pressures have the potential to reduce revenues of state governments from traditional tax sources, which may cause state legislatures or the federal government to be more inclined to increase gaming tax rates.\nWe are subject to risks associated with labor relations, labor costs and labor disruptions.\nWe are subject to the costs and risks generally associated with labor disputes and organizing activities related to unionized labor. From time to time, our operations may be disrupted by strikes, public demonstrations or other coordinated actions and publicity. We may incur increased legal costs and indirect labor costs as a result of contractual disputes, negotiations or other labor-related disruptions. We have collective bargaining agreements applicable to approximately 38% of our employees as of March 28, 2019. We have 12 collective bargaining agreements with terms ranging between three\u2009to\u2009five years generally. These agreements are based solely in Rhode Island. We may also face organizing activities that could result in additional employees becoming unionized. Furthermore, collective bargaining agreements may limit our ability to reduce the size of our workforce during an economic downturn, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nOur obligation to fund multiemployer defined benefit plans to which we are a party adversely affect us.\nWe must contribute to a number of multiemployer defined benefit pension plans under the terms of collective-bargaining agreements that cover certain union-represented employees. The risks of participating in these multiemployer plans are different from single-employer plans in the following aspects:\n\u00b7 assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers;\n\u00b7 if a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers; and\n\u00b7 if we choose to stop participating in some of our multiemployer plans, we may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability.\nIn addition, the funding obligations for our pension plans will be impacted by the performance of the financial markets, particularly the equity markets, and interest rates. Funding obligations are determined by government regulations and are measured each year based on the value of assets and liabilities on a specific date. If the financial markets do not provide the long-term returns that are expected, we could be required to make larger contributions. The equity markets can be very volatile and, therefore, our estimate of future contribution requirements can change dramatically in relatively short periods of time. Similarly, changes in interest rates and legislation enacted by governmental authorities can impact the timing and amounts of contribution requirements. An adverse change in the funded status of the plans could significantly increase our required contributions in the future and adversely impact our liquidity.\nThe casino, hotel and hospitality industry is capital intensive and we may not be able to finance development, expansion and renovation projects, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nOur casino and hotel properties have an ongoing need for renovations and other capital improvements to remain competitive, including room refurbishments, amenity upgrades, and replacement, from time to time, of furniture, fixtures and equipment. We may also need to make capital expenditures to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Construction projects entail significant risks, which can substantially increase costs or delay completion of a project. Such risks include shortages of materials or skilled labor, unforeseen engineering, environmental or geological problems, work stoppages, weather interference and unanticipated cost increases. Most of these factors are beyond our control. In addition, difficulties or delays in obtaining any of the requisite licenses, permits or authorizations from regulatory authorities can increase the cost or delay the completion of an expansion or development. Significant budget overruns or delays with respect to expansion and development projects could adversely affect our business, and our results of operations.\nRenovations and other capital improvements of casino properties in particular require significant capital expenditures. In addition, any such renovations and capital improvements usually generate little or no cash flow until the projects are completed. We may not be able to fund such projects solely from cash provided from operating activities. Consequently, we may have to rely upon the availability of debt or equity capital to fund renovations and capital improvements, and our ability to carry them out will be limited if we cannot obtain satisfactory debt or equity financing, which will depend on, among other things, market conditions. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional equity or debt financing on favorable terms or at all. Our failure to renovate and maintain gaming and entertainment venues from time to time may put us at a competitive disadvantage to gaming and entertainment venues offering more modern and better maintained facilities, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nBecause we will be heavily dependent upon hotel/casino and related operations that are conducted in certain limited regions, we will be subject to greater risks than a company that is geographically or otherwise more diversified.\nWe are heavily dependent upon hotel/casino and related operations that are conducted in Rhode Island, Mississippi, and Delaware for all of our cash flow. As a result, we are subject to a greater degree of risk than a gaming company that has greater geographical diversity. The risks to which we may have a greater degree of exposure include the following:\n\u00b7 local economic and competitive conditions;\n\u00b7 inaccessibility due to weather conditions, road construction or closure of primary access routes;\n\u00b7 changes in local and state governmental laws and regulations, including gaming laws and regulations;\n\u00b7 natural and other disasters, including earthquakes, hurricanes and flooding;\n\u00b7 a decline in the number of residents in or near, or visitors to, our operations;\n\u00b7 an increase in gaming activities in neighboring jurisdictions; and\n\u00b7 a decrease in gaming activities at any of our facilities.\nAny of the factors outlined above could adversely affect our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to make payments on our outstanding indebtedness.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits from our acquisitions, including our Merger with Dover Downs.\nWe cannot assure you that our Merger with Dover Downs, our proposed acquisition in Black Hawk, Colorado, or any future acquisitions will enhance our financial performance. Our ability to achieve the expected benefits of any acquisitions will depend on, among other things, our ability to effectively translate our strategies into revenue, our ability to retain and assimilate the acquired businesses' employees, our ability to retain customers and suppliers on terms similar to those in place with the acquired businesses, the adequacy of our implementation plans, our ability to maintain our financial and internal controls and systems as we expand our operations, the ability of our management to oversee and operate effectively the combined operations and our ability to achieve desired operating efficiencies and revenue goals. The integration of the businesses that we acquire might also cause us to incur unforeseen costs, which would lower our future earnings and would prevent us from realizing the expected benefits of such acquisitions. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results including, ultimately, a reduction in our stock price.\nOur acquisition strategy may adversely affect our business.\nA portion of our past growth has been achieved through acquisitions of, or mergers with, other gaming companies. We also continually evaluate opportunities to acquire other companies. We believe that there are risks related to acquiring companies, including an inability to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates or consummate such potential acquisitions. To the extent that our future growth includes acquisitions, we cannot assure you that we will not overpay for acquisitions, we may lose key employees of acquired companies, or we may fail to achieve potential synergies or successful expansion into new markets as a result of our acquisitions. Therefore, future acquisitions, if any, may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, particularly in periods immediately following the consummation of those transactions while the operations of the acquired business are being integrated with our operations. Achieving the benefits of acquisitions depends on timely, efficient and successful execution of a number of post-acquisition events, including, among other things:\n\u00b7 maintaining the customer and supplier base;\n\u00b7 optimizing operations;\n\u00b7 coordinating administrative and finance functions; and\n\u00b7 integrating management information systems and personnel.\nThe integration process could divert the attention of management. Any difficulties or problems encountered in the transition process could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In particular, the integration process may temporarily redirect resources previously focused on increasing profitability. In addition, the process of combining companies could cause the interruption of, or a loss of momentum and operating profits in, the activities of the respective businesses, which could have an adverse effect on their combined operations.\nIn connection with acquisitions of businesses in the future, if any, we may decide to consolidate the operations of any acquired businesses with our existing operations or make other changes with respect to the acquired businesses, which could result in special charges or other expenses. Our results of operations also may be adversely affected by expenses we incur in making acquisitions, by amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets with definite lives and by additional depreciation and amortization attributable to acquired assets. Any of the businesses we acquire may also have liabilities or adverse operating issues, including some that we fail to discover before the acquisition, and our indemnity for such liabilities may also be limited. Additionally, our ability to make any future acquisitions may depend upon obtaining additional financing. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms or at all. To the extent that we seek to acquire other businesses in exchange for our common stock, fluctuations in our stock price could adversely affect on our ability to complete acquisitions.\nWe may incur impairments to goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, or long-lived assets.\nWe monitor the recoverability of our long-lived assets, such as buildings, and evaluate their carrying value for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable. We annually review goodwill to determine if impairment has occurred. Additionally, interim reviews are performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record a non-cash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value and fair value of the long-lived assets or the carrying value and fair value of the reporting unit, in the period the determination is made. The testing of long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment requires us to make estimates that are subject to significant assumptions about our future revenue, profitability, cash flows, fair value of assets and liabilities, weighted average cost of capital, as well as other assumptions. Changes in these estimates, or changes in actual performance compared with these estimates, may affect the fair value of long-lived assets or reporting unit, which may result in an impairment charge.\nWe cannot accurately predict the amount or timing of any impairment of assets. Should the value of long-lived assets or goodwill become impaired, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur debt agreements contain restrictive covenants that may limit our operating flexibility.\nOur current credit facility includes, and our future debt agreements will likely include, financial and other covenants. Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by general economic conditions, industry conditions and other events beyond our control. There can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with these covenants. The failure to comply with a financial covenant or other restrictions contained in the agreements governing such indebtedness, may result in an event of default. An event of default could result in acceleration of some or all of the applicable indebtedness and the inability to borrow additional funds. We do not have, and cannot be certain we would be able to obtain, sufficient funds to repay any such indebtedness if it is accelerated. Additionally, our future debt agreements might contain numerous covenants imposing financial and operating restrictions on our business. These restrictions might affect our ability to operate our business, might limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise and might adversely affect the conduct of our current business, including by restricting our ability to finance future operations and capital needs and limiting our ability to engage in other business activities.\nOur existing and future indebtedness may limit our operating and financial flexibility.\nAt the close of the Merger, we had approximate indebtedness of\u2009$422.4 million, substantially all of which is secured indebtedness. This indebtedness may have important negative consequences for us, including:\n\u00b7 limiting our ability to satisfy obligations;\n\u00b7 increasing vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u00b7 limiting flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the markets in which we conduct business;\n\u00b7 increasing vulnerability to, and limiting our ability to react to, changing market conditions, changes in industry and economic downturns;\n\u00b7 limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures, debt service, general corporate or other obligations;\n\u00b7 subjecting us to a number of restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to pay dividends and distributions, make acquisitions and dispositions, borrow additional funds and make capital expenditures and other investments;\n\u00b7 limiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a significant portion of these funds to make principal and/or interest payments on outstanding debt;\n\u00b7 exposing us to interest rate risk due to the variable interest rate on borrowings under our credit facility;\n\u00b7 causing our failure to comply with the financial and restrictive covenants contained in our current or future indebtedness, which could cause a default under that indebtedness and which, if not cured or waived, could adversely affect us; and\n\u00b7 affecting our ability to renew gaming and other licenses necessary to conduct our business.\nServicing debt and funding other obligations requires a significant amount of cash, and our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors, some of which will be beyond our control.\nOur ability to make payments on and refinance our indebtedness and to fund our operations and capital expenditures depends upon our ability to generate cash flow and secure financing in the future. Our ability to generate future cash flow depends, among other things, upon:\n\u00b7 our future operating performance;\n\u00b7 general economic conditions;\n\u00b7 competition;\n\u00b7 legislative and regulatory factors affecting our operations and businesses; and\n\u00b7 our future operating performance.\nSome of these factors will be beyond our control. There can be no assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations or that future debt or equity financings will be available to us to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund other needs. The inability to generate cash flow could result in us needing to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. If needed, there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all. Any inability to generate sufficient cash flow or refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms could adversely affect our financial condition.\nA market downturn may negatively impact our access to financing.\nSince emergence from a recession approximately ten years ago, the U.S. economy has been expanding at various growth rates. Such growth could slow, or reverse, and another economic downturn could occur. Some believe that the equity markets are currently overvalued. A downturn in the financial markets or market volatility could negatively impact our ability to access capital and financing (including financing necessary to refinance our existing indebtedness) on acceptable terms and prices, that we would otherwise need in connection with the operation of our business.\nThe market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly.\nThere have been periods of time when the U.S. securities markets have experienced significant price fluctuations. These price fluctuations may be day-to-day or they may last for extended periods of time. Significant price fluctuations in the securities markets as a whole may cause the market price of our common stock to be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. Prior to the Merger, we were a privately held company without an active public market for our shares. We believe that some shareholders desire to sell shares that they have held for a substantial period of time. The trading volume of our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. Additional factors that could cause fluctuations in, or adversely affect, our stock price or trading volume include:\n\u00b7 general market and economic conditions, including market conditions in the gaming and hotel industries;\n\u00b7 actual or expected variations in quarterly operating results;\n\u00b7 differences between actual operating results and those expected by investors and analysts;\n\u00b7 sales of our common stock by current shareholders seeking liquidity in the public market;\n\u00b7 changes in recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u00b7 operations and stock performance of competitors;\n\u00b7 accounting charges, including charges relating to the impairment of goodwill;\n\u00b7 significant acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or by competitors;\n\u00b7 sales of our common stock by our directors and officers or significant investors; and\n\u00b7 recruitment or departure of key personnel.\nThere can be no assurance that the stock price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. In addition, the stock market in general can experience considerable price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated to our performance.\nOur largest stockholder owns a meaningful percentage of our outstanding common stock, which could limit the ability of other stockholders to influence corporate matters.\nOur largest stockholder beneficially owns 31.9% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, this stockholder may be able to exert influence over our affairs and policies. This concentrated ownership could limit the ability of the remaining stockholders to influence corporate matters, and the interests of the large stockholder may not coincide with our interests or the interests of the remaining stockholders. The concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control.\nWe have not historically paid dividends, and any decision to do so in the future will be at the discretion of our Board.\nWe have not historically paid regular dividends. However, we expect to pay a quarterly cash dividend initially targeted at approximately 1%, on an annual basis, of the common stock price beginning later this year. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board and will depend upon, among other factors, our earnings, cash requirements, financial condition, requirements to comply with the covenants under our debt instruments and the Regulatory Agreement, legal considerations, and other factors that our Board deems relevant. If we do not pay dividends, then the return on an investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon our future stock price. There is no guarantee that our common stock will maintain its value or appreciate in value.\nWe are a holding company and will depend on our subsidiaries for dividends, distributions and other payments.\nWe are structured as a holding company, a legal entity separate and distinct from our subsidiaries. Our only significant asset is the capital stock or other equity interests of our operating subsidiaries. As a holding company, we will conduct all of our business through our subsidiaries. Consequently, our principal source of cash flow, including cash flow to pay dividends, will be dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries. If our subsidiaries are unable to make dividend payments or distributions to us and sufficient cash or liquidity is not otherwise available, we may not be able to pay dividends. In addition, our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary\u2019s liquidation or reorganization will be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary\u2019s creditors.\nWe are or may become involved in legal proceedings that, if adversely adjudicated or settled, could impact our business and financial condition\nFrom time to time, we are named in lawsuits or other legal proceedings relating to our businesses. In particular, the nature of our business subjects us to the risk of lawsuits filed by customers, past and present employees, stockholders, competitors, business partners and others in the ordinary course of business. As with all legal proceedings, no assurances can be given as to the outcome of these matters. Moreover, legal proceedings can be expensive and time consuming, and we may not be successful in defending or prosecuting these lawsuits, which could result in settlements or damages that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive environmental regulation, which creates uncertainty regarding future environmental expenditures and liabilities.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern activities that may have adverse environmental effects, such as discharges to air and water, as well as the management and disposal of solid, animal and hazardous wastes and exposure to hazardous materials. These laws and regulations, which are complex and subject to change, include United States Environmental Protection Agency regulations. In addition, our horseracing facility in Colorado is subject to state laws and regulations that address the impacts of manure and wastewater generated by Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (\u201cCAFO\u201d) on water quality, including, but not limited to, storm water discharges. CAFO regulations include permit requirements and water quality discharge standards. Enforcement of CAFO regulations has been receiving increased governmental attention. Compliance with these and other environmental laws can, in some circumstances, require significant capital expenditures. For example, we may incur future costs under existing and new laws and regulations pertaining to storm water and wastewater management at our racetracks. Moreover, violations can result in significant penalties and, in some instances, interruption or cessation of operations.\nWe are also subject to laws and regulations that create liability and cleanup responsibility for releases of regulated materials into the environment. Certain of these laws and regulations impose strict, and under certain circumstances joint and several, liability on a current or previous owner or operator of property for the costs of remediating regulated materials on or emanating from our property. The costs of investigation, remediation or removal of those substances may be substantial. The presence of, or failure to remediate properly, such materials may adversely affect the ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow funds using such property as collateral. Additionally, as an owner or manager of real property, we could be subject to claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination at or emanating from third party sites. These laws typically impose clean-up responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or manager knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants and the liability under those laws has been interpreted to be joint and several unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis for allocation of the responsibility. In addition, environmental requirements address the impacts of development on wetlands.\nThe possibility exists that contamination, as yet unknown, may exist on our properties. There can be no assurance that we will not incur expenditures for environmental investigations or remediation in the future.\nWe are largely dependent on the skill and experience of management and key personnel.\nWe expect to experience strong competition in hiring and retaining qualified property and corporate management personnel, including competition from Native American gaming facilities that are not subject to the same taxation regimes as we are and therefore may be willing and able to pay higher rates of compensation. From time to time, a number of vacancies in key corporate and property management positions can be expected. If we are unable to successfully recruit and retain qualified management personnel at our facilities or at the corporate level, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, our officers, directors and key employees are required to file applications with the gaming authorities in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business and are required to be licensed or found suitable by these gaming authorities. If the gaming authorities were to find an officer, director or key employee unsuitable for licensing or unsuitable to continue having a relationship with us, we would have to sever all relationships with that person. Furthermore, the gaming authorities may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications. Either result could significantly impair our operations. The time and effort needed to successfully complete the application process could impact our ability to attract, hire and retain top talent.\nAs an emerging growth company, we intend to take advantage of reduced governance requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, which could result in our common stock being less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act and we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including but not limited to not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We cannot accurately predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock, our stock price may be more volatile and it may be difficult for us to raise additional capital as and when we need it. If we are unable to raise additional capital as and when we need it, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company, which in certain circumstances could be for up to five years. We will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until the earliest of\u2009 (1) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1.07 billion, (2) the date that we become a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which would occur if the market value of our shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, (3) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt during the preceding three-year period and (4) the last day of our fiscal year containing the fifth anniversary of the date on which shares of our common stock became publicly traded in the United States, or December 31, 2024.\nWe expect to incur increased costs and become subject to additional regulations and requirements as a result of being a public company, and our management may be required to devote substantial time to new compliance matters, which could lower our profits or make it more difficult us to run our business.\nAs a public company, we are likely to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we have not incurred historically, and these expenses may increase even more after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d We anticipate incurring costs associated with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related rules implemented by the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange (the \u201cNYSE\u201d) where we are traded. The expenses incurred by public companies generally for reporting and corporate governance purposes have been increasing. We expect these rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly, although we are currently unable to estimate these costs with any degree of certainty. In addition, we will not be a smaller reporting company or a controlled company and, as such will not be able to take advantage of the scaled disclosure requirements. Our management will need to devote a substantial amount of time to ensure that we comply with all of these requirements.\nAs a public company we are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting and any failure to do so may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nFollowing a transition period afforded to companies that were not previously SEC reporting companies, we will be required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to furnish a report by management on, among other things, our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment will need to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. We also will be required to disclose significant changes made in our internal control procedures on a quarterly basis. The process of designing, implementing and testing internal controls over financial reporting is time consuming, costly and complicated. However, for as long as we remain an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act, we intend to take advantage of the exemption permitting us to avoid the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm believes that we had a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting when it prepared financial statements as a private company relating to non-cash stock-based compensation. We remediated the issue in 2018 by retaining an accounting consulting firm to provide additional depth and breadth in our technical accounting and financial reporting capabilities which we intend to continue to retain until our permanent technical accounting resources, most of which have been identified or hired, are fully on-boarded. No assurance can be given as to the timing for us to recruit additional qualified accounting and finance personnel to provide needed levels of expertise in our internal accounting function.\nIf we are unable to successfully remediate any future deficiencies or weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, or if we identify any additional deficiencies or weaknesses, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting could be adversely affected, we may be unable to maintain compliance with securities law requirements regarding timely filing of periodic reports in addition to applicable stock exchange listing requirements, investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting and/or our stock price may decline as a result.\nOur business may be harmed from cyber security risk and we may be subject to legal claims if there is loss, disclosure or misappropriation of or access to our guests\u2019, business partners\u2019 or our own information or other breaches of information security.\nWe make extensive use of online services and centralized data processing, including through third party service providers. We have experienced cyber-attacks, attempts to breach our systems and other similar incidents. The secure maintenance and transmission of customer information will be a critical element of our operations. Our information technology and other systems that maintain and transmit guest information, or those of service providers, business partners or employee information may be compromised by a malicious third party penetration of our network security, or that of a third party service provider or business partner, or impacted by intentional or unintentional actions or inactions by our employees, or those of a third party service provider or business partner. As a result, our guests\u2019 information may be lost, disclosed, accessed or taken without our guests\u2019 consent.\nIn addition, third party service providers and other business partners process and maintain proprietary business information and data related to our employees, guests, suppliers and other business partners. Our information technology and other systems that maintain and transmit this information, or those of service providers or business partners, may also be compromised by a malicious third party penetration of our network security or that of a third party service provider or business partner, or impacted by intentional or unintentional actions or inactions by our employees or those of a third party-service provider or business partner. As a result, our business information, guest, supplier and other business partner data may be lost, disclosed, accessed or taken without consent.\nAny such loss, disclosure or misappropriation of, or access to, guests\u2019 or business partners\u2019 information or other breach of our information security can result in legal claims or legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations and actions, may have a serious impact on our reputation and may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Furthermore, the loss, disclosure or misappropriation of our business information may adversely affect our reputation, business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe are subject to risks relating to mechanical failure.\nAll of our facilities will generally be subject to the risk that operations could be halted for a temporary or extended period of time, as the result of casualty, forces of nature, mechanical failure, or extended or extraordinary maintenance, among other causes. In addition, our gaming operations could be damaged or halted due to extreme weather conditions. These risks are particularly pronounced at our Hard Rock Biloxi property because of its location adjacent to water and the potential for hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.\nOur operations have historically been subject to seasonal variations and quarterly fluctuations in operating results, and we can expect to experience such variations and fluctuations in the future.\nHistorically, our gaming facilities have typically been subject to seasonal variations.\nIn the Rhode Island market, excessive snowfall during the winter months can make travel to Rhode Island casinos more difficult. This often results in significant declines in traffic on major highways and causes a decline in customer volume. Furthermore, management believes that substantially all visitors to the Rhode Island casinos arrive by some form of ground transportation. Therefore, even normal winter weather may cause revenues and cash flows for our Rhode Island operations to be adversely affected.\nIn addition, winter conditions can adversely affect transportation routes in Delaware. As a result, unfavorable seasonal conditions could adversely affect our operations at Dover Downs Hotel & Casino.\nWe may incur property and other losses that are not adequately covered by insurance.\nAlthough we maintain insurance that we believe is customary and appropriate for our business, we cannot assure you that insurance will be available or adequate to cover all losses and damage to which our business or our assets might be subjected. The lack of adequate insurance for certain types or levels of risk could expose us to significant losses in the event that a catastrophe occurred for which we are uninsured or underinsured. Any losses we incur that are not adequately covered by insurance may decrease our future operating income, require us to find replacements or repairs for destroyed property and reduce the funds available for payments of our obligations. We renew our insurance policies on an annual basis. The cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits, further increase our deductibles, or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage.\nOur results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by the occurrence of natural disasters, such as hurricanes, or other catastrophic events, including war and terrorism.\nNatural disasters, such as major hurricanes, typhoons, floods, fires and earthquakes, could adversely affect our business and operating results. Hurricanes are common in the areas in which our Mississippi property is located, and the severity of such natural disasters is unpredictable.\nFor example, in 2005, Hurricane Katrina destroyed the Hard Rock Biloxi before its opening and the property had to be rebuilt. In 2017, customer traffic to the Hard Rock Biloxi was negatively impacted by Hurricanes Harvey and Nate.\nCatastrophic events, such as terrorist attacks in the United States and elsewhere, have had a negative effect on travel and leisure expenditures, including lodging, gaming (in some jurisdictions) and tourism. We cannot accurately predict the extent to which such events may affect us, directly or indirectly, in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain or choose to purchase any insurance coverage with respect to occurrences of terrorist acts and any losses that could result from these acts. If there is a prolonged disruption at our facilities due to natural disasters, terrorist attacks or other catastrophic events, our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to obtain business interruption coverage for casualties resulting from severe weather such as hurricanes, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain casualty insurance coverage at affordable rates, if at all, for casualties resulting from severe weather.", "PERMNO": 18425, "SIC": 7990, "TIC": "TRWH"}
