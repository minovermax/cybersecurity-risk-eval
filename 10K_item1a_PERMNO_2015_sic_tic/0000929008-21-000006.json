{"cik": "929008", "company": "WESCO INTERNATIONAL INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe following factors, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements we make. All forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons working on our behalf are expressly qualified by the following factors. This information should be read in conjunction with Item 7, \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\", Item 7A, \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks\" and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Our Acquisitions, Divestitures and Strategic Initiatives\nWe may not be able to fully realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings of our merger with Anixter.\nOn June 22, 2020, we completed our merger with Anixter. The success of the merger, including anticipated benefits and cost savings, depends on the successful combination and integration of the companies\u2019 businesses. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, higher than expected costs, diversion of management attention, the disruption of either company\u2019s ongoing legacy businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the combined company\u2019s ability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger.\nWe have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, a number of non-recurring costs associated with the merger and combining the operations of the two companies. This includes transaction fees and expenses related to formulating and implementing integration plans, including facilities, systems consolidation and employment-related costs. We continue to assess the magnitude of these costs, and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the two companies\u2019 businesses. Although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, should allow us to offset integration-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all.\nIf we experience difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on us for an undetermined period. In addition, the actual cost savings of the merger could be less than anticipated.\nExpansion into new business activities, industries, product lines or geographic areas could subject the company to increased costs and risks and may not achieve the intended results.\nWe have invested significantly in expanding our e-commerce capabilities and online customer experience. If our efforts to expand our capabilities in this area are not successful, we may not realize the return on our investments as anticipated, or our operating results could be adversely affected by slower than expected sales growth or additional costs. Furthermore, engaging in or significantly expanding business activities in product sourcing, sales and services could subject the company to unexpected costs and risks. Such activities could subject us to increased operating costs, product liability, regulatory requirements and reputational risks. Our expansion into new and existing markets, including manufacturing related or regulated businesses, may present competitive distribution and regulatory challenges that differ from current ones. We may be less familiar with the target customers and may face different or additional risks, as well as increased or unexpected costs, compared to existing operations. Growth into new markets may also bring us into direct competition with companies with whom we have little or no past experience as competitors. To the extent we are reliant upon expansion into new geographic, industry and product markets for growth and do not meet the new challenges posed by such expansion, our future sales growth could be negatively impacted, our operating costs could increase, and our business operations and financial results could be negatively affected.\nOur strategic and operational initiatives are subject to various risks and uncertainties, and we may be unable to implement the initiatives successfully.\nWe are engaged in a number of strategic and operational initiatives designed to optimize costs and improve operational efficiency. Our ability to successfully execute these initiatives is subject to various risks and uncertainties and there can be no assurance regarding the timing of or extent to which we will realize the anticipated benefits, if at all.\nAny future acquisitions that we may undertake will involve a number of inherent risks, any of which could cause us not to realize the anticipated benefits.\nWe have expanded our operations through organic growth and selected acquisitions of businesses and assets, and may seek to do so in the future. Acquisitions involve various inherent risks, including: problems that could arise from the integration of the acquired business; uncertainties in assessing the value, strengths, weaknesses, contingent and other liabilities and potential profitability of acquisition candidates; the potential loss of key employees of an acquired business; the ability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies anticipated to result from an acquisition or other transaction; unanticipated changes in business, industry or general economic conditions that affect the assumptions underlying the acquisition or other transaction rationale; and expansion into new countries or geographic markets where we may be less familiar with operating requirements, target customers and regulatory compliance. Any one or more of these factors could increase our costs or cause us not to realize the benefits anticipated to result from the acquisition of a business or assets.\nRisks Related to the Global Macroeconomic Environment and Our International Operations\nOur global operations expose us to political, economic, legal , currency and other risks.\nWe operate a network of approximately 800 branches, warehouses and sales offices with operations in more than 50 countries. Approximately one-third of our employee population are non-U.S. employees. We derive approximately 26% of our revenues from sales outside of the U.S. As a result, we are subject to additional risks associated with owning and operating businesses in these foreign markets and jurisdictions.\nOperating in the global marketplace exposes us to a number of risks including:\n\u2022geopolitical and security issues, such as armed conflict and civil or military unrest, political instability, terrorist activity and human rights concerns, and\n\u2022natural disasters and public health crises, including pandemics such as COVID-19, and other catastrophic events;\n\u2022global supply chain disruptions and large-scale outages or inefficient provision of services from utilities, transportation, data hosting, or telecommunications providers;\n\u2022abrupt changes in government policies, laws, regulations or treaties, including imposition of export, import, or doing-business regulations, trade sanctions, embargoes or other trade restrictions;\n\u2022tax or tariff increases;\n\u2022government restrictions on, or nationalization of, our operations in any country;\n\u2022changes in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations, including logistical and communication challenges;\n\u2022restrictions on currency movement;\n\u2022challenges in protecting our IP rights in certain countries;\n\u2022local business and cultural factors that differ from our current standards and practices;\n\u2022continuing uncertainty regarding social, political, immigration, and tax and trade policies in the U.S. and abroad;\n\u2022currency exchange rate fluctuations; and\n\u2022other social, political and economic instability, including recessions and other economic crises in other regions.\nAdverse conditions in the global economy and disruptions of financial markets could negatively impact us and our customers.\nOur results of operations are affected by the level of business activity of our customers, which in turn is affected by global economic conditions and market factors impacting the industries and markets that they serve. Certain global economies and markets continue to experience significant uncertainty and volatility, particularly commodity-driven end markets such as oil and gas and metals and mining. Adverse economic conditions or lack of liquidity in these markets, particularly in North America, may adversely affect our revenues and operating results. Economic and financial market conditions may also affect the availability of financing for projects and for our customers' capital or other expenditures, which can result in project delays or cancellations and thus affect demand for our products. There can be no assurance that any governmental responses to economic conditions or disruptions in the financial markets ultimately will stabilize the markets or increase our customers' liquidity or the availability of credit to our customers. Although no single customer accounts for more than 2% of our sales, a payment default by one of our larger customers could have a negative short-term impact on earnings or liquidity. A financial or industry downturn could have an adverse effect on the collectability of our accounts receivable, which could result in longer payment cycles, increased collection costs and defaults. Should one or more of our larger customers declare bankruptcy, it could adversely affect the collectability of our accounts receivable, along with credit loss reserves and net income. In addition, our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to do so. The economic, political and financial environment may also affect our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict, and there can be no assurance that economic and political instability, both domestically and internationally (for example, resulting from changes to trade policies, tariffs or participation in trade agreements or economic and political unions) will not adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows or financial position in the future.\nOur business and operations have been and will continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the duration and extent to which it will affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, and stock price remains uncertain.\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic has created significant disruption to the broader economies, financial markets, workforces, business environment, and our suppliers and customers. It began to adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition late in the first quarter of 2020 and is continuing, and the effects include lost or delayed revenue to us. The pandemic has caused significant disruptions to our business due to, among other things, reduced transportation, restrictions on travel, disruptions to our suppliers and global supply chain, the impact on our customers and their demand for our products and services and ability to pay for them, as well as temporary closures of facilities. Some of the actions we have taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as implementing remote working arrangements, may also create increased vulnerability to cybersecurity incidents and other risks.\nThe duration and extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition depends on many evolving factors and future developments for which there is significant uncertainty, such as the severity and transmission rate of the virus, governmental, business and individuals' actions taken in response, the development and availability of effective treatment or vaccines, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions, as well as the matters noted above. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to adversely affect many of our suppliers\u2019 and customers' businesses and operations, including the ability of our suppliers to manufacture or obtain the products we sell or to meet delivery requirements and commitments, and our customers\u2019 demand for our products and services and the ability to pay for them, all of which could adversely affect our sales and results of operations.\nWhile we are supporting essential businesses and our branch locations have remained operational consistent with existing governmental and public health authority directives to date, there is significant uncertainty as to what steps we may need to take in response to the pandemic in the future (including in response to any new health and safety measures or restrictions), and what impact they will have on our business and operations. We have taken actions to reduce costs and cash expenditures, including reductions in administrative expenses, payroll and benefits, capital expenditures, and other costs, and further steps may become necessary in the future. Due to the uncertainty of COVID-19, we will continue to assess the situation, including the impact of governmental regulations or restrictions that might be imposed or re-imposed in response to the pandemic. If we are unable to appropriately respond to or manage the impact of these events, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the impact of COVID-19 on macroeconomic conditions has adversely affected and may continue to affect the functioning of financial and capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity and energy prices, and interest rates. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, we may continue to experience adverse impacts to our business as a result of any economic recession or depression that has or may occur. The long-term financial and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic may continue for a significant period and cannot be reliably quantified or estimated at this time due to the uncertainty of these future developments.\nAny of these events could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and stock price.\nWe are subject to various laws and regulations globally and any failure to comply could adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to a broad range of laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where we operate globally, including, among others, those relating to data privacy and protection, cyber security, import and export requirements, anti-bribery and corruption, product compliance, supplier regulations regarding the sources of supplies or products, environmental protection, health and safety requirements, intellectual property, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, labor and employment, e-commerce, advertising and marketing, anti-competition and tax. Compliance with these domestic and foreign laws, regulations and requirements may be burdensome, increasing our cost of compliance and doing business. In addition, as a supplier to federal, state, and local government agencies, we must comply with certain laws and regulations relating specifically to our governmental contracts. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws, we cannot assure you that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations, or our policies and procedures. Any such violations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, damage to our reputation, and, in the case of laws and regulations relating to governmental contracts, the loss of those contracts.\nFluctuations in foreign currency have an effect on our results from operations.\nThe results of our foreign operations are reported in the local currency and then translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. The exchange rates between some of these currencies and the U.S. dollar have fluctuated significantly in recent years, and may continue to do so in the future. We may incur losses related to foreign currency fluctuations, and foreign exchange controls may prevent us from repatriating cash in countries outside the U.S. In addition, because our financial statements are stated in U.S. dollars, such fluctuations may also affect the comparability of our results between financial periods.\nRisks Related to Our Information Systems and Technology\nAny significant disruption or failure of our information systems, could lead to interruptions in our operations, which may materially adversely affect our business operations, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe operate a number of facilities and we coordinate company activities, including information technology systems and administrative services and the like, through our headquarters operations. We rely on the proper functioning and availability of our information systems to successfully operate our business, including managing inventory, processing customer orders, shipping products and providing service to customers, and compiling financial results. Our operations depend on our ability to maintain existing systems and implement new technology, which includes allocating sufficient resources to periodically upgrade our information technology systems, and to protect our equipment and the information stored in our databases against both manmade and natural disasters, as well as power losses, computer and telecommunications failures, technological breakdowns, unauthorized intrusions, cyber-attacks, and other events. Any significant or prolonged unavailability or failure of our critical information systems could materially impair our ability to maintain proper levels of inventories, process orders, meet the demands of our customers in a timely manner, and other harmful effects.\nWe seek to continually enhance our information systems, and such changes could potentially create a disruption or failure of our existing information technology. Conversions to new information technology systems may result in cost overruns, delays or business interruptions. Additionally, efforts to align portions of our business on common platforms, systems and processes could result in unforeseen interruptions, increased costs or liability, and other negative effects. If our information technology systems are disrupted, become obsolete or do not adequately support our strategic, operational or compliance needs, it could result in a competitive disadvantage or adversely affect our business operations and financial condition, including our ability to process orders, receive and ship products, maintain inventories, collect accounts receivable and pay expenses, therefore impacting our results of operations.\nWe may experience a failure in or breach of our information security systems, or those of our third-party service providers, as a result of cyber-attacks or information security breaches.\nBecause we rely heavily on information technology both in serving our customers and in our enterprise infrastructure in order to achieve our objectives, we may be vulnerable to damage or intrusion from a variety of cyber-attacks, including computer viruses, worms or other malicious software programs that seek to gain to access our systems and networks, or those of our third-party service providers. Additionally, third parties may fraudulently attempt to induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords and other information in order to gain access to our customers\u2019 data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our information technology systems. Information technology security threats to our systems, networks and data have dramatically increased in recent years due the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our proprietary and confidential information.\nAlthough we actively manage information technology security risks within our control and continually seek to enhance our controls and processes designed to protect our systems, computers, networks and data, there can be no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to mitigate all potential risks. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. Despite the precautions we take to mitigate the risks of such events, an attack on our enterprise information technology system, or those of third parties with which we do business, could result in theft or unauthorized disclosure of our proprietary or confidential information or a breach of confidential customer, supplier or employee information. Such events could impair our ability to conduct our operations, which could have an adverse impact on revenue and harm our reputation. Additionally, such an event could expose us to regulatory sanctions or penalties, lawsuits or other legal action or cause us to incur legal liabilities and costs, which could be significant, in order to address and remediate the effects of an attack and related security concerns. The insurance coverage we maintain may be inadequate to cover claims or liabilities relating to a cybersecurity attack.\nIn addition, the legal and regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy in the U.S. and international jurisdictions is constantly evolving. Violation or non-compliance with any of these laws or regulations, contractual requirements relating to data security and privacy, or our own privacy and security policies, either intentionally or unintentionally, or through the acts of intermediaries could have a material adverse effect on our brand, reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as subject us to significant fines, litigation losses, third-party damages and other liabilities.\nRisks Related to Our Industry, Markets and Business Operations\nLoss of key suppliers could decrease sales, profit margins, and earnings.\nMost of our agreements with suppliers are terminable by either party on 60 days' notice or less for any reason. We currently source products from thousands of suppliers. However, our 10 largest suppliers in 2020 accounted for approximately 30% of our purchases by annual dollar volume for the period. The loss of, or a substantial decrease in the availability of, products from any of these suppliers, a supplier's change in sales strategy to reduce its reliance on distribution channels, the loss of key preferred supplier agreements, or disruptions in a key supplier's operations could have a material adverse effect on our business. Although we believe our relationships with our key suppliers are good, they could change their strategies as a result of a change in control, expansion of their direct sales force, changes in the marketplace or other factors beyond our control, including a key supplier becoming financially distressed. Supply interruptions could arise from shortages of raw materials, effects of economic, political or financial market conditions on a supplier's operations, labor disputes or weather conditions affecting products or shipments, transportation disruptions, natural disasters, outbreaks of disease, information system disruptions or other reasons beyond our control.\nProduct cost fluctuations, lack of product availability, or inefficient supply chain operations could decrease sales, profit margins, and earnings.\nSome of our products, such as wire and conduit, are commodity price based products and may be subject to significant price fluctuations which are beyond our control. While increases in the cost of energy or products could have adverse effects, decreases in those costs, particularly if severe, could also adversely impact us by creating deflation in selling prices, which could cause our gross profit margin to deteriorate. Fluctuations in energy or raw materials costs can also adversely affect our customers. Declines in oil and natural gas prices can negatively impact our customers operating in those industries and, consequently, our sales to those customers. Furthermore, we cannot be certain that particular products or product lines will be available to us, or available in quantities sufficient to meet customer demand. Such limited product access could cause us to be at a competitive disadvantage. The profitability of our business is also dependent upon the efficiency of our supply chain. An inefficient or ineffective supply chain strategy or operations could increase operational costs, decrease sales, profit margins and earnings, which could adversely affect our business.\nA decline in project volume could adversely affect our sales and earnings.\nWhile much of our sales and earnings are generated by comparatively smaller and more frequent orders, the fulfillment of large orders for large capital projects generates significant sales and earnings. Accordingly, our results of operations can fluctuate depending on whether and when large project awards occur and the commencement and progress of work under large contracts already awarded.\nThe awarding and timing of projects is unpredictable and depends on many factors outside of our control. Project awards often involve complex and lengthy negotiations and competitive bidding processes. These processes can be impacted by a wide range of factors including a customer\u2019s decision to not proceed with a project or its inability to obtain necessary governmental approvals or financing, commodity prices, and overall market and economic conditions. Slow macro-economic growth rates, difficult credit market conditions for our customers, weak demand for our customers\u2019 products or other customer spending constraints can result in project delays or cancellations. In addition, some our competitors may also be more willing to take greater or unusual risks or include terms and conditions in a contract that we might not deem acceptable.\nWe have risks associated with the sale of nonconforming products and services.\nHistorically, we have experienced a small number of cases in which our vendors supplied us with products that did not conform to the agreed upon specifications without our knowledge. Additionally, we may inadvertently sell a product not suitable for a customer\u2019s application. We address this risk through our quality control processes, by seeking to limit liability and our warranty in our customer contracts, by obtaining indemnification rights from vendors and by maintaining insurance responsive to these risks. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to include protective provisions in all of our contracts, that vendors will have the financial capability to fulfill their indemnification obligations to us, or that insurance can be obtained with sufficiently broad coverage or in amounts sufficient to fully protect us.\nDisruptions to our logistics capability or supply chain may have an adverse impact on our operations.\nOur global logistics services are operated through distribution centers around the world. An interruption of operations at any of our distribution centers could have a material adverse effect on the operations of branches served by the affected distribution. Such disaster related risks and effects are not predictable with certainty and, although they typically can be mitigated, they cannot be eliminated. We seek to mitigate our exposures to disaster events in a number of ways. For example, where feasible, we design the configuration of our facilities to reduce the consequences of disasters. We also maintain insurance for our facilities against casualties, and we evaluate our risks and develop contingency plans for dealing with them. Although we have reviewed and analyzed a broad range of risks applicable to our business, the ones that actually affect us may not be those that we have concluded are most likely to occur. Furthermore, although our reviews have led to more systematic contingency planning, our plans are in varying stages of development and execution, such that they may not be adequate at the time of occurrence for the magnitude of any particular disaster event that we may encounter.\nWe also depend on transportation service providers for the delivery of products to our customers. Any significant interruption or disruption in service at one or more of our distribution centers due to severe weather, natural disasters, information technology upgrades, operating issues, disruptions to our transportation network, public heath crises, pandemics or other unanticipated events, could impair our ability to obtain or deliver inventory in a timely manner, cause cancellations or delays in shipments to customers or otherwise disrupt our normal business operations.\nAn increase in competition could decrease sales, profit margins, and earnings.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and compete directly with global, national, regional and local providers of like products and services. Some of our existing competitors have, and new market entrants may have, greater resources than us. Competition is generally based on product line breadth, product availability, service capabilities and price. Other sources of competition are buying groups formed by smaller distributors to increase purchasing power and provide some cooperative marketing capability, as well as e-commerce companies. There may be new market entrants with non-traditional business and customer service models, resulting in increased competition and changing industry dynamics.\nExisting or future competitors may seek to gain or retain market share by reducing prices, and we may be required to lower our prices or may lose business, which could adversely affect our financial results. We may be subject to supplier price increases while not being able to increase prices to customers. Also, to the extent that we do not meet changing customer preferences or demands, or to the extent that one or more of our competitors becomes more successful with private label products, on-line offerings or otherwise, our ability to attract and retain customers could be materially adversely affected. Existing or future competitors also may seek to compete with us for acquisitions, which could have the effect of increasing the price and reducing the number of suitable acquisitions. These factors, in addition to competitive pressures resulting from the fragmented nature of our industry, could affect our sales, profit margins and earnings.\nRisks Related to Tax Matters\nChanges in tax laws or challenges to the Company's tax positions by taxing authorities could adversely impact the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to taxes in jurisdictions in which we do business, including but not limited to taxes imposed on our income, receipts, stockholders' equity, property, sales, purchases and payroll. As a result, the tax expense we incur can be adversely affected by changes in tax law. We frequently cannot anticipate these changes in tax law, which can cause unexpected volatility in our results of operations. Changes in the tax law at the federal and state/provincial levels, in particular in the U.S. and Canada, can have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nAdditionally, the tax laws to which the Company is subject are inherently complex and ambiguous. Therefore, we must interpret the applicable laws and make subjective judgments about the expected outcome upon challenge by the applicable taxing authorities. As a result, the impact on our results from operations of the application of enacted tax laws to our facts and circumstances is sometimes uncertain. If a tax authority successfully challenges our interpretation and application of the tax law to our facts and circumstances, there can be no assurance that we can accurately predict the outcome and the taxes ultimately owed upon effective settlement, which may differ from the tax expense recognized in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income (loss) and accrued in our consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, if we cannot meet liquidity requirements in the U.S., we may have to repatriate funds from overseas, which would result in additional income taxes being incurred on the amount repatriated.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness and Capital Structure\nOur outstanding indebtedness requires debt service commitments that could adversely affect our ability to fulfill our obligations and could limit our growth and impose restrictions on our business.\nIn 2020, we incurred significant additional indebtedness to finance the acquisition of Anixter, which increased our interest expense from historical levels. As a result, a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available to us for other purposes. As of December 31, 2020, excluding debt discount and debt issuance costs, we had $5.0 billion of consolidated indebtedness. We and our subsidiaries may also undertake additional borrowings in the future, subject to certain limitations contained in the debt instruments governing our indebtedness.\nOver the next three years, we will be required to repay or refinance approximately $1.6 billion of our currently outstanding indebtedness.\nOur debt service obligations impact our ability to operate and grow our business. Our payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness reduce the amount of funds available to us to invest in operations, future business opportunities, acquisitions, and other potentially beneficial activities. Our debt service obligations also reduce our flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions and may increase our vulnerability to adverse economic, financial market and industry conditions. Our ability to service and refinance our indebtedness, make scheduled payments on our operating leases and fund capital expenditures, acquisitions or other business opportunities, will depend in large part on both our future performance and the availability of additional financing in the future, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you that it will be able to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nThere can be no assurance that our business will continue to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future to service our debt, make necessary capital expenditures, or meet other cash needs. If we do not achieve the expected benefits and cost savings from the merger with Anixter, or if the financial performance of the combined company does not meet current expectations, then our ability to service or repay our indebtedness may be adversely impacted. If unable to do so, we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt, sell assets, or obtain additional financing. We cannot make assurances that we will be able to refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we are unable to repay indebtedness, lenders having secured obligations could proceed against the collateral securing these obligations.\nOur debt agreements contain restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to operate our business.\nOur credit facilities and our other debt agreements, including those governing the debt financings incurred in connection with the recent merger, contain various covenants that restrict or limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness or create liens on assets\n\u2022engage in mergers, acquisitions or consolidations,\n\u2022make loans or other investments,\n\u2022transfer, lease or dispose of assets outside the ordinary course of business,\n\u2022pay dividends, repurchase equity interests, make other payments with respect to equity interests, repay or repurchase subordinated debt, and\n\u2022engage in affiliate transactions.\nIn addition, certain of these debt agreements contain financial covenant that may require us to maintain certain financial ratios and other requirements in certain circumstances. As a result of these covenants, our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and to obtain additional financing, if needed, may be significantly restricted, and we may be prevented from engaging in transactions or taking advantage of new business opportunities that might otherwise be beneficial to us. Our ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions may be affected by economic, financial and industry conditions or regulatory changes beyond our control. Failure to comply with these covenants or restrictions could result in an event of default, under our revolving lines of credit or the indentures governing certain of our outstanding notes which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate our repayment obligations. See the liquidity section in \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis\" for further details.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe are subject to costs and risks associated with global laws and regulations affecting our business, as well as litigation for product liability or other matters affecting our business.\nThe global legal and regulatory environment is complex and exposes us to compliance costs and risks, as well as litigation and other legal proceedings, which could materially affect our operations and financial results. These laws and regulations may change, sometimes significantly, as a result of political or economic events, and some changes are anticipated to occur in the coming year. They include tax laws and regulations, import and export laws and regulations, labor and employment laws and regulations, product safety, occupational safety and health laws and regulations, securities and exchange laws and regulations, data privacy laws and regulations (and other laws applicable to publicly-traded companies such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act), and environmental laws and regulations. Furthermore, as a government contractor selling to federal, state and local government entities, we are also subject to a wide variety of additional laws and regulations. Proposed laws and regulations in these and other areas could affect the cost of our business operations.\nFrom time to time we are involved in legal proceedings, audits or investigations which may relate to, for example, product liability, labor and employment (including wage and hour), tax, escheat, import and export compliance, government contracts, worker health and safety, and general commercial and securities matters. While we believe the outcome of any pending matter is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or liquidity, additional legal proceedings may arise in the future and the outcome of these as well as other contingencies could require us to take actions, which could adversely affect our operations or could require us to pay substantial amounts of money.\nWe must attract, retain and motivate key employees, and the failure to do so may adversely affect our business.\nOur success depends on hiring, retaining and motivating key employees, including executive, managerial, sales, technical, marketing and support personnel. We may have difficulty locating and hiring qualified personnel. In addition, we may have difficulty retaining such personnel once hired, and key people may leave and compete against us. The loss of key personnel or our failure to attract and retain other qualified and experienced personnel could disrupt or adversely affect our business, its sales and operating results. In addition, our operating results could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover, which may also result in loss of significant customer business, or increased employee benefit costs.\nThere is a risk that the market value of our common stock may decline.\nStock markets have experienced significant price and trading volume fluctuations, and the market prices of companies in our industry have been volatile. For some issuers, the markets have exerted downward pressure on stock prices and credit capacity. It is impossible to predict whether the price of our common stock will rise or fall. Trading prices of our common stock will be influenced by our operating results and prospects and by economic, political, financial, and other factors.", "PERMNO": 86876, "SIC": 5063, "TIC": "WCC"}
