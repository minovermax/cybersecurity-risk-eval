RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors together with all of the other information included in this Annual Report and our other reports filed with the SEC before investing in our securities. The occurrence of one or more of these risks could materially and adversely affect our business, our financial condition, and the results of our operations, which in turn could negatively impact the value of our securities.\nRisks Related to Commodity Prices\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental actions have and may continue to lead to an imbalance in expected supply and demand of oil and natural gas, which could negatively impact commodity prices and therefore our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and various governmental actions taken to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 resulted in an unprecedented decline in demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs starting in 2020. The impact was exacerbated by Saudi Arabia significantly reducing export prices and increasing oil production in March 2020. As a result, there was a significant decline in commodity prices starting at the end of the first quarter of 2020. These commodity prices remained depressed for the remainder of 2020 as compared to average commodity prices over the last few years.\nIn late 2020 and early 2021, commitments made by the OPEC and other oil producing countries to reduce their crude oil production, taken together with U.S. producers substantially reducing drilling and producing activities, resulted in higher commodity prices, but commodity prices remain volatile. The remaining uncertainty around COVID-19, the efficacy of and timeframe for vaccinations, the emergence and spread of new strains of the virus, renewed actions by governments to combat the spread of the virus, including stay-at-home mandates and recommendations and general restrictions on travel, and other lingering risks and concerns relating to COVID-19, combined together, continue to impact actual and expected demand for oil and natural gas. To the extent oil producers fail to implement or sustain production cuts or take other actions that are sufficient to balance oil, natural gas and NGLs supply with expected demand, the excess supply could lead to a resurgence of commodity price declines. As the vast majority of our revenue and cash flow is generated from the sale of oil, natural gas and NGLs, lower commodity prices resulting from COVID-19 factors could materially and adversely affect our future business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCommodity prices are volatile, and a sustained period of low commodity prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe prices we receive for our oil, natural gas and NGLs heavily influence our revenue, cash flows, profitability, access to capital, future rate of growth and carrying value of our properties. Oil, natural gas and NGLs are commodities, and their prices may fluctuate widely in response to relatively minor changes in the actual and expected supply of and demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs and market uncertainty. In addition to the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental actions, discussed above, oil, natural gas and NGL prices have historically been volatile and subject to fluctuations relating to a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022worldwide and regional economic conditions impacting the global supply of and demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs;\n\u2022the price and quantity of foreign imports of oil, natural gas and NGLs;\n\u2022political and economic conditions in or affecting other producing regions or countries, including the Middle East, Africa, South America and Russia;\n\u2022actions of OPEC, its members and other state-controlled oil companies relating to oil price and production controls;\n\u2022political, economic and other conditions that affect perceived demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs, including trade tensions between the U.S. and other countries and global health pandemics, epidemics and concerns;\n\u2022the level of global exploration, development, production, and inventories;\n\u2022prevailing prices on local price indexes in the area in which we operate;\n\u2022the proximity, capacity, cost and availability of gathering and transportation facilities;\n\u2022the availability of refining and storage capacity;\n\u2022the cost of exploring for, developing, producing and transporting reserves;\n\u2022weather conditions and other natural disasters;\n\u2022terrorist attacks targeting oil and natural gas related facilities and infrastructure;\n\u2022technological advances affecting fuel economy, energy supply and energy consumption;\n\u2022the effect of energy conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements and the price and availability of alternative fuels;\n\u2022laws, regulations and taxes in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions that impact the demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs;\n\u2022shareholder activism or activities by non-governmental organizations to restrict the exploration and production of oil and natural gas so as to minimize emissions of carbon dioxide and methane GHGs or otherwise;\n\u2022localized and global supply and demand fundamentals; and\n\u2022expectations about future commodity prices.\nThese factors and the volatility of the energy markets make it extremely difficult to predict future oil, natural gas and NGL price movements with any certainty. From 2016 through 2020, the WTI spot price for oil averaged $51.21 per Bbl, which is down substantially from the $85.82 average for the prior five-year period. The Henry Hub average spot price from 2016 through 2020 of $2.65 per MMBtu similarly declined from $3.49 per MMBtu, which was the average for the prior five-year period. The commodity prices displayed even more dramatic volatility in 2020, during which the WTI spot price for oil briefly fell to a low of negative $37.63 per barrel on April 20, 2020 and the Henry Hub spot price reached a low of $1.33 on September 21, 2020. During these periods, NGLs, which are made up of ethane, propane, isobutene, normal butane and natural gasoline, all of which have different uses and different pricing characteristics, have suffered significant recent price declines.\nA sustained or further extended decline in commodity prices may result in a shortfall in our expected revenues and cash flows and require us to reduce capital spending or borrow funds to cover any such shortfall. If we are unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, our ability to develop future reserves could be adversely affected. Also, using lower prices in estimating proved reserves may result in a reduction in proved reserve volumes due to economic limits. In addition, sustained periods of low commodity prices for oil and natural gas and the resultant effect such prices may have on our drilling economics and our ability to raise capital may require us to re-evaluate and postpone, moderate or eliminate our planned drilling and completions operations, or suspend production from current wells, which could result in the reduction of our expected production and some of our proved undeveloped reserves and related standardized measure. If we moderate or curtail our drilling, completion or production operations, we may be unable to continue to hold leases that are scheduled to expire, which may further reduce our reserves. As a result, a sustained or further extended decline in commodity prices may materially and adversely affect our future business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to finance planned capital expenditures.\nIf commodity prices decrease to a level such that our future undiscounted cash flows from our properties are less than their carrying value, we may be required to take write-downs of the carrying values of our properties.\nAccounting guidance requires that we periodically review the carrying value of our properties for possible impairment. Based on prevailing commodity prices and specific market factors and circumstances at the time of prospective impairment reviews, and the continuing evaluation of development plans, production data, economics and other factors, we may be required to write-down the carrying value of our properties. A write-down constitutes a non-cash charge to earnings. In 2020, we recognized an impairment of $591.8 million because of the depressed oil and natural gas commodity prices at the time we conducted the impairment analysis in the first quarter. While commodity prices improved in the subsequent quarters of 2020 and we did not recognize any further impairments directly relating to prevailing commodity prices, a sustained or further extended decline in commodity prices in the future could result in additional impairments of our properties, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the periods in which such charges are taken.\nRisks Related to Our Reserves, Leases and Drilling Locations\nReserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\nThe process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex. In order to prepare reserve estimates, we must project production rates and timing of development expenditures. We must also analyze available geological, geophysical, seismic, production and engineering data. The extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary. The process also requires economic assumptions about matters such as commodity prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. Any significant inaccuracies in our interpretations of this technical data or in making our assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves.\nActual future production, commodity prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves may vary from our estimates. For instance, initial production rates reported by us or other operators may not be indicative of future or long-term production rates, our recovery efficiencies may be worse than expected, and production declines may be greater than our estimates and may be more rapid and irregular when compared to initial production rates. In addition, we may adjust reserve estimates to reflect additional production history, results of development activities, current commodity prices and other existing factors. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves.\nYou should not assume that the present value of future net revenues from our reserves is the current market value of our estimated reserves. We generally base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from reserves on prices and costs on the date\nof the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the present value estimate. Our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2020, and related standardized measure were calculated under rules of the SEC using twelve-month trailing average benchmark prices of $36.04 per barrel of oil (WTI Posted) and $1.99 per MMBtu (Henry Hub spot), which may be substantially higher or lower than the available spot prices in 2021. For example, if the crude oil and natural gas prices used in our year-end reserve estimates were to increase or decrease by 10%, our proved reserve quantities at December 31, 2020 would increase by 4.5 MMBoe (2%) or decrease by 24.3 MMBoe (8%), respectively, and the pre-tax PV10% of our proved reserves would increase by $334.5 million (28%) or decrease by $327.7 million (28%), respectively.\nOur use of seismic data is subject to interpretation and may not accurately identify the presence of oil and natural gas, which could adversely affect the results of our drilling operations.\nEven when properly used and interpreted, seismic data and visualization techniques are only tools used to assist geoscientists in identifying subsurface structures and hydrocarbon indicators and do not enable the interpreter to know whether hydrocarbons are, in fact, present in those structures. As a result, our drilling activities may not be successful or economical. In addition, the use of advanced technologies, such as 3-D seismic data, requires greater pre-drilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies, and we could incur losses as a result of such expenditures.\nUnless we replace our reserves with new reserves and develop those reserves, our reserves and production will decline, which would adversely affect our future cash flows and results of operations.\nProducing oil and natural gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Unless we conduct successful ongoing exploration and development activities or continually acquire properties containing proved reserves, our proved reserves will decline as those reserves are produced. Our future reserves and production, and therefore our future cash flows and results of operations, are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. We may not be able to develop, find or acquire sufficient additional reserves to replace our current and future production, particularly because competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, and many of our competitors possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources substantially greater than ours. If we are unable to replace our current and future production, the value of our reserves will decrease, and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nThe development of our estimated PUDs may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate. Therefore, our estimated PUDs may not be ultimately developed or produced.\nAs of December 31, 2020, 50% of our total estimated proved reserves were classified as proved undeveloped. Development of these proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate. Delays in the development of our reserves, increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves or decreases in commodity prices will reduce the value of our estimated PUDs and future net revenues estimated for such reserves and may result in some projects becoming uneconomic. In addition, delays in the development of reserves could cause us to have to reclassify our PUDs as unproved reserves. Further, we may be required to write-down our PUDs if we do not drill those wells within five years after their respective dates of booking.\nCertain of our undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage, the primary term is extended through continuous drilling provisions or the leases are renewed.\nAs of December 31, 2020, over 88% of our total net acreage was held by production. The leases for our net acreage not held by production will expire at the end of their primary term unless production is established in paying quantities under the units containing these leases, the leases are held beyond their primary terms under continuous drilling provisions or the leases are renewed. Some of our leases also expire as to certain depths if continuous drilling obligations are not met. If our leases expire in whole or in part and we are unable to renew the leases, we will lose the right to develop the related properties. Our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties, including commodity prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, drilling results, lease expirations, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints, access to and availability of water sourcing and distribution systems, regulatory approvals and other factors.\nIn 2020, given the weakness in realized oil prices at the end of the first quarter, we voluntarily shut-in a portion of our second quarter 2020 production volumes. In the future, we may again shut-in some or all of our production depending on market conditions, storage or transportation constraints and contractual obligations, and any prolonged shut-in of our wells could result in the expiration, in whole or in part, of the related leases, which could adversely affect our reserves, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur identified drilling locations are scheduled out over many years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling.\nWe have specifically identified and scheduled certain drilling locations as an estimation of our future multi-year drilling activities on our existing acreage. These drilling locations represent a significant part of our business strategy. Our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties, including commodity prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, drilling results, lease expirations, availability of gathering or transportation facilities, access to and availability of water sourcing and distribution systems, regulatory approvals, including permitting, and other factors. Because of these uncertain factors, we do not know if the numerous identified drilling locations will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce natural gas or oil from these or any other drilling locations. In addition, unless production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres on which some of the drilling locations are obtained, the leases for such acreage will expire. As such, our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified.\nProperties that we decide to drill may not yield oil or natural gas in commercially viable quantities.\nProperties that we decide to drill that do not yield oil or natural gas in commercially viable quantities will adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. There is no way to predict in advance of drilling and testing whether any particular prospect will yield oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to recover drilling or completion costs or be economically viable. The use of micro-seismic data and other technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area will not enable us to know conclusively prior to drilling whether oil or natural gas will be present or, if present, whether oil or natural gas will be present in commercial quantities. We cannot assure you that the analogies we draw from available data from other wells, more fully explored prospects or producing fields will be applicable to our drilling prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nOur development and acquisition projects require substantial capital expenditures. We may be unable to obtain required capital or financing on satisfactory terms, which could lead to a decline in our ability to access or grow production and reserves.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is capital-intensive. We make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures related to development and acquisition projects. Historically, we have funded our capital expenditures with cash flows from operations, borrowings under CRP\u2019s revolving credit facility, proceeds from offering debt and equity securities and divestitures of non-core assets, and we intend to finance our future capital expenditures in a similar fashion. When we finance our capital expenditures through indebtedness a portion of our cash flows from operations must be used to pay interest and principal on the indebtedness, which reduces our ability to use cash flows from operations to fund working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions. The actual amount and timing of our future capital expenditures may differ materially from our estimates as a result of, among other things, oil, natural gas and NGL prices; actual drilling results; the availability of drilling rigs and other services and equipment; and regulatory, technological and competitive developments.\nOur cash flow from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables, including:\n\u2022the prices at which our production is sold;\n\u2022our proved reserves;\n\u2022the level of hydrocarbons we are able to produce from existing wells;\n\u2022our ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves;\n\u2022the levels of our operating expenses; and\n\u2022our ability to borrow under CRP\u2019s revolving credit facility and to access the capital markets.\nIf our revenues or the borrowing base under CRP\u2019s revolving credit facility decrease as a result of lower oil, natural gas and NGL prices, operating difficulties, declines in reserves or for any other reason, we may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations at current levels. If additional capital is needed, we may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If cash flow generated by our operations or available borrowings under CRP\u2019s revolving credit facility are not sufficient to meet our capital requirements, the failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of our operations relating to development of our properties. This, in turn, could lead to a decline in our reserves and production, and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDrilling for and producing oil and natural gas are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, we may not be insured for, or our insurance may be inadequate to protect us against, these risks.\nOur future financial condition and results of operations will depend on the success of our development, acquisition and production activities, which are subject to numerous risks beyond our control, including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially\nviable oil and natural gas production. In addition to the risks we face in drilling for and producing oil and natural gas, some factors that may directly or indirectly negatively impact our scheduled operations:\n\u2022lack of available gathering or transportation facilities or delays in the constructing such facilities;\n\u2022abnormal pressure or irregularities in geological formations;\n\u2022shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment, qualified personnel, materials or resources;\n\u2022equipment failures, accidents or other unexpected operational events;\n\u2022delays imposed by or resulting from compliance with laws and regulations, including limitations resulting from wastewater disposal, emission of GHGs and limitations on hydraulic fracturing;\n\u2022environmental hazards, such as oil and natural gas leaks, oil spills, pipeline and tank ruptures and unauthorized discharges of brine, well stimulation and completion fluids, toxic gases or other pollutants into the surface and subsurface environment;\n\u2022natural disasters;\n\u2022personal injuries and death;\n\u2022terrorist attacks targeting oil and natural gas related facilities and infrastructure;\n\u2022limited availability of financing at acceptable terms;\n\u2022title problems;\n\u2022adverse weather conditions; and\n\u2022limitations in the market for oil and natural gas.\nWe are not insured against all risks. Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured and underinsured events, including those operating risks listed above, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. We may elect not to obtain insurance for any or all of these risks if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. The occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMany of our properties are in areas that may have been partially depleted or drained by offset wells and certain of our wells may be adversely affected by actions other operators may take when drilling, completing, or operating wells that they own.\nMany of our properties are in areas that may have already been partially depleted or drained by earlier offset drilling. The owners of leasehold interests adjoining any of our properties could take actions, such as drilling and completing additional wells, which could adversely affect our operations. When a new well is completed and produced, the pressure differential in the vicinity of the well causes the migration of reservoir fluids toward the new wellbore (and potentially away from existing wellbores). As a result, the drilling and production of these potential locations could cause a depletion of our proved reserves and may inhibit our ability to further develop our proved reserves. In addition, completion operations and other activities conducted on adjacent or nearby wells could cause production from our wells to be shut in for indefinite periods of time, could result in increased lease operating expenses and could adversely affect the production and reserves from our wells after they re-commence production. We have no control over the operations or activities of offsetting operators.\nPart of our strategy involves using some of the latest available horizontal drilling and completion techniques, which involve risks and uncertainties in their application.\nOur operations involve utilizing some of the latest drilling and completion techniques as developed by us and our service providers. Risks that we face while drilling horizontal wells include the following:\n\u2022landing a wellbore in the desired drilling zone;\n\u2022staying in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation;\n\u2022spacing the wells appropriately to maximize production rates and recoverable reserves;\n\u2022running our casing the entire length of the wellbore; and\n\u2022being able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal wellbore.\nRisks that we face while completing wells include the following:\n\u2022the ability to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages;\n\u2022the ability to run tools the entire length of the wellbore during completion operations;\n\u2022the ability to successfully clean out the wellbore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage; and\n\u2022the ability to prevent unintentional communication with other wells.\nIn addition, the results of our drilling in new or emerging formations are more uncertain initially than drilling results in areas that are more developed and have a longer history of established production. Newer or emerging formations and areas have limited or no production history and, consequently, we are more limited in assessing future drilling results in these areas. If our drilling results are less than anticipated, the return on our investment for a particular project may not be as attractive as anticipated, and we could incur material write-downs of unevaluated properties and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future.\nOur operations are substantially dependent on the availability of water. Restrictions on our ability to obtain water may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWater is an essential component of deep shale oil and natural gas production during both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. Drought conditions have persisted in Texas in past years. These drought conditions have led some local water districts to restrict the use of water subject to their jurisdiction for hydraulic fracturing to protect local water supplies. Where practicable, we strive to use recycled water for our hydraulic fracturing operations. If we are unable to obtain water from water suppliers or our recycling operations, it may need to be obtained from non-local sources and transported to drilling sites, resulting in increased costs, or we may be unable to economically drill for or produce oil and natural gas, each of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur ability to produce crude oil, natural gas and NGLs economically and in commercial quantities could be impaired if we are unable to acquire adequate supplies of water for our drilling operations or are unable to recycle or dispose of the produced water we produce in an economical and environmentally safe manner.\nOur operations could be impaired if we are unable to recycle or dispose of the water we produce in an economical and environmentally safe manner. Where practicable, we strive to recycle the produced water for our future oil and gas operations. Produced water that is not recycled generally gets disposed of in disposal wells that are operated by us or third-party contractors. Some studies have linked earthquakes or induced seismicity in certain areas to underground injection of produced water resulting from oil and gas activities, which has led to increased public and governmental scrutiny of injection safety. For instance, in response to concerns regarding induced seismicity, regulators in Texas have adopted new rules governing the permitting or re-permitting of wells used to dispose of produced water and other fluids resulting from the production of oil and gas. Among other things, these rules require companies seeking permits for disposal wells to provide seismic activity data in permit applications, provide for more frequent monitoring and reporting for certain wells and allow the state to modify, suspend or terminate permits on grounds that a disposal well is likely to be, or determined to be, causing seismic activity.\nAnother consequence of water disposal activities and seismic events may be lawsuits alleging that disposal well operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules regulating waste disposal. These developments could result in additional regulation and restrictions on our use of injection wells or commercial disposal wells to dispose of produced water. Increased regulation and attention given to water disposal and induced seismicity could also lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to limit or prohibit oil and gas activities utilizing injection wells for produced water disposal. Any one or more of these developments may result in limitations on disposal well volumes, disposal rates and pressures or locations, require us or our vendors to shut down or curtail the injection into disposal wells, or cause delays, interruptions or termination of our operations, which events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur producing properties are concentrated in the Delaware Basin, a sub-basin of the Permian Basin, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in a single geographic area.\nOur producing properties are geographically concentrated in the Delaware Basin, a sub-basin of the Permian Basin, primarily in West Texas and New Mexico. At December 31, 2020, all of our total estimated proved reserves were attributable to properties located in this area. As a result of this concentration, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors, delays or interruptions of production from wells in this area caused by governmental regulation, processing or transportation capacity constraints, market limitations, availability of equipment and personnel, water shortages, regional power outages or other drought or extreme weather related conditions or interruption of the processing or transportation of oil, natural gas or NGLs. In addition, the effect of fluctuations on supply and demand may become more pronounced within specific geographic oil and natural gas producing areas such as the Permian Basin, which may cause these conditions to occur with greater frequency or magnify the effects of these conditions. Due to the concentrated nature of our portfolio of properties, a number of our properties could experience any of the same conditions at the same time, resulting in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other companies that have a more diversified portfolio of properties. Such delays or interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe marketability of our production is dependent upon transportation and other facilities, most of which we do not control. If these facilities are unavailable, or if we are unable to access these facilities on commercially reasonable terms, our operations could be interrupted and our revenues reduced.\nThe marketability of our oil, natural gas and NGLs production depends in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of transportation facilities owned by third parties. Our oil, natural gas and NGLs production is generally transported from the wellhead by gathering systems that are either owned by us or third-party midstream companies. In general, we do not control the transportation of our production and our access to transportation facilities may be limited or denied. In some instances, we have contractual guarantees relating to the transportation of our production through firm transportation arrangements, but third-party systems may be temporarily unavailable due to market conditions, mechanical failures, accidents or other reasons. Insufficient production from our wells to support the construction of pipeline facilities by our purchasers or third-party midstream companies or a significant disruption in the availability of our or third-party transportation facilities or other production facilities could adversely impact our ability to deliver to market or produce our oil, natural gas and NGLs and thereby cause a significant interruption in our operations. If, in the future, we are unable, for any sustained period, to implement acceptable delivery or transportation arrangements, we may be required to shut in or curtail production or flare our natural gas. If we were required to shut-in wells, we might also be obligated to pay certain demand charges for gathering and processing services and firm transportation charges for pipeline capacity we have reserved. Any such shut-in or curtailment, or an inability to obtain favorable terms for delivery of the oil, natural gas and NGLs produced from our fields, would materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have entered into multi-year agreements with some of our suppliers, service providers and the purchasers of our oil and natural gas, which contain minimum volume commitments. Any failure by us to satisfy the minimum volume commitments could lead to contractual penalties that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nWe have entered into certain multi-year supply and service agreements associated with water disposal. We also have various multi-year agreements that relate to the sale, transportation or gathering of our oil and natural gas and may in the future enter into multi-year agreements for contracts for drilling rigs or other services. Some of these agreements contain minimum volume commitments that we must satisfy or contractual penalties in the form of volume deficiencies or other remedies may apply. As of December 31, 2020, our aggregate long-term contractual obligation under these agreements was $12.8 million, which represents the gross minimum obligation but does not include amounts that may be due under certain contracts that contain variable pricing or volumetric components as the future obligations cannot be determined. Further information about these agreements can be found at Note 13-Commitments and Contingencies, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this Annual Report. Any failure by us to satisfy the minimum volume commitments in these agreements could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nWe depend upon a small number of significant purchasers for the sale of most of our oil, natural gas and NGL production.\nWe normally sell production to a relatively small number of customers, as is customary in our business. See Note 1-Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this Annual Report for significant purchasers that accounted for more than 10% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. The loss of any of our major purchasers could materially and adversely affect our revenues in the near-term.\nWe may incur losses as a result of title defects in the properties in which we invest.\nThe existence of a material title deficiency can render a lease worthless and can adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. While we typically obtain title opinions prior to commencing drilling operations on a lease or in a unit, the failure of title may not be discovered until after a well is drilled, in which case we may lose the lease and the right to produce all or a portion of the minerals under the property.\nMulti-well pad drilling may result in volatility in our operating results.\nWe utilize multi-well pad drilling where practical. Because wells drilled on a pad are not brought into production until all wells on the pad are drilled and completed and the drilling rig is moved from the location, multi-well pad drilling delays the commencement of production from a given pad, which may cause volatility in our operating results. In addition, problems affecting one pad could adversely affect production from all wells on such pad. As a result, multi-well pad drilling can cause delays in the scheduled commencement of production or interruptions in ongoing production.\nWe may be unable to make attractive acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired businesses, and any inability to do so may disrupt our business and hinder our ability to grow.\nIn the future we may make acquisitions of assets or businesses that complement or expand our current business. The successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors, including:\n\u2022recoverable reserves;\n\u2022future commodity prices and their applicable differentials;\n\u2022operating costs; and\n\u2022potential environmental and other liabilities.\nThe accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain. In connection with these assessments, we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems, nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems, such as groundwater contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems. We often are not entitled to contractual indemnification for environmental liabilities and acquire properties on an \u201cas is\u201d basis.\nThe success of any completed acquisition will depend on our ability to integrate effectively the acquired business into our existing operations. The process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our managerial and financial resources. In addition, possible future acquisitions may be larger and purchase prices higher than those paid for earlier acquisitions. No assurance can be given that we will be able to identify additional suitable acquisition opportunities, negotiate acceptable terms, obtain financing for acquisitions on acceptable terms or successfully acquire identified targets. Our failure to achieve consolidation savings, to integrate the acquired businesses and assets into our existing operations successfully or to minimize any unforeseen operational difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, debt agreements impose certain limitations on our ability to enter into mergers or combination transactions and our ability to incur certain indebtedness, which could indirectly limit our ability to engage in acquisitions of businesses.\nThe unavailability or high cost of additional drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel and oilfield services could adversely affect our ability to execute our development plans within our budget and on a timely basis.\nThe demand for drilling rigs, pipe and other equipment and supplies, as well as for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct field operations, geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry, can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with commodity prices, causing periodic shortages. In addition, to the extent our suppliers source their products or raw materials from foreign markets, the cost of such equipment could be impacted if the United States imposes tariffs on imported goods from countries where these goods are produced. We cannot predict whether these conditions will exist in the future and, if so, what their timing and duration will be. Such shortages or cost increases could delay or cause us to incur significant expenditures that are not provided for in our capital budget, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe could experience periods of higher costs if commodity prices rise. These increases could reduce our profitability, cash flow and ability to complete development activities as planned.\nHistorically, our capital and operating costs have risen during periods of increasing oil, natural gas and NGL prices. These cost increases result from a variety of factors beyond our control, such as increases in the cost of electricity, steel and other raw materials that we and our vendors rely upon; increased demand for labor, services and materials as drilling activity increases; and increased taxes. Such costs may rise faster than increases in our revenue as commodity prices rise, thereby negatively impacting our profitability, cash flows and ability to complete development activities as scheduled and on budget. This impact may be magnified to the extent that our ability to participate in the commodity price increases is limited by our derivative activities.\nA security interruption or failure with respect to our information technology systems could harm our ability to effectively operate our business.\nOur ability to effectively manage and operate our business depends significantly on information technology systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively and support our operations, challenges in transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, difficulty in integrating new or updated systems, or a breach in security of these systems could adversely impact the operations of our business.\nAny breach of our network may result in the loss of valuable business data, misappropriation of our customers\u2019 or employees\u2019 personal information, or a disruption of our business, which could harm our customer relationships and reputation, and result in lost revenues, fines or lawsuits.\nMoreover, we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data. Any failure to comply with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal and reputational risks. Misuse of or failure to secure personal information could also result in violation of data privacy laws and regulations, proceedings against us by governmental entities or others, damage to our reputation and credibility, and could have a negative impact on revenues and profits.\nRisks Related to Our Derivative Transactions, Debt and Access to Capital\nOur derivative activities could result in financial losses or could reduce our earnings.\nWe enter into derivative instrument contracts for a portion of our oil and natural gas production from time to time. As of December 31, 2020, we had entered into derivative contracts covering a portion of our projected oil and gas production through early 2022 (refer to Note 7-Derivative Instruments under Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for a summary of our derivative instruments as of December 31, 2020). Accordingly, our earnings may fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in fair value of our derivative instruments.\nDerivative instruments also expose us to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when:\n\u2022production is less than the volume covered by the derivative instruments;\n\u2022there is an increase in the differential between the underlying price in the derivative instrument and actual prices received; or\n\u2022there are issues with regard to legal enforceability of such instruments.\nThe use of derivatives may, in some cases, require the posting of cash collateral with counterparties. If we enter into derivative instruments that require cash collateral and commodity prices or interest rates change in a manner adverse to us, our cash otherwise available for use in our operations would be reduced, which could limit our ability to make future capital expenditures and make payments on our indebtedness, and which could also limit the size of CRP\u2019s borrowing base. Future collateral requirements will depend on arrangements with our counterparties, highly volatile commodity prices and interest rates. In addition, derivative arrangements could limit the benefit we would receive from increases in the prices for oil and natural gas, which could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nOur commodity derivative contracts expose us to risk of financial loss if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract. Disruptions in the financial markets could lead to sudden decreases in a counterparty\u2019s liquidity, which could make the counterparty unable to perform under the terms of the contract, and we may not be able to realize the benefit of the contract. We are unable to predict sudden changes in a counterparty\u2019s creditworthiness or ability to perform. Even if we accurately predict sudden changes, our ability to negate the risk may be limited depending upon market conditions.\nSince our production is not fully hedged, and we are also exposed to fluctuations in oil, natural gas and NGL prices as it relates to the price we receive from the sale of our unhedged volumes. We intend to continue to hedge a portion of our production, but we may not be able to do so at favorable prices. Accordingly, our revenues and cash flows are subject to increased volatility with regard to these unhedged volumes, and a decline in commodity prices could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, business prospects and our ability to make payments on our outstanding debt.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $1.1 billion of total long-term debt and additional borrowing capacity of $333.9 million under CRP\u2019s revolving credit facility (after giving effect to a $31.8 million availability blocker and $4.3 million of outstanding letters of credit ), all of which would be secured if borrowed. Subject to the restrictions in the instruments governing CRP\u2019s outstanding indebtedness (including CRP\u2019s revolving credit facility and senior notes), CRP and its subsidiaries may incur substantial additional indebtedness (including secured indebtedness) in the future. Although the instruments governing CRP\u2019s outstanding indebtedness do contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions will be subject to waiver and a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial.\nOur current and future level of indebtedness could affect our operations in several ways, including the following:\n\u2022require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our existing debt, thereby reducing the cash available to finance our operations and other business activities;\n\u2022limit management\u2019s discretion in operating our business and our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to downturns and adverse developments in our business and the economy generally;\n\u2022limit our ability to access the capital markets to raise capital on favorable terms or to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other expenses or to refinance existing indebtedness;\n\u2022place restrictions on our ability to obtain additional financing, make investments, lease equipment, sell assets and engage in business combinations;\n\u2022make it more likely that a reduction in CRP\u2019s borrowing base following a periodic redetermination could require CRP to repay a portion of its then-outstanding bank borrowings;\n\u2022make us vulnerable to increases in interest rates as the indebtedness under CRP\u2019s revolving credit facility may vary with prevailing interest rates;\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors with lower levels of indebtedness in relation to their overall size or less restrictive terms governing their indebtedness; and\n\u2022make it more difficult for CRP to satisfy its obligations under its debt and increase the risk that we may default on its debt obligations.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of CRP\u2019s indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy CRP\u2019s obligations under applicable debt instruments, which may not be successful.\nCRP\u2019s ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance its indebtedness depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit CRP to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on CRP\u2019s indebtedness.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance indebtedness. Our ability to restructure or refinance CRP\u2019s indebtedness will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require CRP to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm CRP\u2019s ability to incur additional indebtedness. In the absence of sufficient cash flows and capital resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet debt service and other obligations. The agreements governing CRP\u2019s indebtedness restrict CRP\u2019s ability to dispose of assets and CRP\u2019s use of the proceeds from such disposition. CRP may not be able to consummate those dispositions, and the proceeds of any such disposition may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit CRP to meet scheduled debt service obligations.\nRestrictions in CRP\u2019s existing and future debt agreements could limit our growth and ability to engage in certain activities.\nCRP\u2019s credit agreement and the indentures governing its senior notes contain a number of significant covenants, including restrictive covenants that may limit CRP\u2019s ability to, among other things:\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022make loans to others;\n\u2022make investments;\n\u2022merge or consolidate with another entity;\n\u2022make certain payments;\n\u2022hedge future production or interest rates;\n\u2022incur liens;\n\u2022sell assets; and\n\u2022engage in certain other transactions without the prior consent of the lenders.\nIn addition, CRP\u2019s credit agreement requires us to maintain certain financial ratios or to reduce our indebtedness if we are unable to comply with such ratios. As of December 31, 2020, we were in full compliance with such financial ratios and covenants.\nThe restrictions in CRP\u2019s debt agreements may also limit our ability to obtain future financings to withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general, or to otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities. We may also be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations that the restrictive imposed on CRP.\nIf CRP is unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants in the agreements governing its indebtedness, there could be a default under the terms of these agreements, which could result in an acceleration of payment of funds that CRP has borrowed.\nAny default under the agreements governing CRP\u2019s indebtedness that is not cured or waived by the required lenders, and the remedies sought by the holders of any such indebtedness, could make CRP unable to pay principal, premium, if any, and interest on such indebtedness. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow and are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on CRP\u2019s indebtedness, or if CRP otherwise fails to comply with the various covenants, including financial and operating covenants, in the agreements governing CRP\u2019s indebtedness, CRP could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness. In the event of such default:\n\u2022the holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest;\n\u2022the lenders under CRP\u2019s revolving credit facility could elect to terminate their commitments thereunder, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets; and\n\u2022we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nIf our operating performance declines, we may in the future need to obtain waivers under CRP\u2019s revolving credit facility to avoid CRP being in default. If CRP breaches the covenants under its revolving credit facility and seeks a waiver, CRP may not be able to obtain a waiver from the required lenders. If this occurs, CRP would be in default under the revolving credit facility, the lenders could exercise their rights, as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nAny significant reduction in the borrowing base under CRP\u2019s revolving credit facility as a result of the periodic borrowing base redeterminations or otherwise may negatively impact our ability to fund our operations.\nCRP\u2019s revolving credit facility limits the amounts CRP can borrow up to a borrowing base amount, which the lenders, in their sole discretion, determine semiannually in the spring and fall. The borrowing base depends on, among other things, projected revenues from, and asset values of, the oil and natural gas properties securing the loan. The borrowing base will automatically be decreased by an amount equal to 25% of the aggregate notional amount of permitted senior unsecured notes CRP may issue in the future. In addition, CRP\u2019s credit agreement contains a minimum availability condition to borrowing equal to 25% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes outstanding, which we refer to in this Annual Report as an availability blocker. The lenders can unilaterally adjust the borrowing base and the borrowings permitted to be outstanding under CRP\u2019s revolving credit facility. Any increase in the borrowing base requires the consent of the lenders holding 100% of the commitments. In connection with the fall 2020 semi-annual borrowing base redetermination, the borrowing base and elected commitments were reaffirmed at $700.0 million.\nIn the future, we may not be able to access adequate funding under CRP\u2019s revolving credit facility (or a replacement facility) as a result of a decrease in the borrowing base due to the issuance of new indebtedness, the outcome of a subsequent borrowing base redetermination or an unwillingness or inability on the part of lending counterparties to meet their funding obligations and the inability of other lenders to provide additional funding to cover the defaulting lender\u2019s portion. Declines in commodity prices could result in a determination to lower the borrowing base in the future and, in such case, CRP could be required to repay any indebtedness in excess of the redetermined borrowing base. As a result, we may be unable to implement our respective drilling and development plan, make acquisitions or otherwise carry out business plans, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to service CRP\u2019s indebtedness.\nIf we experience liquidity concerns, we could face a downgrade in our debt ratings which could restrict our access to, and negatively impact the terms of, current or future financings or trade credit.\nOur ability to obtain financing and trade credit and the terms of any financing or trade credit is, in part, dependent on the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies. We cannot provide assurance that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. Factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, planned asset purchases or sales and near-term and long-term production growth opportunities, liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, product mix and commodity pricing levels. A ratings downgrade could adversely impact our ability to access financings or trade credit and increase our borrowing costs.\nIncreases in interest rates could adversely affect our business.\nOur business and operating results can be harmed by factors such as the availability, terms of and cost of capital, increases in interest rates or a reduction in credit rating. These changes could cause our cost of doing business to increase, limit our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities, reduce cash flow used for drilling and place us at a competitive disadvantage. At December 31, 2020, we had $330.0 million in borrowings outstanding under CRP\u2019s revolving credit facility. Interest is calculated under the terms of CRP\u2019s credit agreement based on a LIBOR spread. Recent and continuing disruptions and volatility in the global\nfinancial markets may lead to a contraction in credit availability impacting our ability to finance operations. We require continued access to capital. A significant reduction in cash flows from operations or the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect our ability to achieve our planned growth and operating results.\nRisks Related to Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives\nClimate change laws and regulations restricting emissions of GHGs could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce, while potential physical effects of climate change could disrupt our production and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects.\nIn response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the environment, the EPA has adopted regulations pursuant to the CAA that, among other things, require PSD preconstruction and Title V operating permits for certain large stationary sources. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their GHG emissions are also required to meet \u201cbest available control technology\u201d standards that are being established by the states or, in some cases, by the EPA on a case-by-case basis. These regulatory requirements could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified sources. In addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production sources in the United States, which include certain of our operations. Furthermore, in June 2016, the EPA finalized rules that establish new controls for emissions of methane from new, modified or reconstructed sources in the oil and natural gas source category, including production, processing, transmission and storage activities. The rule included first-time standards to address emissions of methane from equipment and processes across the source category, including hydraulically fractured oil and natural gas well completions. However, in September 2020, the EPA adopted deregulatory amendments to the 2016 standards intended to streamline implementation, reduce duplicative EPA and state requirements and decrease the burden of compliance. In particular, the amendments removed the transmission and storage segments from the oil and natural gas source category and rescinded the methane-specific requirements for production and processing facilities. Although the amendments are now in effect, they may be subject to reversal under the new presidential administration. In January 2021, the administration issued an executive order directing all federal agencies to review and take action to address any federal regulations, orders, guidance documents, policies, and similar agency actions promulgated during the prior administration that may be inconsistent with the current administration\u2019s policies. The executive order specifically called on the EPA to consider a proposed rule suspending, revising or rescinding the September 2020 deregulatory amendments by September 2021. As such, future implementation is uncertain at this time. However, compliance with these rules will require enhanced record-keeping practices, the purchase of new equipment, such as optical gas imaging instruments to detect leaks, and increased frequency of maintenance and repair activities to address emissions leakage. The rules will also likely require additional personnel time to support these activities or the engagement of third party contractors to assist with and verify compliance. These new and proposed rules could result in increased compliance costs on our operations.\nWhile Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, there has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce GHG emissions at the federal level in recent years. In the absence of such federal climate legislation, a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking and/or reducing GHG emissions by means of cap-and-trade programs. These programs typically require major sources of GHG emissions to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those GHGs. In addition, efforts have been made and continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues. The United States became one of almost 200 nations that, in December 2015, agreed to the Paris Agreement, which requires member countries to review and \u201crepresent a progression\u201d in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set GHG emission reduction goals, every five years beginning in 2020. Although the previous administration withdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement, effective November 2020, the aforementioned executive order issued by the current administration in January 2021 commenced the process for reentering the Paris Agreement. The executive order also established a Working Group, which is called on to, among other things, develop methodologies for calculating the \u201csocial cost of carbon,\u201d \u201csocial cost of nitrous oxide,\u201d and \u201csocial cost of methane.\u201d Final recommendations from the Working Group are due no later than January 2022. A separate executive order targeting climate change, also issued by the current administration in January 2021 directed the Secretary of the Interior to pause new oil and natural gas leasing on public lands and in offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review of the federal permitting and leasing practices, consider whether to adjust royalties associated with coal, oil, and gas resources extracted from public lands and offshore waters, or take other appropriate actions to account for corresponding climate costs. The climate change executive order also directed the federal government to identify \u201cfossil fuel subsidies\u201d to take steps to ensure that, to the extent consistent with applicable law, federal funding is not directly subsidizing fossil fuels. Legal challenges to the executive orders have been filed. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations. Substantial limitations on GHG emissions could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas we produce. Finally, some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as\nincreased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events; if any such effects were to occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nFederal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing as well as governmental reviews of such activities could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and natural gas wells and adversely affect our production.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of oil and/or natural gas from dense subsurface rock formations. The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, proppants and chemicals under pressure into targeted subsurface formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. We regularly use hydraulic fracturing as part of our operations. Hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions, but the EPA and other federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over aspects of the process. In addition, Congress has from time to time considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. It is unclear how any additional federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing activities may affect our operations.\nCertain governmental reviews are either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. The White House Council on Environmental Quality is coordinating an administration-wide review of hydraulic fracturing practices. Additionally, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. The EPA report concluded that hydraulic fracturing activities have not led to widespread, systemic impacts on drinking water resources in the United States, although there are above-and-below ground mechanisms by which hydraulic fracturing activities have the potential to impact drinking water resources. Other governmental agencies, including the United States Department of Energy and the United States Department of the Interior, are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing. These ongoing or proposed studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the federal SDWA or other regulatory mechanisms.\nAt the state level, several states have adopted or are considering legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. For example, in May 2013, the Railroad Commission of Texas issued a \u201cwell integrity rule,\u201d which updates the requirements for drilling, putting pipe down and cementing wells. The rule also includes new testing and reporting requirements, such as (i) the requirement to submit cementing reports after well completion or after cessation of drilling, whichever is later, and (ii) the imposition of additional testing on wells less than 1,000 feet below usable groundwater. The well integrity rule took effect in January 2014. Local governments also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. We believe that we follow applicable standard industry practices and legal requirements for groundwater protection in our hydraulic fracturing activities. Nonetheless, if new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of development activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.\nConservation measures, technological advances and negative shift in market perception toward oil and natural gas industry could reduce demand for oil and natural gas.\nFuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas, technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices could reduce demand for oil and natural gas. Additionally, the increased competitiveness of alternative energy sources (such as electric vehicles, wind, solar, geothermal, tidal, fuel cells and biofuels) could reduce demand for oil and natural gas and, therefore, our revenues.\nAdditionally, certain segments of the investor community have recently expressed negative sentiment towards investing in the oil and natural gas industry. Recent equity returns in the sector versus other industry sectors have led to lower oil and natural gas representation in certain key equity market indices. Some investors, including certain pension funds, university endowments and family foundations, have stated policies to reduce or eliminate their investments in the oil and natural gas sector based on social and environmental considerations. Furthermore, certain other stakeholders have pressured commercial and investment banks to stop funding oil and gas projects.\nThe impact of the changing demand for oil and natural gas, together with a change in investor sentiment, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations may be exposed to significant delays, costs and liabilities as a result of environmental and occupational health and safety requirements applicable to our business activities.\nOur operations are subject to stringent, complex and evolving federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment, health and safety aspects of our operations or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations applicable to our operations, including the acquisition\nof a permit or other approval before conducting regulated activities; the restriction of types, quantities and concentration of materials that can be released into the environment; the limitation or prohibition of drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; the application of specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection; and the imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations. Numerous governmental authorities, such as the EPA and analogous state agencies, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them. Such enforcement actions often involve taking difficult and costly compliance measures or corrective actions. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil or criminal penalties, natural resource damages, the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations, and the issuance of orders limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations. In addition, we may experience delays in obtaining, or be unable to obtain, required permits, which may delay or interrupt our operations and limit our growth and revenue.\nCertain environmental laws impose strict joint and several liability for costs required to remediate and restore sites where hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or solid wastes have been stored or released. We may be required to remediate contaminated properties currently or formerly operated by us or facilities of third parties that received waste generated by our operations regardless of whether such contamination resulted from the conduct of others or from consequences of our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken. In connection with certain acquisitions, we could acquire, or be required to provide indemnification against, environmental liabilities that could expose us to material losses. In addition, claims for damages to persons or property, including natural resources, may result from the environmental, health and safety impacts of our operations. Our insurance may not cover all environmental risks and costs or may not provide sufficient coverage if an environmental claim is made against us. Moreover, public interest in the protection of the environment has increased dramatically in recent years. The trend of more expansive and stringent environmental legislation and regulations applied to the crude oil and natural gas industry could continue, resulting in increased costs of doing business and consequently affecting profitability. In the states of New Mexico and Texas, as an example, governmental authorities are investigating the practice of flaring natural gas and it is possible that such states could implement additional volumetric or other restrictions on this practice which may require us to curtail or shut in production which otherwise is or would be flared due to the unavailability of acceptable delivery, transportation or processing arrangements. To the extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that restricts drilling or imposes more stringent and costly operating, waste handling, disposal and cleanup requirements, our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nRestrictions on drilling activities intended to protect certain species of wildlife may adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in areas where we operate.\nOil and natural gas operations in our operating areas may be adversely affected by seasonal or permanent restrictions on drilling activities designed to protect various wildlife. Seasonal restrictions may limit our ability to operate in protected areas and can intensify competition for drilling rigs, oilfield equipment, services, supplies and qualified personnel, which may lead to periodic shortages when drilling is allowed. These constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay our operations or materially increase our operating and capital costs. Permanent restrictions imposed to protect endangered species could prohibit drilling in certain areas or require the implementation of expensive mitigation measures. The designation of previously unprotected species in areas where we operate as threatened or endangered could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our activities that could have a material and adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce our reserves.\nChanges in laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with any laws and regulations, may adversely affect our business, investments and results of operations.\nWe are subject to laws, regulations and rules enacted by national, regional and local governments and NASDAQ. In particular, we are required to comply with certain SEC, NASDAQ and other legal or regulatory requirements. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws, regulations and rules may be difficult, time consuming and costly. Those laws, regulations and rules and their interpretation and application may also change from time to time and those changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, investments and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and rules, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock and Capital Structure\nA negative shift in investor sentiment towards the oil and gas industry could adversely affect our ability to raise equity and debt capital.\nCertain segments of the investor community have recently developed negative sentiment towards investing in the oil and gas industry. Over the past years, equity returns in the sector versus other industry sectors have led to lower oil and gas representation in certain key equity market indices. Some investors, including certain institutional investors, private equity companies, pension funds, university endowments and family foundations have stated policies to reduce or eliminate their investments in the oil and gas sector based on social and environment considerations. Certain other stakeholders have pressured commercial and investment\nbanks to stop funding oil and gas projects. Such developments could result in downward pressure on the stock prices of oil and gas companies, including ours. This may also result in a reduction of available capital funding for potential development projects, further impacting our future financial results.\nRiverstone and its affiliates own a significant percentage of our outstanding voting common stock.\nRiverstone and its affiliates beneficially own approximately 33% of our voting common stock as of December 31, 2020. As long as Riverstone and its affiliates own or control a significant percentage of outstanding voting power, they may have the ability to strongly influence all corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors and the size of our board of directors, any amendment of our third amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the \u201cCharter\u201d) or our second amended and restated bylaws (the \u201cBylaws\u201d), or the approval of any merger or other significant corporate transaction, including a sale of substantially all of our assets.\nThe interests of Riverstone and its affiliates may not align with the interests of our other stockholders. Riverstone is in the business of making investments in companies and may acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. Riverstone and its affiliates may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. In addition, our Charter provides that we renounce any interest or expectancy in the business opportunities of our officers and directors and their respective affiliates and each such party shall not have any obligation to offer us those opportunities unless presented to one of our directors or officers in his or her capacity as a director or officer.\nProvisions contained in our Charter and Bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt, which may adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\nOur Charter and Bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in our management without the consent of our board of directors. These provisions include:\n\u2022a classified board of directors, with only approximately one-third of our board of directors elected each year;\n\u2022no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022the exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022the ability of our board of directors to determine whether to issue shares of our preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n\u2022a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022the requirement that an annual meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the board of directors, the chief executive officer, or the board of directors, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\n\u2022limiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;\n\u2022controlling the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of stockholder meetings;\n\u2022providing that directors may be removed prior to the expiration of their terms by stockholders only for cause; and\n\u2022advance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the Company.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay hostile takeovers and changes in control of the Company or changes in our board of directors and management.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding voting common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding voting common stock. Any provision of our Charter or Bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their securities and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our securities.", "PERMNO": 16021, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "CDEV"}
