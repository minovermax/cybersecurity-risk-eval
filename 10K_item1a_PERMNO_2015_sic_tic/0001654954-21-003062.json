RISK FACTORS\nAll phases of the Company\u2019s operations are subject to a number of uncertainties, risks and other influences, many of which are outside of its control, and any one or a combination of which could materially affect its results of operations. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company\u2019s expectations are discussed below. Prospective investors should carefully consider these factors before investing in our securities as well as the information set forth under \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d in Item 7 of this report. These risks and uncertainties include:\nRisks Related to Economic Conditions and Events.\nCurrent COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe current COVID-19 pandemic, including the governmental response to it, is having a significant adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, including reduced customer traffic and staffing challenges and could lead to supply difficulties.. All of the Company\u2019s Craft Pizza & Pub restaurants are located in the State of Indiana, the Governor of which has implemented significant restrictions on the operation of restaurants in response to the pandemic. The Company has been addressing these restrictions by (among other things) promoting the Company\u2019s Pizza Valet service, for carry-out, in order to replace a portion of the lost revenue from the dining room, but those efforts may not be fully successful. Many other states and municipalities in the United States have also temporarily suspended the operation of dine-in restaurants in light of COVID-19, which has impacted our franchised operations. Moreover, host facilities for our non-traditional franchises may be adversely impacted by these developments. Additionally, viruses may be transmitted through human contact, and the risk and perceived risk of contracting viruses could cause potential customers to avoid gathering in public places (including restaurants and non-traditional venues), which could further have adverse effects on our non-traditional business or the franchisee\u2019s ability to adequately staff the locations. If any of the Company\u2019s employees are suspected of having been exposed to COVID-19 or other similar illnesses, we could be required to quarantine some or all such employees or close and disinfect our facilities. The Company has experienced several disruptions in supply including due to the temporary closure of certain meat processors. The Company has implemented alternative work-arounds for these disruptions but could face additional supply disruptions to a minor or major degree which could impact the Company\u2019s ability to serve products with the impacted ingredients. The potential of such disruptions has prompted the Company-operated units to take on a larger than normal supply of certain key ingredients. Depending on the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company\u2019s ability to execute its growth plans could be adversely affected. These risks and any additional risks associated with COVID-19 or a similar outbreak may materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business or results of operations, and may impact the Company\u2019s liquidity or financial condition, particularly if these risks persist for a significant amount of time. The COVID-19 pandemic has also adversely affected the Company\u2019s franchising business due to its impact on the operations and financial condition of host facilities as well as constraints on the Company\u2019s historical marketing efforts, including participation in trade shows.\nCompetition from larger companies.\nThe Company competes with large national companies and numerous regional and local companies for franchise and license sales and with respect to its Company-owned locations. Many of its competitors have greater financial and other resources than the Company. The restaurant industry in general is intensely competitive with respect to convenience, price, product quality and service. In addition, the Company competes for franchise and license sales on the basis of several factors, including product engineering and quality, investment cost, cost of sales, distribution, simplicity of operation and labor requirements. Activities of the Company\u2019s competitors could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s ability to sell additional franchises or licenses or maintain and renew existing franchises and licenses or the operating results of the Company\u2019s system.\nDependence on growth strategy.\nThe Company\u2019s growth strategies include selling new franchises or licenses for non-traditional locations and to expand Craft Pizza & Pub locations by franchising to qualified franchisees and gradually increasing the number of Company-owned Craft Pizza & Pub locations. The opening and success of new locations will depend upon various factors, which include: (1) the traffic generated by and viability of the underlying activity or business in non-traditional locations; (2) the viability of the Craft Pizza & Pub locations; (3) the ability of the franchisees and licensees of either venue to operate their locations effectively; (4) the franchisee's ability to comply with applicable regulatory requirements; and (5) the effect of competition and general economic and business conditions including food and labor costs. Many of the foregoing factors are not within the Company\u2019s control. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to achieve its plans with respect to the opening and/or operation of new franchises/licenses for Craft Pizza & Pub or non-traditional locations.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Operations\nDependence on success of franchisees and licensees.\nWhile an increasing portion of its revenues are being generated by Company-owned operations, a significant portion of the Company\u2019s revenues continues to come from royalties and other fees generated by its franchisees and licensees which are independent operators, and their employees are not the Company\u2019s employees. The Company is dependent on the franchisees to accurately report their weekly sales and, consequently, the calculation of royalties. If the franchisees do not accurately report their sales, the Company\u2019s revenue could decline. The Company provides training and support to franchisees and licensees but the quality of the store operations and collectability of the receivables may be diminished by a number of factors beyond the Company\u2019s control. Consequently, franchisees and licensees may not operate locations in a manner consistent with the Company\u2019s standards and requirements, or may not hire and train qualified managers and other store personnel. If they do not, the Company\u2019s image and reputation may suffer, and its revenues and stock price could decline. While the Company attempts to ensure that its franchisees and licensees maintain the quality of its brand and branded products, franchisees and licensees may take actions that adversely affect the value of the Company\u2019s intellectual property or reputation. Initiatives to increase the Federal minimum wage and/or shortage of available labor could have an adverse financial effect on our franchisees/licensees or the Company by increasing the labor cost.\nDependence on distributors.\nThe success of the Company\u2019s license and franchise offerings depends upon the Company\u2019s ability to engage and retain unrelated, third-party distributors. The Company\u2019s distributors collect and remit certain of the Company\u2019s royalties and must reliably stock and deliver products to the Company\u2019s licensees and franchisees. The Company\u2019s inability to engage and retain quality distributors, or a failure by distributors to perform in accordance with the Company\u2019s standards, could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a materially adverse impact on many of the Company\u2019s current distributors as well as other potential distributors, especially those located in or servicing states with significant and/or prolonged restrictions. These potential disruptions in distribution may result in loss of distribution to some areas or result in distribution service under less favorable terms to the Company and its franchisees and licensees.\nDependence on consumer preferences and perceptions.\nThe restaurant industry and the retail food industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes, national, regional and local economic conditions, demographic trends, traffic patterns and the type, number and location of competing restaurants. The Company could be substantially adversely affected by publicity resulting from food quality, illness, an infection pandemic, injury, other health concerns or operating issues stemming from one restaurant or retail outlet or a limited number of restaurants and retail outlets.\nInterruptions in supply or delivery of food products.\nDependence on frequent deliveries of product from unrelated third-party manufacturers through unrelated third-party distributors also subjects the Company to the risk that shortages or interruptions in supply caused by contractual interruptions, market conditions, inclement weather or other conditions could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of ingredients. In addition, factors such as inflation, market conditions for cheese, wheat, meats, paper, labor and other items may also adversely affect the franchisees and licensees and, as a result, can adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to add new franchised or licensed locations.\nFederal, state and local laws with regard to the operation of the businesses.\nThe Company is subject to regulation by the FTC and various state agencies pursuant to federal and state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises. Several states also regulate aspects of the franchisor-franchisee relationship. The FTC requires the Company to furnish to prospective franchisees a disclosure document containing specified information. Several states also regulate the sale of franchises and require registration of a franchise disclosure document with state authorities. Substantive state laws that regulate the franchisor-franchisee relationship presently exist in a substantial number of states, and bills have been introduced in Congress from time to time that would provide for federal regulation of the franchisor-franchisee relationship in certain respects. The state laws often limit, among other things, the duration and scope of non-competition provisions and the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise. Some foreign countries also have disclosure requirements and other laws regulating franchising and the franchisor-franchisee relationship, and the Company would be subject to applicable laws in each jurisdiction where it seeks to market additional franchise units.\nEach franchise and Company-owned location is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities, which include health, safety, sanitation, building, alcohol, employment and other agencies and ordinances in the state or municipality in which the facility is located. The process of obtaining and maintaining required licenses or approvals can delay or prevent the opening of a franchise location. Vendors, such as the Company\u2019s third-party production and distribution services, are also licensed and subject to regulation by state and local health and fire codes, and U. S. Department of Transportation regulations. The Company, its franchisees and its vendors are also subject to federal and state environmental regulations.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Indebtedness\nAbility to service our outstanding indebtedness and the dilutive effect of our outstanding warrants.\nAs of March 1, 2021, the Company has approximately $8.9 million in principal amount debt obligations. Of that debt, $8.2 million is in the form of a senior secured promissory note and $625,000 is in the form of convertible subordinated notes.\nOn February 7, 2020, the Company entered into a Senior Secured Promissory Note and Warrant Purchase Agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) with Corbel Capital Partners SBIC, L.P. (the \u201cPurchaser\u201d). Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company issued to the Purchaser a senior secured promissory note (the \u201cSenior Note\u201d) in the initial principal amount of $8.0 million. The Company has used or will use the net proceeds of the Agreement as follows: (i) $4.2 million was used to repay the Company\u2019s then-existing bank debt which was in the original amount of $6.1 million; (ii) $1.275 million was used to repay the portion of the Company\u2019s outstanding subordinated convertible debt the maturity date of which most had not previously been extended; (iii) debt issuance costs; and (iv) the remaining net proceeds will be used for working capital or other general corporate purposes, including development of new Company-owned Craft Pizza & Pub locations.\nThe Senior Note bears cash interest of LIBOR, as defined in the Agreement, plus 7.75%. In addition, the Note requires payment-in-kind interest (\u201cPIK Interest\u201d) of 3% per annum, which will be added to the principal amount of the Senior Note. Interest is payable in arrears on the last calendar day of each month. The Senior Note matures on February 7, 2025. The Senior Note does not require any fixed principal payments until February 28, 2023, at which time required monthly payments of principal in the amount of $33,333 begin and continue until maturity. The Senior Note requires the Company to make additional payments on the principal balance of the Senior Note based on its consolidated excess cash flow, as defined in the Agreement.\nThe Agreement contains a number of covenants with which the Company must comply, including financial covenants. The Company is currently in compliance with its obligations under the Agreement.\nIn conjunction with the Senior Note, the Company issued to the Purchaser a warrant (the \u201cCorbel Warrant\u201d) to purchase up to 2,250,000 shares of Common Stock. The Corbel Warrant entitles the Purchaser to purchase from the Company, at any time or from time to time: (i) 1,200,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.57 per share (\u201cTranche 1\u201d), (ii) 900,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.72 per share (\u201cTranche 2\u201d), and (iii) 150,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.97 per share (\u201cTranche 3\u201d). The Purchaser is required to exercise the Corbel Warrant with respect to Tranche 1 if the Common Stock is trading at $1.40 per share or higher for a specified period, and is further required to exercise the Corbel Warrant with respect to Tranche 2 if the Common Stock is trading at $1.50 per share or higher for a specified period. Cashless exercise of the Corbel Warrant is only permitted with respect to Tranche 3. The Purchaser has the right, within six months after the issuance of any shares under the Corbel Warrant, to require the Company to repurchase such shares for cash or for put notes, at the Company's discretion. The Corbel Warrant expires on the sixth anniversary of the date of its issuance.\nAdditionally, the Company previously issued certain units (the \u201cUnits\u201d) consisting of a convertible, subordinated, unsecured promissory note (the \u201cNotes\u201d) in an aggregate principal amount of $50,000 and warrants (the \u201cWarrants\u201d) to purchase up to 50,000 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock at a price of $1.00 per share, no par value per share. Following the refinancing described above, $625,000 in principal amount of Notes and the associated Warrants remain outstanding, however, per the terms of the agreement, the Warrants were re-priced to $0.57 per share. These Notes mature, and the associated Warrants expire, in January 2023.\nRisks Related to Human Capital\nDependence on key executives.\nThe Company\u2019s business has been and will continue to be dependent upon the efforts and abilities of its executive staff generally, and particularly Paul W. Mobley, its Executive Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, and A. Scott Mobley, its President and Chief Executive Officer. The loss of either of their services could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Common Stock\nIndiana law with regard to purchases of the Company\u2019s stock.\nCertain provisions of Indiana law applicable to the Company could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire, control of the Company. Such provisions could also limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of its common stock. These provisions include prohibitions against certain business combinations with persons or groups of persons that become \u201cinterested shareholders\u201d (persons or groups of persons who are beneficial owners of shares with voting power equal to 10% or more) unless the board of directors approves either the business combination or the acquisition of stock before the person becomes an \u201cinterested shareholder.\u201d\nInapplicability of corporate governance standards that apply to companies listed on a national exchange.\nThe Company\u2019s stock is quoted on the OTCQB, a Nasdaq-sponsored and operated inter-dealer automated quotation system for equity securities not included on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The Company is not subject to the same corporate governance requirements that apply to exchange-listed companies. These requirements include: (1) a majority of independent directors; (2) an audit committee of independent directors; and (3) shareholder approval of certain equity compensation plans or equity issuances. As a result, quotation of the Company\u2019s stock on the OTCQB limits the liquidity and price of its stock more than if its stock was quoted or listed on a national exchange. There is no assurance that the Company\u2019s stock will continue to be authorized for quotation by the OTCQB or any other market in the future.", "PERMNO": 57753, "SIC": 6794, "TIC": "NROM"}
