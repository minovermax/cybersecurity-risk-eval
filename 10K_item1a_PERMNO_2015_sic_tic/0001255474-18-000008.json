{"cik": "1255474", "company": "WHITING PETROLEUM CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-02-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nEach of the risks described below should be carefully considered, together with all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making an investment decision with respect to our securities. In the event of the occurrence, reoccurrence, continuation or increased severity of any of the risks described below, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nOil and natural gas prices are very volatile. An extended period of low oil and natural gas prices may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe oil and gas markets are very volatile, and we cannot predict future oil and natural gas prices. The price we receive for our oil, NGL and natural gas production heavily influences our revenue, profitability, access to capital and future rate of growth. The prices we receive for our production depend on numerous factors beyond our control, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7\nchanges in regional, domestic and global supply and demand for oil and natural gas;\n\u00b7\nthe level of global oil and natural gas inventories;\n\u00b7\nthe actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries;\n\u00b7\nthe price and quantity of imports of foreign oil and natural gas;\n\u00b7\npolitical and economic conditions, including embargoes, in oil-producing countries or affecting other oil-producing activity, such as the recent conflicts in the Middle East;\n\u00b7\nthe level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production activity;\n\u00b7\nthe effects of global credit, financial and economic issues;\n\u00b7\ndevelopments of United States energy infrastructure;\n\u00b7\nweather conditions;\n\u00b7\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u00b7\ncurrent and anticipated changes to domestic and foreign governmental regulations, including those expected as a result of the election of Donald Trump to the U.S. Presidency;\n\u00b7\nproximity and capacity of oil and natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities;\n\u00b7\nthe price and availability of competitors\u2019 supplies of oil and natural gas in captive market areas;\n\u00b7\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels; and\n\u00b7\nacts of force majeure.\n\ufeff\nMoreover, government regulations, such as regulation of oil and natural gas gathering and transportation, can adversely affect commodity prices in the long term.\nThese factors and the volatility of the energy markets generally make it extremely difficult to predict future oil and natural gas price movements. Also, prices for crude oil and prices for natural gas do not necessarily move in tandem. Declines in oil or natural gas prices would not only reduce revenue, but could also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can economically produce and therefore potentially lower our oil and gas reserve quantities. If the oil and natural gas industry experiences extended periods of low prices, we may, among other things, be unable to meet all of our financial obligations or make planned expenditures.\nSubstantial and extended declines in oil, NGL and natural gas prices have resulted and may continue to result in impairments of our proved oil and gas properties or undeveloped acreage and may materially and adversely affect our future business, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations, liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures. To the extent commodity prices received from production are insufficient to fund planned capital expenditures, we will be required to reduce spending, sell assets or borrow to fund any such shortfall. Lower commodity prices have reduced, and may further reduce, the amount of our borrowing base under our credit agreement, which is determined at the discretion of our lenders based on the collateral value of our proved reserves that have been mortgaged to the lenders, and is subject to regular redeterminations on May 1 and November 1 of each year, as well as special redeterminations described in the credit agreement. Upon a redetermination, if borrowings in excess of the revised borrowing capacity were outstanding, we could be forced to immediately repay a portion of the debt outstanding under our credit agreement.\nLower commodity prices may also make it more difficult for us to comply with the covenants and other restrictions in the agreements governing our debt as described under the risk factor entitled \u201cThe instruments governing our indebtedness contain various covenants limiting the discretion of our management in operating our business.\u201d\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nAlternatively, higher oil prices may result in significant mark-to-market losses being incurred on our commodity-based derivatives, which may in turn cause us to experience net losses.\nDrilling for and producing oil and natural gas are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur future success will depend on the success of our exploration, development and production activities. Our oil and natural gas exploration and development activities are subject to numerous risks beyond our control, including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable oil or natural gas production. Our decisions to purchase, explore, develop or otherwise exploit prospects or properties will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses, production data and engineering studies, the results of which are often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations. Refer to the risk factor entitled \u201cReserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate...\u201d for a discussion of the uncertainty involved in these processes. Our cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is often uncertain before drilling commences. Overruns in budgeted expenditures are common risks that can make a particular project uneconomical. Further, many factors may curtail, delay or cancel drilling, including the following:\n\u00b7\nsubstantial or extended declines in oil, NGL and natural gas prices;\n\u00b7\ndelays imposed by or resulting from compliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7\ndelays in or limits on the issuance of drilling permits on our federal leases, including as a result of government shutdowns;\n\u00b7\npressure or irregularities in geological formations;\n\u00b7\nshortages of or delays in obtaining qualified personnel or equipment, including drilling rigs and completion services;\n\u00b7\nequipment failures or accidents;\n\u00b7\nadverse weather conditions, such as freezing temperatures, hurricanes and storms;\n\u00b7\npipeline takeaway and refining and processing capacity; and\n\u00b7\ntitle problems.\n\ufeff\nOur debt level and the covenants in the agreements governing our debt could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and business prospects.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had no borrowings and $2 million in letters of credit outstanding under Whiting Oil and Gas Corporation\u2019s (\u201cWhiting Oil and Gas\u201d) credit facility with $2.3 billion of available borrowing capacity, as well as $3.2 billion of senior notes and $562 million of convertible senior notes outstanding. We are allowed to incur additional indebtedness, provided that we meet certain requirements in the indentures governing our senior notes and Whiting Oil and Gas\u2019 credit agreement.\nOur level of indebtedness and the covenants contained in the agreements governing our debt could have important consequences for our operations, including:\n\u00b7\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt agreements, including financial and other restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default under Whiting Oil and Gas\u2019 credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes and convertible senior notes;\n\u00b7\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to required payments on debt, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for working capital, capital expenditures and other general business activities;\n\u00b7\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and other activities;\n\u00b7\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u00b7\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to other less leveraged competitors;\n\u00b7\nmaking us vulnerable to increases in interest rates, because debt under Whiting Oil and Gas\u2019 credit agreement is subject to certain rate variability;\n\u00b7\nmaking us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our industry or the economy in general, especially declines in oil and natural gas prices; and\n\u00b7\nwhen oil and natural gas prices decline, our ability to maintain compliance with our financial covenants becomes more difficult and our borrowing base is subject to reductions, which may reduce or eliminate our ability to fund our operations.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe may be required to repay all or a portion of our debt on an accelerated basis in certain circumstances. If we fail to comply with the covenants and other restrictions in the agreements governing our debt, it could lead to an event of default and the acceleration of our repayment of outstanding debt. In addition, if we are in default under the agreements governing our indebtedness, we would not be able to pay dividends on our capital stock. Our ability to comply with these covenants and other restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic and financial conditions. Moreover, the borrowing base limitation on Whiting Oil and Gas\u2019 credit agreement is redetermined on May 1 and November 1 of each year, and may be the subject of special redeterminations described in such credit agreement based on an evaluation of our oil and gas reserves. Because oil and gas prices are principal inputs into the valuation of our reserves, if oil and gas prices remain at their current levels for a prolonged period or go lower, our borrowing base could be reduced at the next redetermination date or during future redeterminations. Upon a redetermination, if borrowings in excess of the revised borrowing capacity were outstanding, we could be forced to immediately repay a portion of our debt outstanding under the credit agreement.\nWe may not have sufficient funds to make such repayments. If we are unable to repay our debt with cash on hand, we could attempt to refinance such debt, sell assets or repay such debt with the proceeds from an equity offering. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on our debt or future borrowings, and equity financings or proceeds from the sale of assets may not be available to pay or refinance such debt. The terms of our debt, including Whiting Oil and Gas\u2019 credit agreement, may also prohibit us from taking such actions. Factors that will affect our ability to raise cash through an offering of our capital stock or debt securities, a refinancing of our debt or a sale of assets include financial market conditions and our market value and operating performance at the time of such offering or other financing. We may not be able to successfully complete any such offering, refinancing or sale of assets.\nIf we cannot make scheduled payments on our indebtedness or otherwise fail to comply with the covenants and other restrictions in the agreements governing our debt, we will be in default and the lenders under Whiting Oil and Gas\u2019 credit agreement and the holders of our senior notes and convertible senior notes could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, and the lenders under Whiting Oil and Gas\u2019 credit agreement could terminate their commitments to loan money and could foreclose against the assets collateralizing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. Further, failing to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants in Whiting Oil and Gas\u2019 credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes and convertible senior notes could result in an event of default, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe instruments governing our indebtedness contain various covenants limiting the discretion of our management in operating our business.\nThe indentures governing our senior notes and convertible senior notes and Whiting Oil and Gas\u2019 credit agreement contain various restrictive covenants that may limit our management\u2019s discretion in certain respects. In particular, these agreements will limit our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things:\n\u00b7\npay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our capital stock;\n\u00b7\nprepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;\n\u00b7\nmake loans and investments;\n\u00b7\nincur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock;\n\u00b7\ncreate certain liens;\n\u00b7\nenter into agreements that restrict dividends or other payments from our restricted subsidiaries to us;\n\u00b7\nsell assets;\n\u00b7\nconsolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and those of our restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole;\n\u00b7\nengage in transactions with affiliates;\n\u00b7\nenter into hedging contracts; and\n\u00b7\ncreate unrestricted subsidiaries.\n\ufeff\nIn addition, Whiting Oil and Gas\u2019 credit agreement requires us, as of the last day of any quarter, to maintain the following ratios (as defined in the credit agreement): (i) a consolidated current assets to consolidated current liabilities ratio (which includes an add back of the available borrowing capacity under the credit agreement) of not less than 1.0 to 1.0, (ii) a total senior secured debt to the last four quarters\u2019 EBITDAX ratio of less than 3.0 to 1.0 during the Interim Covenant Period (defined below), and thereafter a total debt to EBITDAX ratio of less than 4.0 to 1.0, and (iii) a ratio of the last four quarters\u2019 EBITDAX to consolidated cash interest charges of not less than 2.25 to 1.0 during the Interim Covenant Period. Under the credit agreement, the \u201cInterim Covenant Period\u201d is defined as the\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nperiod from June 30, 2015 until the earlier of (i) April 1, 2018 or (ii) the commencement of an investment-grade debt rating period. Also, the indentures under which we issued our senior notes restrict us from incurring additional indebtedness and making certain restricted payments, subject to certain exceptions, unless our fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the indentures) is at least 2.0 to 1.0. If we were in violation of these covenants, then we may not be able to incur additional indebtedness, including under Whiting Oil and Gas\u2019 credit agreement. A substantial or extended decline in oil or natural gas prices may adversely affect our ability to comply with these covenants.\nIf we fail to comply with the restrictions in the indentures governing our senior notes and convertible senior notes, Whiting Oil and Gas\u2019 credit agreement or any other subsequent financing agreements, a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related indebtedness as well as any other indebtedness to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In addition, lenders may be able to terminate any commitments they had made to make further funds available to us. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under Whiting Oil and Gas\u2019 credit agreement, those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. In the event that our lenders or noteholders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets or be able to borrow sufficient funds to repay or refinance that indebtedness. Also, if we are in default under the agreements governing our indebtedness, we will not be able to pay dividends on our capital stock.\nIf oil, NGL and natural gas prices decrease, we may be required to take write-downs of the carrying values of our oil and gas properties.\nAccounting rules require that we periodically review the carrying value of our producing oil and gas properties for possible impairment. Based on specific market factors and circumstances at the time of prospective impairment reviews (which may include depressed oil, NGL and natural gas prices and the continuing evaluation of development plans, production data, economics and other factors) we may be required to write down the carrying value of our oil and gas properties. For example, we recorded a $835 million impairment charge during 2017 for the partial write-down of the Redtail field in Colorado. A write-down constitutes a non-cash charge to earnings. We may incur additional impairment charges in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period recognized.\nFederal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight rock formations. The process involves the injection of mainly water and sand plus a de minimis amount of chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. Hydraulic fracturing has been utilized to complete wells in our most active areas located in the states of Colorado, Montana and North Dakota, and we expect it will also be used in the future. Should our exploration and production activities expand to other states, it is likely that we will utilize hydraulic fracturing to complete or recomplete wells in those areas. The process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions. However, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the \u201cEPA\u201d) also issued guidance in 2014 for permitting authorities and the industry regarding the process for obtaining a permit for hydraulic fracturing involving diesel.\nIn December 2016, the EPA released a final report on the potential impacts of oil and gas fracturing activities on the quality and quantity of drinking water resources in the United States. In addition, in June 2016, the EPA issued a final rule promulgating pretreatment standards for the oil and gas extraction category which would address discharges of wastewater pollutants from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to publicly-owned treatment works. The EPA is also conducting a study of private wastewater treatment facilities accepting oil and gas extraction wastewater. The EPA is collecting data and information regarding the extent to which these facilities accept such wastewater, available treatment technologies (and their associated costs), discharge characteristics, financial characteristics of the facilities, the environmental impacts of discharges and other information.\nOther federal agencies are also examining hydraulic fracturing, including the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Government Accountability Office and the White House Council for Environmental Quality. In March 2015, the U.S. Department of the Interior released a final rule addressing (i) hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian oil and natural gas leases to require validation of well integrity and strong cement barriers between the wellbore and water zones through which the wellbore passes, (ii) disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing to the Bureau of Land Management, (iii) higher standards for interim storage of recovered waste fluids from hydraulic fracturing, and (iv) measures to lower the risk of cross-well contamination with chemicals and fluids used in fracturing operations. This rule was challenged in federal court and in June 2016, the Wyoming District Court hearing the case ruled that the Department of the Interior had exceeded its authority in issuing the rule. In March 2017, Justice Department lawyers representing the Bureau of Land Management asked the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit to stay the government\u2019s previously filed appeal as the Trump Administration was planning to rescind the rules; and in July 2017, the Department of the Interior announced its proposal to rescind the rules, with the public comment period on the proposal closing in September 2017. On December 29, 2017, the Department of the Interior issued a final rule rescinding the 2015 rule.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIn addition, legislation has been introduced in Congress from time to time to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process. Also, some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could ban, restrict or impose additional requirements on activities relating to hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances. For example, in June 2011, Texas enacted a law that requires the disclosure of information regarding the substances used in the hydraulic fracturing process to the Railroad Commission of Texas (the entity that regulates oil and natural gas production in Texas) and the public. Such federal or state legislation could require the disclosure of chemical constituents used in the fracturing process to state or federal regulatory authorities who could then make such information publicly available. Disclosure of chemicals used in the fracturing process could make it easier for third parties opposing hydraulic fracturing to pursue legal proceedings against producers and service providers based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect human health or the environment, including groundwater. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing is regulated at the federal level, our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting requirements or operational restrictions and also to associated permitting delays, litigation risk and potential increases in costs. Further, local governments may seek to adopt, and some have adopted, ordinances within their jurisdictions restricting the use of or regulating the time, place and manner of drilling or hydraulic fracturing. No assurance can be given as to whether or not similar measures might be considered or implemented in the jurisdictions in which our properties are located. If new laws, regulations or ordinances that significantly restrict or otherwise impact hydraulic fracturing are passed by Congress or adopted in the states or local municipalities where our properties are located, such legal requirements could prohibit or make it more difficult or costly for us to perform hydraulic fracturing activities and thereby could affect the determination of whether a well is commercially viable. In addition, restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we are ultimately able to produce in commercially paying quantities and the calculation of our reserves.\nIn addition, in July 2014, a major university and U.S. Geological Survey researchers published a study purporting to find a causal connection between the deep well injection of hydraulic fracturing wastewater and a sharp increase in seismic activity in Oklahoma since 2008. This study, as well as subsequent studies and reports, may trigger new legislation or regulations that would limit or ban the disposal of hydraulic fracturing wastewater in deep injection wells. If such new laws or rules are adopted, our operations may be curtailed while alternative treatment and disposal methods are developed and approved.\nFurther, in May 2014, the EPA published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking under the Toxic Substances Control Act, relating to the disclosure of chemical substances and mixtures used in oil and gas exploration and production. Depending on the precise disclosure requirements the EPA elects to impose, if any, we may be obliged to disclose valuable proprietary information, and failure to do so may subject us to penalties.\nRefer to \u201cHydraulic Fracturing\u201d in Item 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on hydraulic fracturing.\nWe have entered into physical delivery contracts and do not expect to be able to deliver all the oil required under such contracts and, as a result, we expect we will be required to make deficiency payments.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had three physical delivery contracts which require us to deliver fixed volumes of crude oil. One of these contracts is tied to oil production at our Sanish field in Mountrail County, North Dakota, and two are tied to oil production at our Redtail field in Weld County, Colorado. Although, we believe that our production and reserves are sufficient to fulfill the delivery commitment at our Sanish field in North Dakota, if we fail to deliver the committed volumes, we would be required to pay a deficiency payment of $7.00 per undelivered barrel (subject to upward adjustment). At our Redtail field, we have determined that it is not probable that future oil production will be sufficient to meet the minimum volume requirements under our two contracts in this area. On February 1, 2018, we paid $61 million to the counterparty to one of these Redtail delivery contracts to settle all future minimum volume commitments under the agreement. We expect to make periodic deficiency payments under the second Redtail contract that currently total $4.92 per undelivered Bbl (subject to upward adjustment). During 2017, 2016 and 2015, total deficiency payments under these contracts amounted to $66 million, $43 million and $15 million, respectively. Refer to \u201cProperties - Delivery Commitments\u201d for more information about these delivery contracts.\nReserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\nThe process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex. It requires interpretations of available technical data and many assumptions, including assumptions relating to economic factors. Any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn order to prepare our estimates, we must project production rates and timing of development expenditures. We must also analyze available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data. The extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary. The process also requires economic assumptions about matters such as the following:\n\u00b7\nhistorical production from the area compared with production rates from other producing areas;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u00b7\nthe assumed effect of governmental regulation; and\n\u00b7\nassumptions about future prices of oil, NGLs and natural gas including differentials, production and development costs, gathering and transportation costs, severance and excise taxes, capital expenditures and availability of funds.\nTherefore, estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are inherently imprecise. Actual future production; oil, NGL and natural gas prices; revenues; taxes; exploration and development expenditures; operating expenses; and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves will most likely vary from our estimates. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, results of exploration and development, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nYou should not assume that the present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves, as referred to in this report, is the current market value of our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on 12-month average prices and current costs as of the date of the estimate. The 12-month average prices used for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $51.34 per Bbl and $2.98 per MMBtu. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the estimate. If the 12-month average oil prices used to calculate our oil reserves decline by $1.00 per Bbl, then the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2017 would have decreased by $181 million. If the 12-month average natural gas prices used to calculate our natural gas reserves decline by $0.10 per MMBtu, then the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2017 would have decreased by $21 million.\nOur exploration and development operations require substantial capital, and we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, which could lead to a loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves.\nThe oil and gas industry is capital intensive. We make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our business and operations for the exploration, development, production and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves. To date, we have financed capital expenditures through a combination of internally generated cash flows, equity and debt issuances, bank borrowings, agreements with industry partners and oil and gas property divestments. We intend to finance future capital expenditures with cash flow from operations, proceeds from property divestitures, cash on hand and financing arrangements. Our cash flow from operations and access to capital is subject to a number of variables, including:\n\u00b7\nthe prices at which oil and natural gas are sold;\n\u00b7\nour proved reserves;\n\u00b7\nthe level of oil and natural gas we are able to produce from existing wells;\n\u00b7\nthe costs of producing oil and natural gas; and\n\u00b7\nour ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves.\n\ufeff\nIf our revenues or the borrowing base under our credit agreement decrease as a result of lower oil and natural gas prices, operating difficulties, declines in reserves, or for any other reason, then we may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations at current levels.\nWe may, from time to time, need to seek additional financing. There can be no assurance as to the availability or terms of any additional financing. If additional capital is needed, we may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms favorable to us, or at all. If cash generated by operations or available under our revolving credit facility is not sufficient to meet our capital requirements, the failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of our operations relating to the exploration and development of our prospects, which in turn could lead to a possible loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves.\nPart of our business strategy includes selling properties which subjects us to various risks.\nPart of our business strategy includes selling properties when we believe that the sales price realized will provide an above average rate of return for the property or when the property no longer matches the profile of properties we desire to own. However, there is no assurance that such sales will occur in the time frames or with the economic terms we expect. Unless we conduct successful exploration, development and production activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, divestitures of our properties will reduce our proved reserves and potentially our production. We may not be able to develop, find or acquire additional reserves sufficient to replace such reserves and production from any of the properties we sell. Additionally, agreements pursuant to which we sell properties may include terms that survive closing of the sale, including indemnification provisions, which could obligate us to substantial liabilities.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nRisks associated with the production, gathering, transportation and sale of oil, NGLs and natural gas could adversely affect net income and cash flows.\nOur net income and cash flows will depend upon, among other things, oil, NGL and natural gas production and the prices received and costs incurred to develop and produce oil and natural gas reserves. Drilling, production or transportation accidents that temporarily or permanently halt the production and sale of oil, NGLs and natural gas will decrease revenues and increase expenditures. For example, accidents may occur that result in personal injuries, property damage, damage to productive formations or equipment and environmental damages. Any costs incurred in connection with any such accidents that are not insured against will have the effect of reducing net income. Also, we do not have insurance policies in effect that are intended to provide coverage for losses solely related to hydraulic fracturing operations. Refer to the risk factor entitled \u201cFederal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing...\u201d for a discussion of the uncertainty involved in the regulation of hydraulic fracturing. Also, our oil, NGL and natural gas production depends in large part on the proximity and capacity of pipeline systems and transportation facilities which are mostly owned by third parties. The lack of availability or the lack of capacity on these systems and facilities could result in the curtailment of production or the delay or discontinuance of drilling plans. Similarly, curtailments or damage to pipelines and other transportation facilities used to transport oil, NGLs and natural gas production to markets for sale could decrease revenues or increase transportation expenses. Any such curtailments or damage to the gathering systems could also require finding alternative means to transport the oil, NGLs and natural gas production, which alternative means could result in additional costs that will have the effect of increasing transportation expenses.\nAlso, in response to accidents involving rail cars carrying Bakken formation crude oil, the U.S. Department of Transportation (the \u201cDOT\u201d) issued an emergency order in February 2014 that requires rail shippers to test the makeup of such crude oil before transporting it. This move follows the safety alert the DOT issued in January 2014 that Bakken formation crude oil is more flammable than other types of crude oil and has been followed by additional emergency orders and safety advisories and alerts. An accident involving rail cars could result in significant personal injuries and property and environmental damage. In May 2015, the Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration issued new rules applicable to \u201chigh-hazard flammable trains\u201d, discussed in \u201cItem 1 Business - Regulation - Regulation of Sale and Transportation of Oil\u201d above, which could increase transportation expenses. Similarly, regulatory responses to the October 2015 failure at a Southern California underground natural gas storage facility could also lead to increased expenses for underground storage.\nIn addition, drilling, production and transportation of hydrocarbons bear the inherent risk of loss of containment. Potential consequences include loss of reserves, loss of production, loss of economic value associated with the affected wellbore, contamination of air, soil, ground water and surface water, as well as potential fines, penalties or damages associated with any of the foregoing consequences.\nOur acreage must be drilled before lease expiration, generally within three to five years, in order to hold the acreage by production. Failure to drill sufficient wells in order to hold acreage will result in substantial lease renewal costs, or if renewal is not feasible, loss of our lease and prospective drilling opportunities.\nUnless production is established on our undeveloped acreage, the underlying leases will expire. As of December 31, 2017, the portion of our net undeveloped acreage that is subject to expiration over the next three years, if not successfully developed or renewed, is approximately 37% in 2018, 10% in 2019 and 12% in 2020. The cost to renew such leases may increase significantly, and we may not be able to renew such leases on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, on certain portions of our acreage, third-party leases become immediately effective if our leases expire. As such, our actual drilling activities may materially differ from our current expectations, which could adversely affect our business.\nOur acquisition activities may not be successful.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we have made and may continue to make acquisitions of businesses and properties. However, suitable acquisition candidates may not continue to be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable, and acquisitions pose substantial risks to our business, financial condition and results of operations. In pursuing acquisitions, we compete with other companies, many of which have greater financial and other resources to acquire attractive companies and properties. The following are some of the risks associated with acquisitions, including any completed or future acquisitions:\n\u00b7\nsome of the acquired businesses or properties may not produce revenues, reserves, earnings or cash flow at anticipated levels;\n\u00b7\nwe may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to us or that exceed our estimates;\n\u00b7\nwe may be unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and to realize anticipated economic, operational and other benefits in a timely manner, which could result in substantial costs and delays or other operational, technical or financial problems;\n\u00b7\nacquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business, distract management, divert resources and make it difficult to maintain our current business standards, controls and procedures;\n\u00b7\nwe may issue additional equity or debt securities in order to fund future acquisitions; and\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u00b7\nwe may incur losses as a result of title defects.\n\ufeff\nThe unavailability or high cost of additional drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel and oil field services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis or within our budget.\nThe demand for qualified and experienced field personnel to conduct field operations, geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with oil and natural gas prices, causing periodic shortages. Historically, there have been shortages of drilling rigs, completion crews and other oilfield equipment as demand for these items has increased along with the number of wells being drilled and completed. These factors also cause significant increases in costs for equipment, services and personnel. Higher oil and natural gas prices generally stimulate demand and result in increased prices for drilling rigs and other oilfield goods and services. Shortages of field personnel and other professionals, drilling rigs, completion crews, equipment or supplies or price increases could delay or adversely affect our exploration and development operations, which could restrict such operations or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur identified drilling locations are scheduled out over several years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling.\nWe have specifically identified and scheduled drilling locations as an estimation of our future multi-year drilling activities on our existing acreage. These scheduled drilling locations represent a significant part of our growth strategy. Our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties, including oil and natural gas prices, the availability of capital, costs of oil field goods and services, drilling results, our ability to extend drilling acreage leases beyond expiration, regulatory approvals and other factors. Because of these uncertainties, we do not know if the numerous potential drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce oil or gas from these or any other potential drilling locations. As such, our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified, which could in turn adversely affect our business or require us to remove certain proved undeveloped reserves from our proved reserve base if we are unable to drill those PUD locations within the SEC\u2019s 5-year window.\nWe have been an early entrant into new or emerging plays. As a result, our drilling results in these areas are uncertain, the value of our undeveloped acreage may decline and we may incur impairment charges if drilling results are unsuccessful.\nWhile our costs to acquire undeveloped acreage in new or emerging plays have generally been less than those of later entrants into a developing play, our drilling results in these areas are more uncertain than drilling results in areas that are developed and producing. Since new or emerging plays have limited or no production history, we are unable to use past drilling results in those areas to help predict our future drilling results. Therefore, our cost of drilling, completing and operating wells in these areas may be higher than initially expected, and the value of our undeveloped acreage will decline if drilling results are unsuccessful. Furthermore, if drilling results are unsuccessful, we may be required to write down the carrying value of our undeveloped acreage in new or emerging plays. For example, during 2017 we recorded a $12 million non-cash charge for the impairment of undeveloped oil and gas properties where we have no current or future plans to drill. We may also incur such impairment charges in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period taken. Additionally, our rights to develop a portion of our undeveloped acreage may expire if not successfully developed or renewed. Refer to \u201cAcreage\u201d in Item 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information relating to the expiration of our rights to develop undeveloped acreage.\nProperties that we acquire may not produce as projected, and we may be unable to identify liabilities associated with the properties or obtain indemnities from sellers for liabilities they may have created.\nOur business strategy includes a continuing acquisition program. From 2004 through 2017, we completed 21 separate significant acquisitions of producing properties with a combined purchase price of $6.4 billion for estimated proved reserves as of the effective dates of the acquisitions of 445.2 MMBOE. The successful acquisition of producing properties requires assessment of many factors, which are inherently inexact and may be inaccurate, including the following:\n\u00b7\nthe amount of recoverable reserves;\n\u00b7\nfuture oil and natural gas prices;\n\u00b7\nestimates of operating costs;\n\u00b7\nestimates of future development costs;\n\u00b7\ntiming of future development costs;\n\u00b7\nestimates of the costs and timing of plugging and abandonment; and\n\u00b7\nthe assumption of unknown potential environmental and other liabilities, losses or costs, including for example, historical spills or releases for which we are not indemnified or for which our indemnity is inadequate.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOur assessment will not reveal all existing or potential problems, nor will it permit us to become familiar enough with the properties to assess fully their capabilities and deficiencies. In the course of our due diligence, we may not inspect every well, platform, facility or pipeline. Inspections may not reveal structural and environmental problems, such as pipeline corrosion or groundwater contamination, when they are made. We may not be able to obtain contractual indemnities from the seller for liabilities that it created. We may be required to assume the risk of the physical condition of the properties in addition to the risk that the properties may not perform in accordance with our expectations.\nOur use of oil and natural gas price hedging contracts involves only a portion of our anticipated production, may limit higher revenues in the future in connection with commodity price increases and may result in significant fluctuations in our net income.\nWe enter into hedging transactions of our oil and natural gas production revenues to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the price of oil and natural gas. Our hedging transactions to date have consisted of financially settled crude oil and natural gas options contracts, primarily costless collars and swaps, placed with major financial institutions. As of January 23, 2018, we had contracts covering the sale of 1,850,000 barrels of oil per month for all of 2018, which represents approximately 72% of our forecasted 2018 oil production volumes. All of our oil hedges will expire by June 2019. Refer to \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\u201d in Item 7A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for pricing information and a more detailed discussion of our hedging transactions.\nWe may in the future enter into these and other types of hedging arrangements to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the market prices of oil and natural gas, or alternatively, we may decide to unwind or restructure the hedging arrangements we previously entered into. Hedging transactions expose us to risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including if production is less than expected, the other party to the contract defaults on its obligations or there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging agreement and actual prices received. Hedging transactions may limit the benefit we may otherwise receive from increases in the price for oil and natural gas. Our three-way collars only provide partial protection against declines in market prices due to the fact that when the market price falls below the sub-floor, the minimum price we will receive will be NYMEX plus the difference between the floor and the sub-floor. Furthermore, if we do not engage in hedging transactions or unwind hedging transactions we previously entered into, then we may be more adversely affected by declines in oil and natural gas prices than our competitors who engage in hedging transactions. Additionally, hedging transactions may expose us to cash margin requirements.\nWe recognize all gains and losses from changes in commodity derivative fair values immediately in earnings rather than deferring any such amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Consequently, we may experience significant net losses, on a non-cash basis, due to changes in the value of our hedges as a result of commodity price volatility.\nSeasonal weather conditions and lease stipulations adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in some of the areas where we operate.\nOil and gas operations in the Rocky Mountains are adversely affected by seasonal weather conditions and lease stipulations designed to protect various wildlife. In certain areas, drilling and other oil and gas activities can only be conducted during the spring and summer months. This limits our ability to operate in those areas and can intensify competition during those months for drilling rigs, oil field equipment, services, supplies and qualified personnel, which may lead to periodic shortages. Resulting shortages or high costs could delay our operations, cause temporary declines in our oil and gas production and materially increase our operating and capital costs.\nAn increase in the differential or decrease in the premium between the NYMEX or other benchmark prices of oil and natural gas and the wellhead price we receive could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe prices that we receive for our oil and natural gas production generally trade at a discount, but sometimes at a premium, to the relevant benchmark prices such as NYMEX. A negative difference between the benchmark price and the price received is called a differential and a positive difference is called a premium. The differential and premium may vary significantly due to market conditions, the quality and location of production and other risk factors. We cannot accurately predict oil and natural gas differentials and premiums. Increases in the differential and decreases in the premium between the benchmark price for oil and natural gas and the wellhead price we receive could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of our oil and gas operations.\nWe are not insured against all risks. Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured and underinsured events could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil and natural gas, including the possibility of:\n\u00b7\nenvironmental hazards, such as uncontrollable flows of oil, gas, brine, well fluids, toxic gas or other pollution into the environment, including groundwater and shoreline contamination;\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\u00b7\nabnormally pressured formations;\n\u00b7\nmechanical difficulties, such as stuck oil field drilling and service tools and casing collapse;\n\u00b7\nthe loss of well control;\n\u00b7\nfires and explosions;\n\u00b7\npersonal injuries and death; and\n\u00b7\nnatural disasters.\n\ufeff\nAny of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial losses to our company. We may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. If a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance, then it could adversely affect us.\nWe have limited control over activities on properties we do not operate, which could reduce our production and revenues and increase capital expenditures.\nWe operate 82% of our net productive oil and natural gas wells, which represents 88% of our proved developed producing reserves as of December 31, 2017. If we do not operate the properties in which we own an interest, we do not have control over normal operating procedures, expenditures or future development of our properties. The failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations or an operator\u2019s breach of the applicable agreements could reduce our production and revenues. The success and timing of our drilling and development activities on properties operated by others therefore depends upon a number of factors outside of our control, including the operator\u2019s decisions with respect to the timing and amount of capital expenditures, the period of time over which the operator seeks to generate a return on capital expenditures, inclusion of other participants in drilling wells, and the use of technology, as well as the operator\u2019s expertise and financial resources and the operator\u2019s relative interest in the field. Operators may also opt to decrease operational activities following a significant decline in, or a sustained period of low, oil or natural gas prices. Because we do not have a majority interest in most wells we do not operate, we may not be in a position to remove the operator in the event of poor performance. Accordingly, while we use reasonable efforts to cause the operator to act in a prudent manner, we are limited in our ability to do so.\nOur use of 3-D seismic data is subject to interpretation and may not accurately identify the presence of oil and gas, which could adversely affect the results of our drilling operations.\nEven when properly used and interpreted, 3-D seismic data and visualization techniques are only tools used to assist geoscientists in identifying subsurface structures and hydrocarbon indicators and do not enable the interpreter to know whether hydrocarbons are, in fact, present in those structures. In addition, the use of 3-D seismic and other advanced technologies requires greater predrilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies do, and we could incur losses as a result of such expenditures. Thus, some of our drilling activities may not be successful or economical, and our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate for activities in a particular area could decline. We often gather 3-D seismic data over large areas. Our interpretation of seismic data delineates for us those portions of an area that we believe are desirable for drilling. Therefore, we may choose not to acquire option or lease rights prior to acquiring seismic data, and in many cases, we may identify hydrocarbon indicators before seeking option or lease rights in the location. If we are not able to lease those locations on acceptable terms, it would result in our having made substantial expenditures to acquire and analyze 3-D seismic data without having an opportunity to attempt to benefit from those expenditures.\nMarket conditions or operational impediments may hinder our access to oil and gas markets or delay our production.\nIn connection with our continued development of oil and gas properties, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of delays or interruptions of production from wells on these properties, caused by transportation capacity constraints, curtailment of production or the interruption of transporting oil and gas volumes produced. In addition, market conditions or a lack of satisfactory oil and gas transportation arrangements may hinder our access to oil and gas markets or delay our production. The availability of a ready market for our oil, NGL and natural gas production depends on a number of factors, including the demand for and supply of oil, NGLs and natural gas and the proximity of reserves to pipelines and terminal facilities. Our ability to market our production depends substantially on the availability and capacity of gathering systems, pipelines and processing facilities owned and operated by third-parties. Additionally, entering into arrangements for these services exposes us to the risk that third parties will default on their obligations under such arrangements. Our failure to obtain such services on acceptable terms or the default by a third party on their obligation to provide such services could materially harm our business. We may be required to shut in wells for a lack of a market or because access to gas pipelines, gathering systems or processing facilities may be limited or unavailable. If that were to occur, then we would be unable to realize revenue from those wells until production arrangements were made to deliver the production to market.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nWe are subject to complex laws that can affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business.\nExploration, development, production and sale of oil and natural gas are subject to extensive federal, state, local and international regulation. We may be required to make large expenditures to comply with governmental regulations. Matters subject to regulation include:\n\u00b7\ndischarge permits for drilling operations;\n\u00b7\ndrilling bonds;\n\u00b7\nreports concerning operations;\n\u00b7\nwell spacing;\n\u00b7\nunitization and pooling of properties; and\n\u00b7\ntaxation.\n\ufeff\nUnder these laws, we could be liable for personal injuries, property damage and other damages. Failure to comply with these laws also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties. Moreover, these laws could change in ways that could substantially increase our costs. Any such liabilities, penalties, suspensions, terminations or regulatory changes could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations may incur substantial costs and liabilities to comply with environmental laws and regulations.\nOur oil and gas operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the release or disposal of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences; restrict the types, quantities and concentration of materials that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities; limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, incurrence of investigatory or remedial obligations, the imposition of injunctive relief, or certain leases could be cancelled in the event that an agency refuses to issue or delays the issuance of a required permit. Under these environmental laws and regulations, we could be held strictly liable for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination regardless of whether we were responsible for the release or if our operations were standard in the industry at the time they were performed. Private parties, including the surface owners of properties upon which we drill, may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage. We may not be able to recover some or any of these costs from insurance. Moreover, federal law and some state laws allow the government to place a lien on real property for costs incurred by the government to address contamination on the property.\nPresident Trump has indicated that he would work to ease regulatory burdens on industry and on the oil and gas sector, including environmental regulations. However, any executive orders the President may issue or any new legislation Congress may pass with the goal of reducing environmental statutory or regulatory requirements may be challenged in court. In addition, various state laws and regulations (and permits issued thereunder) will be unaffected by federal changes unless and until the state laws and corresponding permits are similarly changed, and any judicial review is completed.\nChanges in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently and may have a materially adverse impact on our business. For example, in 2012, the EPA published final rules under the Federal Clean Air Act (the \u201cCAA\u201d) that subject oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission and storage operations to regulation under the New Source Performance Standards and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants. With regards to production activities, these rules require, among other things, the reduction of volatile organic compound emissions from certain fractured and refractured gas wells for which well completion operations are conducted and, in particular, requiring some of these wells to use reduced emission completions, also known as \u201cgreen completions\u201d, after January 1, 2015. These regulations also establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from production-related wet seal and reciprocating compressors, pneumatic controllers and storage vessels.\nThe EPA announced in 2015 that it would directly regulate methane emissions from oil and natural gas wells for the first time as part of President Obama\u2019s Climate Action Plan. As part of this strategy, in May 2016, the EPA issued three final rules. The EPA issued a final rule that updated the New Source Performance Standards to add requirements that the oil and gas industry reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and to cover additional equipment and activities in the oil and gas production chain. The final rule sets emissions limits for methane, which is the principal greenhouse gas emitted by equipment and processes in the oil and gas sector. This rule applies to new, reconstructed and modified processes and equipment. This rule also expands the volatile organic compound emissions limits to hydraulically fractured oil wells and equipment used across the industry that was not regulated in the 2012 rules. The rule also requires owners and operators to find and repair leaks, also known as \u201cfugitive emissions.\u201d The EPA also issued a final rule known as the Source\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nDetermination Rule, which is intended to clarify when multiple pieces of equipment and activities in the oil and gas industry must be deemed a single source when determining whether major source permitting programs apply under the prevention of significant deterioration, nonattainment new source review preconstruction and operation permit programs under Title V of the CAA (\u201cTitle V\u201d). The final rule defines the term \u201cadjacent\u201d to clarify that equipment and activities in the oil and gas sector that are under common control will be considered part of the same source if they are located near each other - specifically, if they are located on the same site, or on sites that share equipment and are within one quarter of a mile of each other. This rule applies to equipment and activities used for onshore oil and natural gas production, and for natural gas processing. It does not apply to offshore operations. Finally, the EPA also issued a final Federal Implementation Plan (\u201cFIP\u201d) for Indian country, which implements the minor new source review program in Indian country for oil and natural gas production. The FIP will be used instead of site-specific minor new source review preconstruction permits in Indian country and incorporates emissions limits and other requirements from eight federal air standards, including the final New Source Performance Standard, subpart OOOOa. Requirements of the FIP apply throughout Indian country, except non-reservation areas, unless a tribe or the EPA demonstrates jurisdiction for those areas.\nCompliance with such rules could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, which may adversely impact our business. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the CAA and associated state laws and regulations.\nIn 2016, the EPA also issued the first draft of an Information Collection Request, seeking a broad range of information on the oil and gas industry, including: how equipment and emissions controls are, or can be, configured, what installing those controls entails and the associated costs. This includes information on natural gas venting that occurs as part of existing processes or maintenance activities, such as well and pipeline blowdowns, equipment malfunctions and flashing emissions from storage tanks.\nIn June 2017, the EPA proposed staying the final rule implementing certain of the new oil and gas standards for two years while it reconsiders the rules. In November 2017, the EPA issued a notice of data availability for the proposed stay of the rules, with a comment period closing on December 8, 2017.\nWe are currently engaged in discussions with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (the \u201cCDPHE\u201d) concerning certain equipment used in our Redtail facilities and our compliance with various air permits and applicable federal and state air quality laws and regulations over the control of air pollutant emissions from those facilities. We and the CDPHE are negotiating the terms of a settlement agreement to resolve this matter.\nAny increased governmental regulation or suspension of oil and natural gas exploration or production activities that arises out of these incidents could result in higher operating costs, which could in turn adversely affect our operating results. Also, for instance, any changes in laws or regulations that result in more stringent or costly material handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to maintain compliance and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, competitive position or financial condition as well as those of the oil and gas industry in general.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for oil and gas that we produce.\nIn December 2009, the EPA published its findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases (\u201cGHG\u201d) present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to the warming of the earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climate changes. Based on these findings, the EPA has adopted and implemented regulations that restrict emissions of GHG under existing provisions of the CAA, including rules that limit emissions of GHG from motor vehicles beginning with the 2012 model year. The EPA has asserted that these final motor vehicle GHG emission standards trigger the CAA construction and operating permit requirements for stationary sources, commencing when the motor vehicle standards took effect in January 2011. In June 2010, the EPA published its final rule to address the permitting of GHG emissions from stationary sources under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (the \u201cPSD\u201d) and Title V permitting programs. This rule \u201ctailors\u201d these permitting programs to apply to certain stationary sources of GHG emissions in a multi-step process, with the largest sources first subject to permitting. Further, facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their GHG emissions are required to reduce those emissions consistent with guidance for determining \u201cbest available control technology\u201d standards for GHG, which guidance was published by the EPA in November 2010. Also in November 2010, the EPA expanded its existing GHG reporting rule to include onshore oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities. This rule requires reporting of GHG emissions from such facilities on an annual basis.\nIn June 2014, the Supreme Court upheld most of the EPA\u2019s GHG permitting requirements, allowing the agency to regulate the emission of GHG from stationary sources already subject to the PSD and Title V requirements. Certain of our equipment and installations may currently be subject to PSD and Title V requirements and hence, under the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, may also be subject to the installation of controls to capture GHGs. For any equipment or installation so subject, we may have to incur increased compliance costs to capture related GHG emissions.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nIn accordance with President Obama\u2019s Climate Action Plan, in August 2015, the EPA issued a rule to reduce carbon emissions from electric generating units. The rule, commonly called the \u201cClean Power Plan\u201d, requires states to develop plans to reduce carbon emissions from fossil fuel-fired generating units commencing in 2022, with the reductions to be fully phased in by 2030. Each state is given a different carbon reduction target, but the EPA expects that, in the aggregate, the overall proposal will reduce carbon emissions from electric generating units by 32% from 2005 levels. States are given substantial flexibility in meeting their emission reduction targets and can generally choose to lower carbon emissions by replacing higher carbon generation, such as coal or natural gas, with lower carbon generation, such as efficient natural gas units or renewable energy alternatives. Several industry groups and states have challenged the Clean Power Plan in the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, and in February 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the implementation of the Clean Power Plan while it is being challenged in court. The Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit heard oral arguments on the Clean Power Plan in September 2016, but has not yet issued a decision. On March 28, 2017, the Trump Administration issued an executive order directing the EPA to review the Clean Power Plan. On the same day, the EPA filed a motion in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit requesting that the court hold the case in abeyance while the EPA conducts its review of the Clean Power Plan. On October 16, 2017, the EPA published a proposed rule that would repeal the Clean Power Plan. The EPA also stated in the proposed rule that the agency has not determined the scope of any rule to regulate GHG emissions from existing electric generating units, but intends to issue an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking \u201cin the near future.\u201d Several states have already announced their intention to challenge any repeal of the Clean Power Plan. It is not yet clear what changes, if any, will result from the EPA\u2019s proposal, whether or how the courts will rule on the legality of the Clean Power Plan, the EPA\u2019s repeal of the rules, or any future replacement.\nIn addition, both houses of Congress have actively considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHG, and many states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHG, primarily through the development of GHG inventories, GHG permitting and/or regional GHG \u201ccap and trade\u201d programs. Most of these \u201ccap and trade\u201d programs work by requiring either major sources of emissions or major producers of fuels to acquire and surrender emission allowances, with the number of allowances available for purchase reduced each year until the overall GHG emission reduction goal is achieved. In the absence of new legislation, the EPA is issuing new regulations that limit emissions of GHG associated with our operations which will require us to incur costs to inventory and reduce emissions of GHG associated with our operations and which could adversely affect demand for the oil, NGLs and natural gas that we produce. Finally, it should be noted that many scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHG in the atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations.\nUnless we replace our oil and natural gas reserves, our reserves and production will decline, which would adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.\nUnless we conduct successful exploration, development and production activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, our proved reserves will decline as those reserves are produced. Producing oil and natural gas reservoirs are generally characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Our future oil and natural gas reserves and production, and therefore our cash flow and income, are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing and producing our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. We may not be able to develop, find or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production.\nThe loss of senior management or technical personnel could adversely affect us.\nTo a large extent, we depend on the services of our senior management and technical personnel. The loss of the services of our senior management or technical personnel, including Bradley J. Holly, President and Chief Executive Officer; Bruce R. DeBoer, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary; Peter W. Hagist, Senior Vice President, Planning; Rick A. Ross, Senior Vice President, Operations; Michael J. Stevens, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mark R. Williams, Senior Vice President, Exploration and Development; Steven A. Kranker, Vice President, Reservoir Engineering/Acquisitions; or David M. Seery, Vice President, Land, could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We do not maintain, nor do we plan to obtain, any insurance against the loss of any of these individuals.\nSubstantial acquisitions or other transactions could require significant external capital and could change our risk and property profile.\nIn order to finance acquisitions of additional producing or undeveloped properties, we may need to alter or increase our capitalization substantially through the issuance of debt or equity securities, the sale of production payments or other means. These changes in capitalization may significantly affect our risk profile. Additionally, significant acquisitions or other transactions can change the character of our operations and business. The character of the new properties may be substantially different in operating or geological characteristics or geographic location than our existing properties. Furthermore, we may not be able to obtain external funding for additional future acquisitions or other transactions or to obtain external funding on terms acceptable to us.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nCompetition in the oil and gas industry is intense, which may adversely affect our ability to compete.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties, obtaining investment capital, securing oilfield goods and services, marketing oil and natural gas products and attracting and retaining qualified personnel. Many of our competitors possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources substantially greater than ours, which can be particularly important in the areas in which we operate. Those companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and gas properties and exploratory prospects and to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our resources allow for. Our ability to acquire additional prospects and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future in acquiring prospective reserves, developing reserves, marketing hydrocarbons, attracting and retaining quality personnel and raising additional capital.\nIn connection with the passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, new regulations in this area may result in increased costs and cash collateral requirements for the types of oil and gas derivative instruments we use to manage our risks related to oil and gas commodity price volatility.\nOn July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was enacted into law. This financial reform legislation includes provisions that require over-the-counter derivative transactions to be executed through an exchange or centrally cleared. In addition, the legislation provides an exemption from mandatory clearing requirements based on regulations to be developed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the \u201cCFTC\u201d) and the SEC for transactions by non-financial institutions to hedge or mitigate commercial risk. At the same time, the legislation includes provisions under which the CFTC may impose collateral requirements for transactions, including those that are used to hedge commercial risk. However, during drafting of the legislation, members of Congress adopted report language and issued a public letter stating that it was not their intention to impose margin and collateral requirements on counterparties that utilize transactions to hedge commercial risk. Final rules on major provisions in the legislation, like new margin requirements, may be established through rulemakings and would not take effect until 12 months after the date of enactment. Although we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these rulemakings, new regulations in this area may result in increased costs and cash collateral requirements for the types of oil and gas derivative instruments we use to hedge and to otherwise manage our financial risks related to volatility in oil and gas commodity prices.\nWe depend on computer and telecommunications systems, and failures in our systems or cyber security attacks could significantly disrupt our business operations.\nWe have entered into agreements with third parties for hardware, software, telecommunications and other information technology services in connection with our business. In addition, we have developed proprietary software systems, management techniques and other information technologies incorporating software licensed from third parties. It is possible we could incur interruptions from cyber security attacks, computer viruses or malware. We believe that we have positive relations with our related vendors and maintain adequate anti-virus and malware software and controls; however, any interruptions to our arrangements with third parties for our computing and communications infrastructure or any other interruptions to our information systems could lead to data corruption, communication interruption or otherwise significantly disrupt our business operations.\nOur convertible senior notes may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to be influenced by our convertible senior notes. For example, the market price of our common stock could become more volatile and could be depressed by:\n\u00b7\ninvestors\u2019 anticipation of the potential resale in the market of a substantial number of additional shares of our common stock received upon conversion of our convertible senior notes;\n\u00b7\npossible sales of our common stock by investors who view our convertible senior notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in us than owning shares of our common stock; and\n\u00b7\nhedging or arbitrage trading activity that may develop involving our convertible senior notes and our common stock.", "PERMNO": 89901, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "WLL"}
