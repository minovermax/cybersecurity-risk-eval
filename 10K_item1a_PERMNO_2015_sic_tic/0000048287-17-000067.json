RISK FACTORS\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this report should be carefully considered. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nThe existence of various unfavorable macroeconomic and industry factors, or deterioration of economic conditions, for a prolonged period could adversely affect our business operating results or financial condition.\nOffice furniture industry sales are impacted by a variety of macroeconomic factors including service-sector employment levels, corporate profits, small business confidence, commercial construction and office vacancy rates. Industry factors, including corporate restructuring, technology changes, corporate relocations, health and safety concerns, including ergonomic considerations, and the globalization of companies also influence office furniture industry revenues.\nHearth products industry sales are impacted by a variety of macroeconomic factors including housing starts, overall employment levels, interest rates, consumer confidence, energy costs, disposable income and changing demographics. Industry factors, such as technology changes, health and safety concerns and environmental regulation, including indoor air quality standards, also influence hearth products industry revenues. Deterioration of economic conditions or a slowdown in the recovery in the homebuilding industry and the hearth products market could decrease demand for our hearth products and have additional adverse effects on our operating results. Additionally, the decline in oil and other fuel prices has negatively impacted demand for pellet stoves and we expect demand to remain soft in the pellet business while oil and other fuel prices remain low.\nEconomic growth has slowed, and may continue to slow, in several key international markets, including China and India, which could have adverse effects on our international office furniture sales and our operating results.\nDeteriorating economic conditions could affect our business significantly, including: reduced demand for products; insolvency of our dealers resulting in increased provisions for credit losses; insolvency of our key suppliers resulting in product delays; inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products; and decreased customer demand, including order delays or cancellations.\nWe may need to take additional impairment charges related to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nGoodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually, and when an event occurs or circumstances change making it reasonably possible an impairment may exist. We test for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of the year and whenever indicators of impairment exist. We test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the carrying value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting unit. If the fair value is determined to be less than carrying value, a second step is performed to determine the implied fair value of goodwill associated with the reporting unit. If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, the excess represents the amount of goodwill impairment, and accordingly, an impairment is recognized.\nWe estimate the fair values of the reporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of longer term, broad market trends. We combine this trend data with estimates of current economic conditions in the U.S. and other countries where we have a presence, competitor behavior, the mix of product sales, commodity costs, wage rates, the level of manufacturing capacity and the pricing environment. In addition, estimates of fair value are impacted by estimates of the market-participant-derived weighted average cost of capital. Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any. As a result of impairment testing, we recorded goodwill and other long-lived asset impairments of $6 million during 2016.\nThe office furniture and hearth products industries are highly competitive and, as a result, we may not always be successful.\nBoth the office furniture and hearth products industries are highly competitive, with a significant number of competitors in both industries offering similar products. While competitive factors vary geographically and between differing sales situations, typical factors for both industries include: price; delivery and service; product design and features; product quality; strength of dealers and other distributors; and relationships with customers and key influencers, including architects, designers, home-builders and facility managers. Our principal competitors in the office furniture industry include The Global Group, Haworth, Inc., Kimball International, Inc., Steelcase Inc., Herman Miller, Inc., Teknion Corporation and Knoll, Inc. Our principal competitors in the hearth products industry include Travis Industries Inc., Innovative Hearth Products, Wolf Steel Ltd. (Napoleon) and FPI Fireplace Products International Ltd. (Regency). In both industries, most of our top competitors have an installed base of products that can\n- 11-\nbe a source of significant future sales through repeat and expansion orders. These competitors manufacture products with strong acceptance in the marketplace and are capable of developing products that have a competitive advantage over our products.\nOur continued success will depend on many factors, including our ability to continue to manufacture and market high quality, high performance products at competitive prices and our ability to adapt our business model to effectively compete in the highly competitive environments of both the office furniture and hearth products industries. Our success is also subject to our ability to sustain and grow our positive brand reputation and recognition among existing and potential customers and use our brands and trademarks effectively in entering new markets.\nIn both the office furniture and hearth products industries, we also face price competition from our competitors and from new market entrants who primarily manufacture and source products from lower cost countries. Price competition impacts our ability to implement price increases or, in some cases, even maintain prices, which could lower our profit margins. In addition, we may not be able to maintain or raise the prices of our products in response to rising raw material prices and other inflationary pressures.\nThe concentration of our customer base, changes in demand and order patterns from our customers, as well as the increased purchasing power of these customers, could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.\nWe sell our products through multiple distribution channels. These distribution channels have been consolidating and may continue to consolidate in the future. Consolidation may result in a greater proportion of our sales being concentrated in fewer customers. The increased purchasing power exercised by larger customers may adversely affect the prices at which we can successfully offer our products. As a result of this consolidation, changes in the purchase patterns or the loss of a single customer may have a greater impact on our business, operating results or financial condition than the events would have had prior to the consolidation. In fiscal 2016, the Corporation's five largest customers represented approximately 25 percent of its consolidated sales. No single customer accounted for 10 percent or more of the Corporation's consolidated net sales in fiscal 2016.\nThe growth in sales of private-label products by some of our largest office furniture customers may reduce our revenue and adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.\nPrivate-label products are products sold under the name of the distributor or retailer, but manufactured by another party. Some of our largest customers have aggressive private-label initiatives to increase their sales of office furniture. If successful, they may reduce our revenue and inhibit our ability to raise prices and may, in some cases, force us to lower prices, which could result in an adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nIncreases in basic commodity, raw material, component and transportation costs, as well as disruptions to the supply of basic commodities, raw materials and components or transportation and shipping challenges, could adversely affect our profitability.\nFluctuations in the price, availability and quality of the commodities, raw materials and components used in manufacturing could have an adverse effect on our costs of sales, profitability and our ability to meet customers' demand. We source commodities, raw materials and components from domestic and international suppliers for both our office furniture and hearth products. From both domestic and international suppliers, the cost, quality and availability of commodities, raw materials and components, including steel, have been significantly affected in recent years by, among other things, changes in global supply and demand, changes in laws and regulations (including tariffs and duties), changes in exchange rates and worldwide price levels, natural disasters, labor disputes, terrorism and political unrest or instability. These factors could lead to further price increases or supply interruptions in the future. Our profit margins could be adversely affected if commodity, raw material and component costs remain high or escalate further, and we are either unable to offset such costs through strategic sourcing initiatives and continuous improvement programs or, as a result of competitive market dynamics, unable to pass along a portion of the higher costs to our customers.\nWe rely primarily on third-party freight and transportation providers to deliver our products to customers. Increasing demand for freight providers and a shortage of qualified drivers may cause delays in our shipments and increase the cost to ship our products, which may adversely affect our profitability. Additionally, we import and export products and components, primarily using container ships, which load and unload through North American ports. Port-caused delays in the shipment or receipt of products and components, including labor disputes, could cause delayed receipt of our products and components. These delays could cause manufacturing disruptions, increased expense resulting from alternate shipping methods or the inability to meet customer delivery expectations, which may adversely affect our sales and profitability.\n- 12-\nOur efforts to introduce new products to meet customer and workplace requirements may not be successful, which could limit our sales growth or cause our sales to decline.\nTo meet the changing needs of our customers and keep pace with market trends in both the office furniture and hearth products industries, we regularly introduce new products. Trends include changes in workplace and home design and increases in the use of technology and evolving regulatory and industry requirements, including environmental, health, safety and similar standards for the workplace and home and for product performance. The introduction of new products in both industries requires the coordination of the design, manufacturing and marketing of the products, which may be affected by factors beyond our control. The design and engineering of certain new products can take up to a year or more, and further time may be required to achieve client acceptance. In addition, we may face difficulties introducing new products if we cannot successfully align ourselves with independent architects, home-builders and designers who are able to design, in a timely manner, high quality products consistent with our image and our customers' needs. Accordingly, the launch of any particular product may be later or less successful than we originally anticipated. Difficulties or delays introducing new products or lack of customer acceptance of new products could limit our sales growth or cause our sales to decline and may result in an adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nWe have grown, and may continue to grow, our business through acquisitions and alliances, which could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.\nOne of our growth strategies is to supplement our organic growth through acquisitions of, and or strategic alliances with, businesses with technologies or products complimenting or augmenting our existing products or distribution or adding new products or distribution to our business. In the past few years, we acquired OFM, a small office furniture company, and Vermont Castings Group, a hearth stoves and fireplace company. The benefits of these acquisitions, or future acquisitions or alliances may take more time than expected to develop or integrate into our operations, and we cannot guarantee any completed or future acquisitions or alliances will in fact produce any benefits. In addition, acquisitions and alliances involve a number of risks, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention, including significant management time devoted to integrating acquisitions;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in assimilating the operations and products of an acquired business or in realizing projected efficiencies, cost savings and revenue synergies;\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees or customers of the acquired businesses or adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;\n\u2022\nadverse impact on overall profitability if acquired businesses do not achieve the financial results projected in our valuation models;\n\u2022\nreallocation of amounts of capital from other operating initiatives or an increase in our leverage and debt service requirements to pay the acquisition purchase prices, which could in turn restrict our ability to access additional capital when needed or to pursue other important elements of our business strategy;\n\u2022\ninaccurate assessment of undisclosed, contingent or other liabilities or problems and unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition; and\n\u2022\nincorrect estimates made in accounting for acquisitions, incurrence of non-recurring charges and write-off of significant amounts of goodwill that could adversely affect our financial results.\nOur ability to grow through future acquisitions will depend, in part, on the availability of suitable acquisition candidates at an acceptable price, our ability to compete effectively for these acquisition candidates and the availability of capital to complete the acquisitions. These risks could be heightened if we complete several acquisitions within a relatively short period of time. In addition, there can be no assurance we will be able to continue to identify attractive opportunities or enter into any transactions with acceptable terms in the future. If an acquisition is completed, there can be no assurance we will be able to successfully integrate the acquired entity into our operations or achieve sales and profitability justifying our investment in the businesses. Any potential acquisition may not be successful and could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.\nOur continuing activities to reduce structural costs may result in customer disruption and may distract management from other activities.\nAs part of our commitment to taking structural cost out of our business, we regularly close, reconfigure or transform manufacturing and distribution facilities. Over the past several years, we have closed a number of facilities in the United States and internationally. We have implemented, and will continue to implement, restructuring actions to transform our business and reduce our manufacturing footprint. These actions may take longer than anticipated, prove costlier than expected and may distract management from other activities. If we do not fully realize the expected benefits of our restructuring activities, our financial condition and ability to meet customer needs could be negatively affected.\n- 13-\nWe are subject to extensive environmental regulation and have exposure to potential environmental liabilities.\nThe past and present operation and ownership by us of manufacturing facilities and real property are subject to extensive and changing federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to discharges in air, water and land, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances. Compliance with environmental regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position to date; however, compliance with current laws or more stringent laws or regulations which may be imposed on us in the future, stricter interpretation of existing laws or discoveries of contamination at our real property sites which occurred prior to our ownership or the advent of environmental regulation may require us to incur additional expenditures in the future, some of which may be material.\nIncreasing healthcare costs could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe provide healthcare benefits to the majority of our members and are self-insured. Healthcare costs have continued to rise over time, which increases our annual spending on healthcare and could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur inability to improve the quality/capability of our network of independent dealers or the loss of a significant number of dealers could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.\nIn both the office furniture and hearth products industries, we rely in large part on a network of independent dealers to market our products to customers. We also rely upon these dealers to provide a variety of important specification, installation and after-market services to our customers. Some of our dealers may terminate their relationships with us at any time and for any reason. The loss or termination of a significant number of dealer relationships could cause difficulties for us in marketing and distributing our products, resulting in a decline in our sales, which may adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.\nOur international operations expose us to risks related to conducting business in multiple jurisdictions outside the United States.\nWe manufacture, market, and sell our products in international markets, including in China and India. We plan to continue to grow internationally. We primarily sell our products and report our financial results in U.S. dollars; however, our increased business in countries outside the United States exposes us to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Paying our expenses in other currencies can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those expenses in terms of U.S. dollars, which may affect our profits. In the future, any foreign currency appreciation relative to the U.S. dollar would increase our expenses that are denominated in that currency. Additionally, as we report currency in the U.S. dollar, our financial position is affected by the strength of the currencies in countries where we have operations relative to the strength of the U.S. dollar.\nFurther, certain countries have complex regulatory systems which impose administrative and legal requirements which make managing international operations more difficult, including approvals to transfer funds into certain countries. If we are unable to provide financial support to our international operations in a timely manner, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe periodically review our foreign currency exposure and evaluate whether we should enter into hedging transactions.\nOur international sales and operations are subject to a number of additional risks, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nsocial and political turmoil, official corruption and civil and labor unrest;\n\u2022\nrestrictive government actions, including the imposition of trade quotas and tariffs and restrictions on transfers of funds;\n\u2022\nchanges in labor laws and regulations affecting our ability to hire, retain or dismiss employees;\n\u2022\nthe need to comply with multiple and potentially conflicting laws and regulations, including environmental and corporate laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nthe failure of our compliance programs and internal training to prevent violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws;\n\u2022\npreference for locally branded products and laws and business practices favoring local competition;\n\u2022\nless effective protection of intellectual property and increased possibility of loss due to cyber-theft;\n\u2022\nunfavorable business conditions or economic instability in any particular country or region;\n\u2022\ninfrastructure disruptions;\n\u2022\npotentially conflicting cultural and business practices;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in obtaining distribution and support; and\n- 14-\n\u2022\nAbility to repatriate cash held overseas without paying substantial federal income tax.\n\u2022\nChanges to border taxes or other international tax reforms\nRestrictions imposed by the terms of our credit facility may limit our operating and financial flexibility.\nOur credit facility and other financing arrangements may limit our ability to finance operations, service debt or engage in other business activities that may be in our interests. Specifically, our credit facility restricts our ability to incur additional indebtedness, create or incur certain liens with respect to any of our properties or assets, engage in lines of business substantially different than those currently conducted by us, sell, lease, license or dispose of any of our assets, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, make certain restricted payments or take certain restricted actions and enter into certain sale-leaseback arrangements. Our credit facility also requires us to maintain certain financial covenants.\nOur failure to comply with the obligations under our credit facility may result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, may cause accelerated repayment of the indebtedness under the credit facility. We cannot be certain we will have sufficient funds available to pay any accelerated repayments or we will have the ability to refinance accelerated repayments on terms favorable to us or at all.\nCosts related to product defects, including product liability costs, could adversely affect our profitability.\nWe incur various expenses related to product defects, including product warranty costs, product recall and retrofit costs and product liability costs. These expenses relative to product sales vary and could increase. We use chemicals and materials in our products and include components in our products from external suppliers, which we believe are safe and appropriate for their designated use; however, harmful effects may become known which could subject us to litigation, including health-related litigation, and significant losses. We maintain reserves for product defect-related costs based on estimates and our knowledge of circumstances indicating the need for such reserves. We cannot, however, be certain these reserves will be adequate to cover actual product defect-related claims in the future. We also purchase insurance coverage to reduce our exposure to significant levels of product liability claims and maintain a reserve for our self-insured losses based upon estimates of the aggregate liability using claims experience and actuarial assumptions, but we cannot be certain insurance would cover all losses related to product claims. Incorrect estimates or any significant increase in the rate of our product defect expenses could have a material adverse effect on operations.\nWe may require additional capital in the future, which may not be available or may be available only on unfavorable terms.\nOur capital requirements depend on many factors, including our need for capital improvements, tooling, new product development and acquisitions. To the extent our existing capital is insufficient to meet these requirements and cover any losses, we may need to raise additional funds through financings or curtail our growth and reduce our assets. Our ability to generate cash depends on economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that may be beyond our control. Future borrowings or financings may not be available to us under our credit facility or otherwise in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or meet our liquidity needs.\nAny equity or debt financing, if available at all, could have terms unfavorable to us. In addition, financings could result in dilution to our shareholders or the securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our common stock. If our need for capital arises because of significant losses, the occurrence of these losses may make it more difficult for us to raise the necessary capital.\nOur sales to the U.S. government have declined in recent years and our sales to the U.S. state and local governments are subject to uncertain future funding levels and federal, state and local procurement laws and are governed by restrictive contract terms; any of these factors could limit current or future business.\nWe derive a portion of our revenue from sales to various U.S. federal, state and local government agencies and departments. Our ability to compete successfully for and retain business with the U.S. government, as well as with state and local governments, is highly dependent on cost-effective performance. Our government business is highly sensitive to changes in procurement laws; national, international, state and local public priorities; and budgets at all levels of government, which have recently experienced downward pressure and, in the case of the federal budget, are subject to uncertainty. Sales to federal government entities decreased by less than 1 percent in 2016 after decreasing 8 percent in the prior year and may decline going forward, which could adversely impact our operating results.\nOur contracts with government entities are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. The U.S. government, as well as state and local governments, can typically terminate or modify their contracts with us either for their convenience or if we default by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract. A termination\n- 15-\narising out of our default could expose us to liability and impede our ability to compete in the future for contracts and orders with agencies and departments at all levels of government. Moreover, we are subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements governing government contracts, including requirements related to procurement integrity, export controls, employment practices, the accuracy of records and reporting of costs. If we were found to not be a responsible supplier or to have committed fraud or certain criminal offenses, we could be suspended or debarred from all further federal, state or local government contracting.\nChanges in governmental regulation and enforcement priorities may significantly increase our operating costs.\nLaws and regulations are subject to change and differing interpretations, including in the areas of antitrust and competition, foreign corrupt practices, government contracting, securities and public company reporting, labor and employment practices, data protection, fraud and abuse and tax reporting. Changes in the political climate or in existing laws or regulations, or their interpretations, or the enactment of new laws or the issuance of new regulations or changes in enforcement priorities or activity could adversely affect us by, among other things:\n\u2022\nincreasing our administrative, compliance, and other costs;\n\u2022\nincreasing our tax obligations, including unfavorable outcomes from audits performed by various tax authorities;\n\u2022\naffecting cash management practices and repatriation efforts;\n\u2022\nforcing us to alter or restructure our relationships with dealers and customers; and\n\u2022\nrequiring us to implement additional or different programs and systems\nCompliance with regulations is costly and time-consuming, and we may encounter difficulties, delays or significant expenses in connection with such compliance. Should we become the target of a regulatory investigation or enforcement action, we could incur significant costs and suffer damage to our reputation which could adversely impact our business, operating results or financial condition.\nOur implementation and use of a new business software system, and accompanying transformation of our business processes, could result in problems that could negatively impact our business and results of operations.\nWe are engaged in a multi-year, broad-based program, which we refer to as business systems transformation (\"BST\"), to implement new integrated software systems to support and streamline our business processes. In 2016 we implemented BST across several of our smaller operating companies. We expect full implementation across domestic furniture operations during 2017. We anticipate implementation of BST will require transformation of business and financial processes to realize the full benefits of the project. Significant efforts are required to design, test and implement BST, requiring investment of resources, including additional selling, general and administrative and capital expenditures. There can be no assurance other issues relating to BST implementation will not occur, including compatibility issues, integration challenges and delays, and higher than expected implementation costs. Additionally, when implemented, BST could function improperly or not deliver the projected benefits, which could significantly disrupt our business, including our ability to provide quotes, process orders, ship products, invoice customers, process payments, generate management and financial reports and otherwise run our business. Our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if we experience problems related to BST.\nWe rely on information technology systems to manage numerous aspects of our business, and a disruption or failure of these systems could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely upon information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store electronic information as well as to manage numerous aspects of our business and provide information to management. Additionally, we collect and store sensitive data of our customers, suppliers and employees in data centers and on information technology networks. The secure operation of these information technology networks and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to our business operations and strategy. These networks and systems, despite security and precautionary measures, are vulnerable to natural events and malicious activity. Though we attempt to detect and prevent these incidents, we may not be successful. Any disruption of our information technology networks or systems, or access to or disclosure of information stored in or transmitted by our systems, could result in legal claims and damages, loss of intellectual property or other proprietary information, including customer data, disrupt operations, result in competitive disadvantage and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. We are also required to comply with certain information technology standards, including standards imposed by credit card providers regarding the storage, processing and transmission of card holder data. Any failure of our systems to meet these standards could result in our inability to accept certain forms of customer payments or risk of card holder data being breached as described above.\n- 16-\nOur results of operations and earnings may not meet guidance or expectations.\nWe provide public guidance on our expected results of operations for future periods. This guidance is comprised of forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties, including the risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other public filings and public statements, and is based necessarily on assumptions we make at the time we provide such guidance. Our guidance may not always be accurate. If, in the future, our results of operations for a particular period do not meet our guidance or the expectations of investment analysts or if we reduce our guidance for future periods, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly.\nIowa law and provisions in our charter documents may have the effect of preventing or hindering a change in control and adversely affecting the market price of our common stock.\nOur Articles of Incorporation give our Board of Directors the authority to issue up to two million shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights and preferences of the preferred stock without obtaining shareholder approval. The existence of this preferred stock could make it more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of the Corporation by means of a tender offer, merger, proxy contest or otherwise. Furthermore, this preferred stock could be issued with other rights, including economic rights, senior to our common stock, thereby having a potentially adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nOur Board of Directors is divided into three classes. Our classified Board, along with other provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and Iowa corporate law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or remove our directors by means of a proxy contest, even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders. For example, Section 490.1110 of the Iowa Business Corporation Act prohibits publicly held Iowa corporations to which it applies from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested shareholder unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. Further, Section 490.1108A of the Iowa Business Corporation Act permits a board of directors, in the context of a takeover proposal, to consider not only the effect of a proposed transaction on shareholders, but also on a corporation\u2019s employees, suppliers, customers, creditors and on the communities in which the corporation operates. These provisions could discourage others from bidding for our shares and could, as a result, reduce the likelihood of an increase in our stock price that would otherwise occur if a bidder sought to buy our stock.\nWe may, in the future, adopt other measures (such as a shareholder rights plan or \u201cpoison pill\u201d) that could have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing an unsolicited takeover, even if such a change in control were at a premium price or favored by a majority of unaffiliated shareholders. These measures may be adopted without any further vote or action by our shareholders.\nAn inability to protect our intellectual property could have a significant impact on our business.\nWe attempt to protect our intellectual property rights, both in the United States and in foreign countries, through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as licensing agreements and third-party nondisclosure and assignment agreements. Because of the differences in foreign trademark, copyright, patent and other laws concerning proprietary rights, our intellectual property rights do not generally receive the same degree of protection in foreign countries as they do in the United States. In some parts of the world, we have limited protections, if any, for our intellectual property. The degree of protection offered by the claims of the various patents, copyrights, trademarks and service marks may not be broad enough to provide significant proprietary protection or competitive advantages to us, and patents, copyrights, trademarks or service marks may not be issued on our pending or contemplated applications. In addition, not all of our products are covered by patents or similar intellectual property protections. It is also possible that our patents, copyrights, trademarks and service marks may be challenged, invalidated, canceled, narrowed or circumvented.\nIn the past, certain of our products have been copied and sold by others. We try to enforce our intellectual property rights, but we have to make choices about where and how we pursue enforcement and where we seek and maintain intellectual property protection. In many cases, the cost of enforcing our rights is substantial, and we may determine that the costs of enforcement outweigh the potential benefits.\n- 17-\nIf third parties claim that we infringe upon their intellectual property rights, we may incur liabilities and costs and may have to redesign or discontinue an infringing product.\nWe face the risk of claims that we have infringed upon third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights. Companies operating in our industry routinely seek patent protection for their product designs, and many of our principal competitors have large patent portfolios. Prior to launching major new products in our key markets, we normally evaluate existing intellectual property rights. However, our competitors and suppliers may have filed for patent protection which is not, at the time of our evaluation, a matter of public knowledge. Our efforts to identify and avoid infringing upon third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights may not always be successful. Any claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement, even those without merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend; cause us to cease making, licensing or using products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property; require us to redesign, re-engineer, or re-brand our products or packaging, if feasible; or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a third party\u2019s intellectual property.\nNatural disasters, acts of God, force majeure events or other catastrophic events may impact the Corporation's production capacity and, in turn, negatively impact profitability.\nNatural disasters, acts of God, force majeure events or other catastrophic events, including severe weather, military action, terrorist attacks, power interruptions and fires, could disrupt operations and likewise the ability to produce or deliver our products. Several of our production facilities, members and key management are located within a small geographic area in eastern Iowa and a natural disaster or catastrophe in the area could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and business conditions. Further, several of our production facilities are single-site manufacturers of certain products, and an adverse event affecting any of those facilities could significantly delay production of certain products and adversely affect our operations and business conditions. Members are an integral part of our business and events including an epidemic could reduce the availability of members reporting for work. In the event we experience a temporary or permanent interruption in our ability to produce or deliver product, revenues could be reduced, and business could be materially adversely affected. In addition, any continuing disruption in our computer system could adversely affect our ability to receive and process customers' orders, manufacture products and ship products on a timely basis and could adversely affect relations with customers, potentially resulting in reduction in orders from customers or loss of customers. We maintain insurance to help protect us from costs relating to some of these events, but it may not be sufficient or paid in a timely manner in the event we suffer such an event.", "PERMNO": 42439, "SIC": 2522, "TIC": "HNI"}
