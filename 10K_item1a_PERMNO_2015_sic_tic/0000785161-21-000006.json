Some of these risks are described below, and the reader should take such risks into account in evaluating Encompass Health or any investment decision involving Encompass Health. This section does not describe all risks that may be applicable to us, our industry, or our business, and it is intended only as a summary of material risk factors. More detailed information concerning other risks and uncertainties as well as those described below is contained in other sections of this annual report. Still other risks and uncertainties we have not or cannot foresee as material to us may also adversely affect us in the future. If any of the risks below or other risks or uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this annual report are actually realized, our business and financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected. In the event the impact is materially adverse, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nRisks Related to the Strategic Review of Our Home Health and Hospice Business\nWe are reviewing strategic alternatives for our home health and hospice business, but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying or consummating any strategic alternatives, that strategic alternatives will yield additional value for our stockholders, or that exploration of strategic alternatives for our home health and hospice business will not adversely impact our business, financial results or results of operations.\nOn December 9, 2020, we announced that our board of directors proceeded with a more formalized process for exploring strategic alternatives for our home health and hospice business. As part of this strategic review process, a number of options are under consideration, including the full or partial separation of the home health and hospice business from Encompass Health through an initial public offering, spin-off, merger, sale or other transaction. This strategic review is ongoing and may not result in the consummation of any transaction, on any particular timetable or at all. Speculation regarding any developments related to the review of strategic alternatives for our home health and hospice business and perceived uncertainties related to the future of such business or Encompass Health could cause our stock price to fluctuate significantly.\nOur exploration of strategic alternatives for the home health and hospice business exposes us to a number of risks and uncertainties, including diversion of management\u2019s time to the process; the incurrence of significant expenses associated with the review and pursuit of any transaction; increased difficulties in attracting, retaining or motivating key management personnel; and exposure to potential litigation. Any of these factors could disrupt our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or stock price.\nAdditionally, we may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits from a potential transaction or other strategic alternative involving our home health and hospice business. There can be no assurance that any potential transaction or other strategic alternative, if identified, evaluated and consummated, will provide greater value to our stockholders than that reflected in our current stock price. Further, our board of directors may determine to suspend or terminate the exploration of strategic alternatives for our home health and hospice business at any time. Any potential transaction or other outcome of this review process is also dependent upon a number of factors that may be beyond our control, including among other factors, market conditions (including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic), industry trends, regulatory developments, litigation, and the interest of third parties in our business.\nNovel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) Pandemic Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic (the \u201cpandemic\u201d) has significantly affected and is expected to continue to significantly affect our operations, business and financial condition, and our liquidity could be negatively impacted, particularly if the operations of a significant number of acute-care hospitals and physician practices are disrupted for a lengthy period of time.\nThe pandemic has significantly affected and will continue to significantly affect our facilities, employees, business operations, and financial performance, as well as the United States economy and financial markets. The pandemic is still rapidly evolving and much of its impact remains unknown and difficult to predict, with the impact on our operations and financial performance being dependent on numerous factors, including the rate of spread, duration and geographic coverage of the\npandemic; the rate and extent to which the virus mutates; the status of testing capabilities; the development, distribution, and administration of effective vaccines and therapeutic remedies for COVID-19 and any mutant strains; the legal, regulatory and administrative developments related to the pandemic at federal, state, and local levels, such as shelter-in-place orders, facility closures and quarantines; and the infectious disease prevention and control efforts of the Company, governments and third parties. We began experiencing a negative impact on our operations and financial results in March 2020. Although we experienced improvements in operations and financial performance in the third and fourth quarters, the ongoing nature of the pandemic means that new or recurring problems are likely to arise and may have significant negative effects on our business.\nPatient Volumes and Related Risks\nBeginning in mid-March 2020 and continuing through the end of the year, we have experienced decreased patient volumes in both of our operating segments, with the exception of our hospice business, when compared to prior year periods. We believe reduced patient volumes resulted, and may continue to result in specific markets, from a number of conditions related to the pandemic negatively affecting the willingness and ability of patients to seek and receive healthcare services, including: reductions in elective procedures by acute-care hospitals and physician practices; capacity and staffing constraints; restrictive governmental measures, such as travel bans, social distancing requirements, quarantines and shelter-in-place orders; and patient and caregiver fear of infection. In the home health and hospice segment, we also experienced decreases in visits per episode and institutional referrals because of the pandemic, both of which negatively affected pricing for home health.\nWe believe one of the primary drivers of our reduced volumes is the significant reduction in volumes of elective procedures by acute-care hospitals and physician practices. There is also reason to believe patients, because of fear of infection, have delayed or foregone treatment for conditions, such as stroke and heart attack, that are non-elective in nature. As a reminder, a large number of patients are referred to us following procedures or treatment at acute-care hospitals. Other factors related to the pandemic that have led to decreasing patient volumes include: lower acute-care hospital censuses due to shelter-in-place orders, restrictive visitation policies in place at acute-care hospitals that severely limit access to patients and caregivers by our clinical rehabilitation liaisons and care transition coordinators, lock downs of assisted living facilities that prevent our home care and hospice clinicians and other care providers from visiting patients, and heightened anxiety among patients and their family members regarding the risk of exposure to COVID-19 during acute-care and post-acute care treatment. Significant outbreaks of COVID-19 in our markets, hospitals or large acute-care referral sources could further increase patient anxiety and unwillingness to seek treatment from us or otherwise limit referrals. These factors have contributed, and could in the future contribute, to a decline in new patients for both of our operating segments as well as decreases in visits per episode and institutional referrals in our home health segment.\nSupply Chain\nAdditionally, we experienced supply chain disruptions as a result of the pandemic, including shortages and delays, and we have experienced, and are likely to continue to experience, significant price increases in equipment, pharmaceuticals and medical supplies, particularly personal protective equipment, or \u201cPPE.\u201d Beginning in March 2020, we experienced increased supply expenses due to higher utilization of PPE and increased purchasing of other medical supplies and cleaning and sanitization materials as well as higher prices for supplies in shortage. Increased supply expenses are likely to continue into 2021. Shortages of essential PPE and pharmaceutical and medical supplies in the future may also limit our ability to admit and treat patients or lead to employee disputes.\nStaffing and Related Risks\nOur operations and financial results have been and may in the future be adversely affected by staffing shortages where employees must self-quarantine due to exposure to COVID-19 or where employees are unavailable due to a lack of childcare or care for elderly family members (social distancing, quarantines and shelter-in-place orders). Staffing shortages have limited, and may in the future limit, our ability to admit additional patients at a given facility or agency. Delays in obtaining COVID-19 test results may also adversely affect employee availability. In addition to staffing shortages, significant outbreaks or PPE shortages in our markets or hospitals may reduce employee morale or create labor unrest or other workforce disruptions. Staffing shortages or employee relations issues related to COVID-19 may lead to increased compensation expenses and limitations on the ability to admit new patients. In April 2020, we initiated a program for eligible frontline employees to earn additional paid time off in recognition of their outstanding efforts responding to the pandemic. With more than 21,000 employees potentially benefiting from this additional paid time off, we accrued approximately $43 million in salary and benefits expense during the second quarter in connection with this award. We may also experience additional benefit costs related to increased workers\u2019 compensation claims and group health insurance expenses as a result of the pandemic. Additionally, as some employees work from home to comply with pandemic-mitigation protocols, they will rely on remote\naccess to our information systems to a greater extent than normal, which could increase the likelihood and magnitude of a cyber attack on our information systems.\nLegal and Regulatory Environment\nFuture federal, state or local laws, regulations, orders, or other governmental or regulatory actions addressing the pandemic could reduce the number of patients willing or able to seek care with us, potentially adversely affecting our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. State and local executive actions in response to the pandemic, such as shelter-in-place orders, facility closures and quarantines, have in the past, and could in the future, impair our ability to operate or prevent people from seeking care from us. For example, local health departments have restricted our ability to take patients in specific markets for periods of time in reaction to perceived COVID-19 outbreaks. The imposition of a nationwide restriction on travel or other public activities by the federal government could have similar effects in all of our markets.\nWe may also be subject to lawsuits from patients, employees and others alleging exposure to COVID-19 at our facilities. For example, suits on behalf of two former patients alleging COVID-19 exposure have been brought against one of our hospitals. Such actions may involve large damage claims as well as substantial defense costs. Our professional and general liability insurance may not cover all claims against us.\nAdditionally, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act of 2020 (the \u201cCARES Act\u201d), signed into law on March 27, 2020, authorized the cash distribution of relief funds to healthcare providers in response to the pandemic. On April 10, 2020, the United States Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d) began distributing CARES Act relief funds, for which we did not apply, to various of our bank accounts. We refused the CARES Act relief funds, and our banks returned all the funds to HHS. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (the \u201c2021 Budget Act\u201d), signed into law on December 27, 2020, provides for additional provider relief funds. We intend to refuse any additional provider relief funds distributed in the future whether authorized under the CARES Act or the 2021 Budget Act.\nThe foregoing and other disruptions to our business as a result of the pandemic have had and are likely to continue to have an adverse effect on our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Furthermore, assessing the CARES Act and numerous regulatory changes and formulating our response to the pandemic have required our management to devote extensive resources and are likely to continue to do so in the near future, which may negatively affect our ability to implement our business plan and respond to opportunities.\nOther Factors\nThe situation relating to the pandemic, as well as its disruptions to and other potential effects on our business and financial results, remains dynamic. The broader implications for our business and results of operations remain uncertain and will depend on many factors outside our control, including, without limitation, the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the development, distribution and administration of effective vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and individual behaviors. Accordingly, the pandemic is expected to continue to have an adverse effect on our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nReimbursement Risks\nReductions or changes in reimbursement from government or third-party payors could adversely affect our Net operating revenues and other operating results.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our Net operating revenues from the Medicare program. See Item 1, Business, \u201cSources of Revenues,\u201d for a table identifying the sources and relative payor mix of our revenues. In addition to many ordinary course reimbursement rate changes that the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d), adopts each year as part of its annual rulemaking process for various healthcare provider categories, Congress and some state legislatures have periodically proposed significant changes in laws and regulations governing the healthcare system. Many of these changes have resulted in limitations on the increases in and, in some cases, significant roll-backs or reductions in the levels of payments to healthcare providers for services under many government reimbursement programs. There can be no assurance that future governmental initiatives will not result in pricing freezes, reimbursement reductions, or reduced levels of reimbursement increases that are less than the increases we experience in our costs of operation.\nIn March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (as subsequently amended, the \u201c2010 Healthcare Reform Laws\u201d). Many provisions within the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws have impacted or could in the future impact our business, including Medicare reimbursement reductions and promotion of alternative payment models, such as accountable care organizations (\u201cACOs\u201d) and bundled payment initiatives. The Trump administration and the United States Congress have previously attempted, and may in the future attempt, to change or repeal provisions of the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws through both legislative and regulatory action. For example, on December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which eliminated the tax penalty for individuals for failing to enroll in health insurance beginning in 2019. On January 20, 2017, President Trump issued his first executive order titled \u201cMinimizing the Economic Burden of the Patient Protection And Affordable Care Act Pending Repeal,\u201d that directs federal regulators to begin dismantling those laws through regulatory and policy-making processes and procedures, \u201cto the maximum extent permitted by law.\u201d In December 2018, a federal district court in Texas invalidated the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws in their entirety based on the elimination of the tax penalty but postponed enforcement of that decision pending appeal. On December 18, 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court decision but remanded the case for additional analysis on the question of severability. A group of state attorneys general subsequently appealed the case to the Supreme Court of the United States, which heard oral arguments in November 2020 but has yet to rule. The future of the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws as well as the nature and substance of any other healthcare legislation remain uncertain. The Biden administration is likely to take a dramatically different approach to federal healthcare policy than the Trump administration. Any future changes may ultimately impact the provisions of the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws discussed below or other laws or regulations that either currently affect, or may in the future affect, our business.\nFor Medicare providers like us, these laws include reductions in CMS\u2019s annual adjustments to Medicare reimbursement rates, commonly known as a \u201cmarket basket update.\u201d In accordance with Medicare laws and statutes, CMS makes market basket updates by provider type in an effort to compensate providers for rising operating costs. The 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws required reductions, the last of which ended in 2019, in the annual market basket updates for hospital providers ranging from 10 to 75 basis points and for hospice agencies 30 basis points. For home health agencies, the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws directed CMS to improve home health payment accuracy through rebasing home health payments over four years starting in 2014. In addition, the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws require the market basket updates for hospital, home health, and hospice providers to be reduced by a productivity adjustment on an annual basis. The productivity adjustment equals the trailing 10-year average of changes in annual economy-wide private nonfarm business multi-factor productivity. To date, the productivity adjustments have typically resulted in decreases to the market basket updates ranging from 30 to 100 basis points. For fiscal year 2021, the IRF-PPS productivity adjustment resulted in no change to the market basket update.\nOther federal legislation can also have a significant direct impact on our Medicare reimbursement. On August 2, 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which provided for an automatic 2% reduction of Medicare program payments. This automatic reduction, known as \u201csequestration,\u201d began affecting payments received after April 1, 2013. Sequestration has been extended by subsequent legislation, most recently by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019, which was signed into law on August 2, 2019. Under current law each year through fiscal year 2029, the reimbursement we receive from Medicare, after first taking into account all annual payment adjustments including the market basket update, will be reduced by sequestration unless it is repealed or modified before then. The CARES Act temporarily suspended sequestration for the period of May 1 through December 31, 2020. The 2021 Budget Act extends the sequestration suspension through March 31, 2021.\nAdditionally, concerns held by federal policymakers about the federal deficit, national debt levels, or healthcare spending specifically could result in enactment of further federal spending reductions, further entitlement reform legislation affecting the Medicare program, and/or further reductions to provider payments. In October 2014, President Obama signed into law the Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation Act of 2014 (the \u201cIMPACT Act\u201d). The IMPACT Act directs HHS, in consultation with healthcare stakeholders, to implement standardized data collection processes for post-acute quality and outcome measures. Although the IMPACT Act does not specifically call for the implementation of a new post-acute payment system, we believe this act lays the foundation for possible future post-acute payment policies that would be based on patients\u2019 medical conditions and other clinical factors rather than the setting where the care is provided, also referred to as \u201csite neutral\u201d reimbursement. CMS has begun changing current post-acute payment systems to improve comparability of patient assessment data and clinical characteristics across settings, which will make it easier to create a unified payment system in the future. For example, CMS recently established new case-mix classification models for both home health, discussed further below, and skilled nursing facilities which rely on patient characteristics rather than the amount of therapy received to determine payments. Another example is CMS\u2019s implementation of the new patient assessment measures for IRFs discussed below. The IMPACT Act also creates additional data reporting requirements for our hospitals and home health agencies. The precise details of these new reporting requirements, including timing and content, are being developed and implemented by CMS through the regulatory process that we expect will continue to take place over the next several years. We cannot quantify the potential effects of the IMPACT Act on us.\nEach year, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (\u201cMedPAC\u201d), an independent agency, advises Congress on issues affecting Medicare and makes payment policy recommendations to Congress for a variety of Medicare payment systems including, among others, the inpatient rehabilitation facility prospective payment system (the \u201cIRF-PPS\u201d), the home health prospective payment system (\u201cHH-PPS\u201d) and the hospice payment system (\u201cHospice-PS\u201d). MedPAC also provides comments to CMS on proposed rules, including the prospective payment system rules. Congress is not obligated to adopt MedPAC recommendations, and, based on outcomes in previous years, there can be no assurance Congress will adopt MedPAC\u2019s recommendations in a given year. However, MedPAC\u2019s recommendations have, and could in the future, become the basis for legislative or regulatory action.\nIn connection with CMS\u2019s final rulemaking for the IRF-PPS and the HH-PPS in each year since 2008, MedPAC has recommended either no updates to payments or reductions to payments. In a March 2020 report to Congress, MedPAC recommended, among other things, legislative changes to eliminate the update to the fiscal year 2020 Medicare base payment rates for hospice, reduce by 7% the base payment rate under the HH-PPS, and reduce by 5% the base payment rate under IRF-PPS. In the March 2020 report, MedPAC also reiterated a previous recommendation for Congress to increase the IRF outlier payment pool, to be funded by reductions to base Medicare payments rates under the IRF-PPS. This proposal would adversely affect us as we have a relatively low percentage of outlier patients compared to other inpatient rehabilitation providers. The March 2020 report also called on the HHS Secretary to conduct focused medical record reviews on IRFs. In an October 2020 report, MedPAC called for future research into Medicare hospice payments and expressed concerns that aggregate payments substantially exceed costs and that there are outlier utilization patterns in the industry.\nIn a June 2018 report mandated by the IMPACT Act, MedPAC reiterated its recommendation that Congress adopt a unified payment system for all post-acute care (\u201cPAC-PPS\u201d) in lieu of separate systems for inpatient rehabilitation facilities (\u201cIRFs\u201d), skilled nursing facilities, long-term acute care hospitals, and home health agencies. A PAC-PPS would rely on \u201csite neutral\u201d reimbursement based on patients\u2019 medical conditions and other clinical factors rather than the care settings. MedPAC found a PAC-PPS to be feasible and desirable but also suggested many existing regulatory requirements, including the 60% rule discussed below and the requirement for a minimum of three hours of therapy per day, should be waived or modified as part of implementing a PAC-PPS. MedPAC previously estimated, although we cannot verify the methodology or the accuracy of that estimate, a PAC-PPS would result in 15% and 1% decreases to IRF and home health reimbursements, respectively. As a precursor to a unified PAC-PPS, MedPAC discussed in November 2017 a potential recommendation to change the case-mix weights in each post-acute setting for 2019 and 2020 to a blend of the current setting specific weight and the proposed unified PAC-PPS weight, which MedPAC suggested would shift money from for-profit and freestanding IRFs to non-profit and hospital-based IRFs. MedPAC has also called for aligning Medicare regulatory requirements across post-acute providers, although the agency has acknowledged it could take years to complete this effort. Additionally, MedPAC previously has suggested that Medicare should ultimately move from fee-for-service reimbursement to more integrated delivery payment models.\nMedPAC also recommended significant changes to the HH-PPS, some of which CMS incorporated into the new payment system mandated by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, referred to as the Patient-Driven Groupings Model (\u201cPDGM\u201d), and set out in the final rule for the 2019 HH-PPS. Beginning in 2020, PDGM replaced the prior 60-day episode of payment methodology with a 30-day payment period and eliminated therapy usage as a factor in setting payments (that is, more therapy visits led to higher reimbursement). CMS adopted a 4.4% reduction in the base payment rate for 2020 intended to offset the provider behavioral changes that CMS assumed PDGM would drive. The reimbursement and other changes associated with PDGM could have a significant impact on our home health agencies. Likewise, MedPAC\u2019s previously recommended changes to the Hospice-PS, including a wage adjustment and a reduction in the hospice aggregate cap by 20%, could have a significant impact on our hospice agencies.\nWe cannot predict what alternative or additional deficit reduction initiatives, Medicare payment reductions, or post-acute care reforms, if any, will ultimately be adopted or enacted into law, or the timing or effect of any initiatives or reductions. Those initiatives or reductions would be in addition to many ordinary course reimbursement rate changes that CMS adopts each year as part of the market basket update rulemaking process for various provider categories. While we do not expect the drive toward integrated delivery payment models, value-based purchasing, and post-acute site neutrality in Medicare reimbursement to subside, there are well publicized efforts to repeal, supplement, or alter implementation of, various provisions of the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws and substitute yet to be determined healthcare reforms. We cannot predict the nature or timing of any changes to the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws or other laws or regulations that either currently affect, or may in the future affect, our business.\nThere can be no assurance future governmental action will not result in substantial changes to, or material reductions in, our reimbursements. Similarly, we may experience material increases in our operating costs. For example, in 2021, we expect our wage and benefit costs to increase at a rate in excess of our aggregate Medicare reimbursement rate increase. In any given year, the net effect of statutory and regulatory changes may result in a decrease in our reimbursement rate, and that\ndecrease may occur at a time when our expenses are increasing. As a result, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. For additional discussion of how we are reimbursed by Medicare, see Item 1, Business, \u201cRegulatory and Reimbursement Challenges\u201d and \u201cSources of Revenues-Medicare Reimbursement.\u201d\nIn addition, there are increasing pressures, including as a result of the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws, from many third-party payors to control healthcare costs and to reduce or limit increases in reimbursement rates for medical services. Our relationships with managed care and nongovernmental third-party payors, such as health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations, are generally governed by negotiated agreements. These agreements set forth the amounts we are entitled to receive for our services. Our Net operating revenues and our ability to grow our business with these payors could be adversely affected if we are unable to negotiate and maintain favorable agreements with third-party payors.\nQuality reporting requirements could adversely affect the Medicare reimbursement we receive.\nThe focus on alternative payment models and value-based purchasing of healthcare services has, in turn, led to more extensive quality of care reporting requirements. In many cases, the new reporting requirements are linked to reimbursement incentives. For example, under the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws, CMS established new quality data reporting, effective October 1, 2012, for all IRFs. A facility\u2019s failure to submit the required quality data results in a two percentage point reduction to that facility\u2019s annual market basket increase factor for payments made for discharges in the subsequent Medicare fiscal year. Hospitals began submitting quality data to CMS in October 2012. All of our hospitals have met the reporting deadlines to date resulting in no corresponding reimbursement reductions. Similarly, home health and hospice agencies are required to submit quality data to CMS each year, and the failure to do so in accordance with the rules will result in a two percentage point reduction in their market basket updates. For 2021, we expect four of our home health and hospice agencies will incur a reduction in their reimbursement rates.\nAs noted above, the IMPACT Act mandated that CMS adopt several new quality reporting measures for the various post-acute provider types. The adoption of additional quality reporting measures to track and report will require additional time and expense and could affect reimbursement in the future. In healthcare generally, the burdens associated with collecting, recording, and reporting quality data are increasing. Currently, CMS requires IRF and home health providers to track and submit patient assessment data to support the calculation of 17 and 20 quality reporting measures, respectively.\nIn 2015, CMS established a five-year home health value-based purchasing model in nine states to test whether incentives for better care can improve outcomes in the delivery of home health services. The model, which began in 2016, applies a reduction or increase to current Medicare-certified home health agency payments, depending on quality performance, made to agencies in Massachusetts, Maryland, North Carolina, Florida, Washington, Arizona, Iowa, Nebraska, and Tennessee. CMS under the Trump administration approved the expansion of the model to be done through future rulemaking, but there can be no assurance of how, or if, CMS under the Biden administration will continue expansion. As of December 31, 2020, we have 45 home health locations in the states currently included in the model, which account for 22% of our home health Medicare revenue. Performance will be assessed based on several process, outcome, and care satisfaction measures, and the payment adjustments to be applied on an annual basis are set forth in the table below:\nTo date, we have not experienced a decrease in Net operating revenues in excess of $0.5 million in any year. Based on 2020 performance data, we anticipate almost no impact to our 2021 reimbursements. There can be no assurance all of our hospitals and agencies will meet quality reporting requirements or quality performance in the future which may result in one or more of our hospitals or agencies seeing a reduction in its Medicare reimbursements. Regardless, we, like other healthcare providers, are likely to incur additional expenses in an effort to comply with additional and changing quality reporting requirements.\nReimbursement claims are subject to various audits from time to time and such audits may negatively affect our operations and our cash flows from operations.\nWe receive a substantial portion of our revenues from the Medicare program. Medicare reimbursement claims made by healthcare providers, including inpatient rehabilitation hospitals as well as home health and hospice agencies, are subject to audit from time to time by governmental payors and their agents, such as MACs that act as fiscal intermediaries for all\nMedicare billings, auditors contracted by CMS, and insurance carriers, as well as the HHS Office of Inspector General (the \u201cHHS-OIG\u201d), CMS and state Medicaid programs. As noted above, the clarity and completeness of each patient medical file, some of which is the work product of a physician not employed by us, is essential to successfully challenging any payment denials. If the physicians working with our patients do not adequately document, among other things, their diagnoses and plans of care, our risks related to audits and payment denials in general are greater. Depending on the nature of the conduct found in such audits and whether the underlying conduct could be considered systemic, the resolution of these audits could have a material adverse effect in the aggregate on our financial position, results of operation and liquidity.\nIn the context of our inpatient rehabilitation business, one of the prevalent grounds for denying a claim or challenging a previously paid Medicare claim in an audit is that the patient\u2019s treatment in a hospital was not medically necessary. The medical record must support that both the documentation and coverage criteria requirements are met for the hospital stay to be considered medically reasonable and necessary. Medical necessity is an assessment by an independent physician of a patient\u2019s ability to tolerate and benefit from intensive multi-disciplinary therapy provided in an IRF setting. A Medicare claim may be denied or challenged based on an opinion of the auditor that the record did not evidence medical necessity for treatment in an IRF or lacked sufficient documentation to support the conclusion. In the past, we had a MAC that made determinations regarding medical necessity using its own uniquely restrictive interpretations of the CMS coverage rules or imposing otherwise arbitrary conditions not set out in the related rules, which resulted in a significant number of payment denials.\nIn some cases, we believe the reviewing party is not merely challenging the sufficiency of the medical record but is substituting its judgment of medical necessity for that of the attending physician or imposing documentation or other requirements that are not set out in the regulations. We argue that doing so is inappropriate and has no basis in law. When the government or its contractors reject the medical judgment of physicians or impose documentation and other requirements beyond the language of the statutes and regulations, patient access to inpatient rehabilitation as well as our Medicare reimbursement from the related claims may be adversely affected.\nIn August 2017, CMS announced the Targeted Probe and Educate (\u201cTPE\u201d) initiative. Under the TPE initiative, MACs use data analysis to identify healthcare providers with high claim error rates and items and services that have high national error rates. Once a MAC selects a provider for claims review, the initial volume of claims review is limited to 20 to 40 claims. The TPE initiative includes up to three rounds of claims review with corresponding provider education and a subsequent period to allow for improvement. If results do not improve sufficiently after three rounds, the MAC may refer the provider to CMS for further action, which may include extrapolation of error rates to a broader universe of claims or referral to a UPIC or RAC (defined below). As of December 31, 2020, none of our hospitals or agencies have progressed beyond the third round of reviews, so it is unclear how the review process after TPE would proceed. We cannot predict whether the TPE initiative or similar probes or reviews will materially impact our reimbursement or the timeliness of collections from Medicare in the future.\nCMS has developed and instituted various audit programs under which CMS contracts with private companies to conduct claims and medical record audits. These audits are in addition to those conducted by existing MACs. Some contractors are paid a percentage of the overpayments recovered. One type of audit contractor, the Recovery Audit Contractors (\u201cRACs\u201d), receive claims data directly from MACs on a monthly or quarterly basis and are authorized to review previously paid claims. The recovery auditor look back period is limited to six months from the date of service in cases where the hospital submits the claim within three months of the date of service. CMS has previously operated a demonstration project that expanded the RAC program to include prepayment review of Medicare fee-for-service claims from primarily acute care hospitals. It is unclear whether CMS intends to conduct RAC prepayment reviews in the future and if so, what providers and claims would be the focus of those reviews.\nRAC audits of IRFs initially focused on coding errors but subsequently expanded to include medical necessity and billing accuracy reviews. To date, the Medicare payments subject to RAC audit requests represent less than 1% of our Medicare patient discharges from 2010 to 2020. We have appealed substantially all RAC denials arising from these audits using the same process we follow for appealing pre-payment denials by MACs. CMS has authorized RACs to conduct complex reviews of the medical records associated with both IRF and home health reimbursement claims.\nCMS has also established contractors known as the Uniform Program Integrity Contractors (\u201cUPICs,\u201d formerly known as \u201cZPICs\u201d). These contractors are successors to the Program Safeguard Contractors and conduct audits with a focus on potential fraud and abuse issues. Like the RACs, the UPICs conduct audits and have the ability to refer matters to the HHS-OIG or the United States Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d). Unlike RACs, however, UPICs do not receive a specific financial incentive based on the amount of the error. We have, from time to time, received UPIC record requests which have resulted in claim denials on paid claims. In some cases, the UPICs have extrapolated error rates to larger pools of our claims. In the most significant example to date, a UPIC denied less than $2 million in claims but recouped an extrapolated amount of approximately $30 million. We have appealed substantially all UPIC denials, including the recoupment noted above, arising\nfrom these audits using the same process we follow for appealing other denials by contractors and will continue to contest the use of extrapolation in any context.\nAudits may lead to assertions that we have been underpaid or overpaid by Medicare or have submitted improper claims in some instances. Such assertions may require us to incur additional costs to respond to requests for records and defend the validity of payments and claims and may ultimately require us to refund any amounts determined to have been overpaid. In some circumstances auditors have the authority to extrapolate denial rationales to large pools of claims not actually audited, which could greatly increase the impact of the audit. As a result, we may suffer reduced profitability, and we may have to elect not to accept patients and conditions physicians believe can benefit from inpatient rehabilitation. We cannot predict when or how these audit programs will affect us.\nOur third-party payors may also, from time to time, request audits of the amounts paid, or to be paid, to us. We could be adversely affected in some of the markets where we operate if the auditing payor alleges substantial overpayments were made to us due to coding errors or lack of documentation to support medical necessity determinations. Similarly, there can be no assurance that our current or future MACs will not take restrictive interpretations of Medicare coverage rules. Because one MAC has jurisdiction over a significant number of our hospitals and our hospitals derive a substantial portion of their revenue from Medicare, the adoption of restrictive interpretations of coverage rules by that MAC could result in a large number of payment denials and materially and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nDelays in the administrative appeals process associated with denied Medicare reimbursement claims could delay or reduce our reimbursement for services previously provided.\nOrdinary course Medicare pre-payment denials by MACs, as well as denials resulting from widespread probes and audits, are subject to appeal by providers. We have historically appealed a majority of our denials. Due to the sheer number of appeals and various administrative inefficiencies, including a shortage of judges, appeals that are due to be resolved in a matter of months commonly take years to complete. For example, most of our appeals heard in 2020 related to denials received in 2014 and 2015. We believe the process for resolving individual Medicare payment claims that are denied will continue to take several years. Additionally, the number of new denials far exceeds the number of appeals resolved in recent years (except 2020 in which CMS suspended payment reviews for several months because of the public health emergency and 2018) as shown in the following summary of our inpatient rehabilitation segment activity:\nWe currently record our estimates for pre-payment denials and for post-payment audit denials that will ultimately not be collected as a component of Net operating revenues. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, \u201cNet Operating Revenues,\u201d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Given the continuing or increasing delays along with the increasing number of denials in the backlog, we may experience decreases in Net operating revenues and/or decreases in cash flow as a result of increasing accounts receivable, which may in turn lead to a change in the patients and conditions we treat. Any of these impacts could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. Although Congress has considered legislation to reform and improve the Medicare audit and appeals process, we cannot predict what, if any, legislation will be adopted or what, if any, effect that legislation might have on the audit and appeals process.\nIn May 2014, the American Hospital Association and others filed a lawsuit seeking to compel HHS to meet the statutory deadlines for adjudication of denied Medicare claims. In December 2016, the presiding federal district court judge in the lawsuit ordered HHS to eliminate the backlog of appeals by the end of 2020. HHS appealed the federal district court decision, and an appeals court remanded the order for further consideration of how HHS can eliminate the backlog. On November 1, 2018, the district court again ordered HHS to achieve the following reductions: 19% by the end of fiscal year 2019; 49% by the end of fiscal year 2020; 75% by the end of fiscal year 2021; and 100% by the end of fiscal year 2022.\nThe Medicare appeals adjudication process is administered by the Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals (\u201cOMHA\u201d). Beginning in March 2020, OMHA increased the frequency of hearings and the number of claims set at each hearing, which we believe adds to the substantive and procedural deficiencies in the appeals process. We are exploring various remedies to counter those deficiencies. We believe it is too early to determine what impact, if any, these recent changes in the appeals process will have on our long-term success rate or Net operating revenues.We cannot predict what, if any, further action CMS will take to reduce the backlog or how long it will take to resolve our pending appeals of payment denials that are part of the backlog.\nEfforts to reduce payments to healthcare providers undertaken by third-party payors, conveners, and referral sources could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nHealth insurers and managed care companies, including Medicare Advantage plans, may utilize certain third parties, known as conveners, to attempt to control costs. Conveners offer patient placement and care transition services to those payors as well as bundled payment participants, ACOs, and other healthcare providers with the intent of managing post-acute utilization and associated costs. Conveners may influence referral source decisions on which post-acute setting to recommend, as well as how long to remain in a particular setting. Given their focus on perceived financial savings, conveners customarily suggest that patients avoid higher acuity post-acute settings altogether or move as soon as practicable to lower acuity settings. Conveners are not healthcare providers and may suggest a post-acute setting or duration of care that may not be appropriate from a clinical perspective potentially resulting in a costly acute care hospital readmission.\nWe also depend on referrals from physicians, acute care hospitals, and other healthcare providers in the communities we serve. As a result of various alternative payment models, many referral sources are becoming increasingly focused on reducing post-acute costs by eliminating post-acute care referrals or referring patients to post-acute settings other than perceived high-cost rehabilitation hospitals, sometimes without understanding the potential impact on patient outcomes over an entire episode of care. Our ability to attract patients could be adversely affected if any of our hospitals or agencies fail to provide or maintain a reputation for providing high-quality care on a cost-effective basis as compared to other providers.\nChanges in our payor mix or the acuity of our patients could adversely affect our Net operating revenues or our profitability.\nMany factors affect pricing of our services and, in turn, our revenues. For example, in the inpatient rehabilitation segment, these factors include the treating facility\u2019s urban or rural status, the length of stay, the payor and its applicable rate of reimbursement, and the patient\u2019s medical condition and impairment status (acuity). In recent years, our inpatient rehabilitation segment has experienced a shift in payor mix to a slightly larger percentage of Medicaid patients. We could also experience a shift to a lower average patient acuity. Both of these shifts adversely affect pricing growth. See the \u201cSegment Results of Operations-Inpatient Rehabilitation-Net Operating Revenues\u201d section of Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The expansion and growth of Medicaid resulting from provisions of the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws have increased the number of those patients coming to us. Medicaid reimbursement rates are almost always the lowest among those of our payors, and frequently Medicaid patients come to us with other complicating conditions that make treatment more difficult and costly. We cannot predict the growth of, or changes to, Medicaid, but President Biden has stated that he favors extending public health insurance coverage to low income individuals currently ineligible for Medicaid. We cannot predict whether our payor mix will shift to lower reimbursement rate payors. In the future, we may experience shifts in our payor mix or the acuity of our patients that could adversely affect our pricing, Net operating revenues, and profitability.\nOther Regulatory Risks\nThe ongoing evolution of the healthcare delivery system, including alternative payment models and value-based purchasing initiatives, in the United States may significantly affect our business and results of operations.\nThe healthcare industry in general is facing regulatory uncertainty around attempts to improve outcomes and reduce costs, including coordinated care and integrated delivery payment models. In an integrated delivery payment model, hospitals, physicians, and other care providers are reimbursed in a fashion meant to encourage coordinated healthcare on a more efficient, patient-centered basis. These providers are then paid based on the overall value and quality (as determined by outcomes) of the services they provide to a patient rather than the number of services they provide. While this is consistent with our goal and proven track record of being a high-quality, cost-effective provider, broad-based implementation of a new delivery payment model would represent a significant evolution or transformation of the healthcare industry, which may have a significant impact on our business and results of operations.\nIn recent years, HHS has been studying the feasibility of bundling, including conducting a voluntary, multi-year bundling pilot program to test and evaluate alternative payment methodologies. CMS\u2019 voluntary Bundled Payments for Care\nImprovement Advanced (\u201cBPCI Advanced\u201d) initiative began October 1, 2018, runs through December 31, 2023, and covers 29 types of inpatient and three types of outpatient clinical episodes, including stroke and hip fracture. Providers participating in BPCI Advanced are subject to a semi-annual reconciliation process where CMS compares the aggregate Medicare expenditures for all items and services included in a clinical episode against the target price for that type of episode to determine whether the participant is eligible to receive a portion of the savings, or is required to repay a portion of the payment above target. Accordingly, reimbursement may be increased or decreased, compared to what would otherwise be due, based on whether the total Medicare expenditures and patient outcomes meet, exceed or fall short of the targets.\nSimilarly, CMS has established per the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws several separate ACO programs, the largest of which is the Medicare Shared Savings Program (\u201cMSSP\u201d), a voluntary ACO program in which hospitals, physicians, and other care providers pursue the delivery of coordinated healthcare on a more efficient, patient-centered basis. Conceptually, ACOs receive a portion of any savings generated above a certain threshold from care coordination as long as benchmarks for the quality of care are maintained. Under the MSSP, there are two ACO tracks from which participants can choose. Each track offers a different degree to which participants share any savings realized or any obligation to repay losses suffered. The ACO rules adopted by CMS are extremely complex and remain subject to further refinement by CMS. Based on the CMS data below, the MSSP has not experienced meaningful growth in recent years.\nWe continue to evaluate, on a case-by-case basis, appropriate BPCI Advanced and ACO participation opportunities for our hospitals and home health agencies. More than 35 of our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals have signed participation or preferred provider agreements with these alternative payment models. Those hospitals have treated only a limited number of patients under these alternative payment models to date. As of January 1, 2021, our home health and hospice segment is collaborating with approximately 140 alternative payment models, including Next Generation ACOs, MSSP ACOs, and Direct Contracting Models.\nIn December 2020, CMS announced another voluntary alternative payment model initiative, the Geographic Direct Contracting Model (the \u201cGDCM\u201d). Under the GDCM, Direct Contracting Entities (\u201cDCEs\u201d), which can include ACOs, health systems, health care provider groups, and health plans, will take responsibility for the total cost of care for all Medicare beneficiaries in a specific geographic region. DCEs may enter into agreements with preferred providers that provide for payment risk-sharing and offer Medicare beneficiaries benefits not otherwise available under traditional Medicare. The GDCM will be tested over a six-year period in four to ten regions. Many specifics of the GDCM remain unknown at this time, and it is not clear if, or how, the Biden administration will implement the GDCM.\nOn November 16, 2015, CMS published its final rule establishing the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (\u201cCJR\u201d) payment model, which holds acute care hospitals accountable for the quality of care they deliver to Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries for lower extremity joint replacements (i.e., knees and hips) from surgery through recovery. The CJR originally was mandatory for the acute care hospitals in the 67 geographic areas covered. On November 30, 2017, CMS issued a final rule making the CJR voluntary in 33 of those areas. The CJR model\u2019s original five-year term ended in December 2020, but CMS has proposed to extend the model for three years for most providers in the 34 geographic areas with mandatory participation. Under CJR, healthcare providers in the mandatory participation areas are paid under existing Medicare payment systems. However, the acute-care hospital where a joint replacement takes place are held accountable for the quality and costs of care for the entire episode of care - from the time of the original admission through 90 days after discharge. Depending on the quality and cost performance during the entire episode, the acute-care hospital may receive an additional payment or be required to repay Medicare a portion of the episode costs. As a result, CMS believes acute care hospitals are incented to work with physicians and post-acute care providers to ensure beneficiaries receive the coordinated care they need in an efficient manner. Acute care hospitals participating in the CJR model may enter into risk-sharing financial arrangements with post-acute providers, including IRFs and home health agencies. As of December 31, 2020, we operated 26 inpatient rehabilitation hospitals in the 34 areas with mandatory participation, and we operated 9 other hospitals in markets where an acute care hospital voluntarily participated in CJR. CJR has not had a material impact on those hospitals.\nHHS and CMS continue to explore ways to encourage and facilitate increased participation in alternative payment models and value-based purchasing initiatives. For example, the HHS-OIG and CMS finalized rules in 2020 modernizing the Anti-Kickback Statute and Stark law to, in part, promote a more coordinated, value-based system of care. The bundling and ACO initiatives have served as motivating factors for regulators and healthcare industry participants to identify and implement workable coordinated care and integrated delivery payment models. Broad-based implementation of a new delivery payment model would represent a significant transformation for us and the healthcare industry generally. The nature and timing of the evolution or transformation of the current healthcare system to coordinated care delivery and integrated delivery payment models and value-based purchasing remain uncertain. The development of new delivery and payment systems will almost certainly take significant time and expense. Many of the alternative approaches, including those discussed above and the home health value-based purchasing model discussed below, being explored may not work or could change substantially prior to any nationwide implementations. While only a small percentage of our business currently is or is anticipated to be subject to the alternative payment models discussed above, we cannot be certain these models will not be expanded or made standard or new models will not be implemented broadly.\nAdditionally, as the number and types of bundling, direct contracting, and ACO models increase, the number of Medicare beneficiaries who are treated in one of the models increases. Our willingness or inability to participate in integrated delivery payment and other alternative payment models and the referral patterns of other providers participating in those models may limit our access to Medicare patients who would benefit from treatment in inpatient rehabilitation hospitals or by home care services. In an attempt to reduce costs, ACOs may seek to discourage referrals to post-acute care all together. To the extent that acute care hospitals participating in those models do not perceive our quality of care or cost efficiency favorably compared to alternative post-acute providers, we may experience a decrease in volumes and Net operating revenues, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. For further discussion of coordinated care and integrated delivery payment models and value-based purchasing initiatives, the associated challenges, and our efforts to respond to them, see the \u201cExecutive Overview-Key Challenges-Changes to Our Operating Environment Resulting from Healthcare Reform\u201d section of Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOther legislative and regulatory initiatives and changes affecting the industry could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIn addition to the legislative and regulatory actions that directly affect our reimbursement rates or further the evolution of the current healthcare delivery system, other legislative and regulatory changes, including as a result of ongoing healthcare reform, affect healthcare providers like us from time to time. For example, the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws provide for the expansion of the federal Anti-Kickback Law and the False Claims Act (the \u201cFCA\u201d) that, when combined with other recent federal initiatives, are likely to increase investigation and enforcement efforts in the healthcare industry generally. Changes include increased resources for enforcement, lowered burden of proof for the government in healthcare fraud matters, expanded definition of claims under the FCA, enhanced penalties, and increased rewards for relators in successful prosecutions. CMS may also suspend payment for claims prospectively if, in its opinion, credible allegations of fraud exist. The initial suspension period may be up to 180 days. However, the payment suspension period can be extended almost indefinitely if the matter is under investigation by the HHS-OIG or DOJ. Any such suspension would adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nSome states in which we operate have also undertaken, or are considering, healthcare reform initiatives that address similar issues. While many of the stated goals of other federal and state reform initiatives are consistent with our own goal to provide care that is high-quality and cost-effective, legislation and regulatory proposals may lower reimbursements, increase the cost of compliance, decrease patient volumes, promote frivolous or baseless litigation, and otherwise adversely affect our business. We cannot predict what healthcare initiatives, if any, will be enacted, implemented or amended, or the effect any future legislation or regulation will have on us.\nOn September 30, 2019, CMS adopted a new rule as called for by the IMPACT Act that revises the discharge planning requirements applicable to our inpatient rehabilitation hospitals and home health agencies. Effective November 29, 2019, CMS now requires every hospital (including IRFs) to have a discharge planning process that focuses on patients\u2019 goals and preferences and on preparing them and, as appropriate, their caregivers, to be active partners in their post-discharge care. For our hospitals, this rule requires instituting standardized procedures to identify those patients who are likely to suffer adverse health consequences upon discharge in the absence of adequate discharge planning and to provide a discharge planning evaluation for such patients to ensure that appropriate arrangements for post-hospital care will be made before discharge. At the time of discharge, a hospital must transfer or refer the patient, along with all necessary medical information pertaining to the patient\u2019s current course of illness and treatment, post-discharge goals of care, and treatment preferences, to the appropriate post-acute care service providers and suppliers, facilities, agencies, and other outpatient service providers and practitioners responsible for the patient\u2019s follow-up or ancillary care. Patients must also be informed of all post-acute providers in the area and, for patients enrolled in managed care organizations, in network providers must be identified if the hospital has that\ninformation. Additional information must be provided to patients who are discharged home and referred for home health agency services or who are referred to other post-acute care services.\nFor home health agencies, the final rule includes several new requirements, including that home health agencies develop and implement an effective discharge planning process. Home health agencies must also send certain medical and other information to the post-discharge facility or health care practitioner, and comply with requests for additional information as may be necessary for treatment of the patient made by the receiving facility or health care practitioner. The rule will likely require implementation of new processes and modification of existing discharge forms and reports, and patient visits may need to be extended in order to accommodate patient education. We expect to incur additional one-time and recurring expenses in both our segments to comply with the new requirements, but at this time we cannot predict what the final impact will be. In areas where we are not part of a managed care network with significant enrollment, this discharge planning rule may negatively affect the number of patients choosing us.\nIn accordance with requirements adopted pursuant to the IMPACT Act, CMS implemented requirements to publish certain Medicare spending per beneficiary measures for each inpatient rehabilitation hospital in October 2016 and each home health agency in January 2017. The intent of tracking and publishing this data is to evaluate a given provider\u2019s payment efficiency relative to the efficiency of the national median provider in that provider\u2019s post-acute segment. CMS believes this measure will encourage improved efficiency and coordination of care in the post-acute setting by holding providers accountable for Medicare resource use during an episode of care. However, the measures may be misleading as they do not incorporate patient outcomes associated with those resources used. CMS has not proposed to compare payment efficiency across provider segments.\nIn June 2019, CMS commenced the Home Health Review Choice Demonstration (\u201cRCD\u201d) in Illinois. RCD is intended to test whether pre-claim review improves methods for the identification, investigation, and prosecution of Medicare fraud and whether the pre-claim review helps reduce expenditures while maintaining or improving quality of care. Under RCD, providers may choose pre-claim review or post-payment review of all Medicare claims submitted or elect not to participate, in which case they will incur a 25% payment reduction on all claims. If a home health agency elects to participate in the review and 90% or more of its claims are found to be valid during the six month pre-claim review period, that agency may then opt out of the RCD review, except for spot reviews of samples consisting of 5% of total claims. CMS implemented RCD in Ohio in September 2019. RCD was scheduled to expand to Texas in March 2020 and to North Carolina and Florida in May 2020. In late March 2020, however, CMS announced it was pausing the RCD for home health services in Illinois, Ohio, and Texas and that it would not start RCD in North Carolina and Florida until after the COVID-19 public health emergency ended. On August 21, 2020, CMS announced a new \u201cphased-in approach\u201d to the RCD due to the public health emergency and subsequently announced the delay of the phased-in participation of the RCD in Florida and North Carolina until March 31, 2021. As a result, North Carolina and Florida agencies may submit pre-claim review requests for billing periods beginning August 31, 2020. Cycle 1 of the RCD in Texas ended on September 30, 2020, and we achieved an affirmation rate greater than 90%.\nWe operate agencies (representing approximately 43% of our home health Medicare claims) in the five RCD states. We expect this demonstration project will require us to incur additional administrative and staffing costs and may impact the timeliness of claims payment given that Medicare administrative contractors in Illinois in a prior version of the project had difficulty processing pre-claim reviews on a timely basis. Accordingly, we may experience temporary decreases in Net operating revenues and in cash flow, or we may incur costs associated with patient care for which the Medicare claim is subsequently denied, which could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nOn December 14, 2020, CMS announced the proposal of a five-year review choice demonstration for inpatient rehabilitation services. CMS plans to implement the demonstration in Alabama, and then expand to Pennsylvania, Texas, and California in 2021. We operate 44 inpatient rehabilitation hospitals (representing approximately 33% of our IRF Medicare claims) in those four states. After the initial four states, CMS will expand the demonstration to include additional IRFs based on the Medicare Administrative Contractor to which those IRFs submit claims. Under the demonstration, participating IRFs would have an initial choice between pre-claim or post-payment review of 100% of claims submitted to demonstrate compliance with applicable Medicare coverage and clinical documentation requirements. Under the pre-claim review choice, services could begin prior to the submission of the review request and continue while the decision is being made. The pre-claim review request with required documentation must be submitted and reviewed before the final claim is submitted for payment. Under the post-payment review choice, IRFs would provide services, submit all claims for payment following their normal processes, and then submit required documentation for medical review. If 90% or more of its claims are found to be valid during the six-month review period, the IRF may then opt out of the RCD review, except for spot reviews of samples consisting of 5% of total claims. The IRF RCD would not create new documentation requirements. A number of key details on this proposal have yet to be released, and it is not clear if, or how, the Biden administration will implement this demonstration.\nAs discussed above, MedPAC makes healthcare policy recommendations to Congress and provides comments to CMS on Medicare payment related issues. Congress is not obligated to adopt MedPAC\u2019s recommendations, and, based on outcomes in previous years, there can be no assurance Congress will adopt any given MedPAC recommendation. For example, in March and June 2020, MedPAC issued reports to Congress again recommending several possible changes, which MedPAC has advocated previously, to various post-acute payment systems. One possible change discussed was an increase to outlier payments to be funded by reductions to non-outlier payments rates under the IRF-PPS. This change would adversely impact us compared to other IRF providers because our hospitals have also historically averaged significantly less Medicare reimbursement for high cost outlier patients than other providers have averaged.\nWe cannot predict what legislative or regulatory reforms or changes, if any, will ultimately be enacted, or the timing or effect any of those changes or reforms will have on us. If enacted, they may be challenging for all providers and have the effect of limiting Medicare beneficiaries\u2019 access to healthcare services and could have a material adverse impact on our Net operating revenues, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. For additional discussion of healthcare reform and other factors affecting reimbursement for our services, see Item 1, Business, \u201cRegulatory and Reimbursement Challenges\u201d and \u201cSources of Revenues-Medicare Reimbursement.\u201d\nCompliance with the extensive laws and government regulations applicable to healthcare providers requires substantial time, effort and expense, and if we fail to comply with them, we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations.\nHealthcare providers are required to comply with extensive and complex laws and regulations at the federal, state, and local government levels. These laws and regulations relate to, among other things:\n\u2022licensure, certification, enrollments, and accreditation;\n\u2022policies, either at the national or local level, delineating what conditions must be met to qualify for reimbursement under Medicare (also referred to as coverage requirements);\n\u2022coding and billing for services;\n\u2022requirements of the 60% compliance threshold under the 2007 Medicare Act;\n\u2022relationships with physicians and other referral sources, including physician self-referral and anti-kickback laws;\n\u2022quality of medical care;\n\u2022use and maintenance of medical supplies and equipment;\n\u2022maintenance and security of patient information and medical records;\n\u2022minimum staffing;\n\u2022acquisition and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances; and\n\u2022disposal of medical and hazardous waste.\nIn the future, changes in these laws or regulations or the manner in which they are enforced could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our hospitals, equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure programs, operating procedures, and contractual arrangements, as well as the way in which we deliver home health and hospice services. Those changes could also affect reimbursements as well as future compliance, training, and staffing costs. For example, the 2021 Budget Act creates a new Medicare survey program for hospice agencies which will require a survey at least once every three years. Hospices that are found to be out of compliance could be subjected to new civil monetary penalties that accrue according to days out of compliance, as well as other forms of corrective action.\nExamples of regulatory changes that can affect our business, beyond direct changes to Medicare reimbursement rates, can be found from time to time in CMS\u2019s annual rulemaking. For example, the final rule for the fiscal year 2010 IRF-PPS implemented new coverage requirements which provided in part that a patient medical record must document a reasonable expectation that, at the time of admission to an IRF, the patient generally required and was able to participate in the intensive rehabilitation therapy services uniquely provided at IRFs. CMS has also taken the position that a patient\u2019s medical file must appropriately document the rationale for the use of group therapies, as opposed to one-on-one therapy. Beginning on October 1,\n2015, CMS instituted a new data collection requirement pursuant to which IRFs must capture the minutes and mode (individual, group, concurrent, or co-treatment) of therapy by specialty. Additionally, from time to time CMS has adopted changes in the medical conditions that will presumptively count toward the 60% compliance threshold to qualify for reimbursement as an inpatient rehabilitation hospital.\nOf note, the HHS-OIG periodically updates a work plan that identifies areas of compliance focus. In recent years, the HHS-OIG work plans for IRFs have focused on, among other items, the appropriate utilization of concurrent and group therapy and adverse and temporary harm events occurring in IRFs. In January 2020, the HHS-OIG announced an active work plan to focus on incentives under the IRF-PPS to discharge patients prematurely to home health agencies and appropriate documentation to support claims by home health and hospice agencies, which is expected to be issued in 2021. In September 2020, the HHS-OIG announced an active work plan to focus on infection control at home health agencies during the COVID-19 pandemic, also expected to be issued in 2021. In January 2021, the HHS-OIG announced an audit to evaluate home health services provided by agencies during the COVID-19 public health emergency to determine which types of skilled services were furnished via telehealth, and whether those services were administered and billed in accordance with Medicare requirements. Another active work plan provides that the HHS-OIG will determine if hospice patients are receiving the required visits by registered nurses.\nIn September 2018, the HHS-OIG released a report purporting to identify a high error rate (approximately 80% of claims) among inpatient rehabilitation hospital admissions in a small sample of 220 claims. Based on its findings, the HHS-OIG extrapolated the error rate to the universe of inpatient rehabilitation claims and, among other things, recommended reevaluation of the IRF-PPS. However, that HHS-OIG report involved an extremely small sample size, was not a random sample of cases, included some citations to coverage requirements that did not match actual regulations, appeared to conflate technical documentation requirements with medical necessity determinations, and was at odds with actual MAC reviews of claims during that same timeframe which found substantially lower error rates. The HHS-OIG work plan, audit or similar future efforts could result in proposed changes to the payment systems for providers or increased denials of Medicare claims for patients notwithstanding the referring physicians\u2019 judgment that treatment is appropriate.\nAs the recent HHS-OIG work plans demonstrate, the clarity and completeness of each patient medical file, some of which is the work product of a physician not employed by us, are essential to demonstrating our compliance with various regulatory and reimbursement requirements. For example, to support the determination that a patient\u2019s IRF treatment was reasonable and necessary, the file must contain, among other things, an admitting physician\u2019s assessment of the patient as well as a post-admission assessment by the treating physician and other information from clinicians relating to the plan of care and the therapies being provided. These physicians are not employees. They exercise independent medical judgment. We and our hospital medical directors, who are independent contractors, provide training on a regular basis to the physicians who treat patients at our hospitals regarding appropriate documentation. However, we ultimately do not and cannot control the physicians\u2019 medical judgment. In connection with subsequent payment audits and investigations, there can be no assurance as to what opinion a third party may take regarding the status of patient files or the physicians\u2019 medical judgment evidenced in those files.\nOn March 4, 2013, we received document subpoenas from an office of the HHS-OIG addressed to four of our hospitals. On April 24, 2014, we received document subpoenas relating to an additional seven of our hospitals. Those subpoenas requested documents, including copies of patient medical records, related to reimbursement claims submitted during periods ranging from January 2008 through December 2013. The associated investigation led by DOJ was based on whistleblower claims of alleged improper or fraudulent claims submitted to Medicare and Medicaid and requested documents and materials relating to practices, procedures, protocols and policies of certain pre- and post-admissions activities at these hospitals including marketing functions, pre-admission screening, post-admission physician evaluations, patient assessment instruments, individualized patient plans of care, and compliance with the Medicare 60% rule. Under the Medicare rule commonly referred to as the \u201c60% Rule,\u201d 60% or more of the patients of an IRF must have at least one of a specified list of medical conditions in order to be reimbursed at the IRF-PPS payment rates, rather than at the lower acute care hospital payment rates. We settled the DOJ investigation, together with the related qui tam or whistleblower lawsuits, in 2019 for a total payment of $48 million. In return for the settlement payment, the plaintiffs dismissed with prejudice their pending qui tam claims, and DOJ provided Encompass Health and all its subsidiaries with a release from civil liability.\nAlthough we have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial time, effort, and expense in implementing and maintaining training programs as well as internal controls and procedures designed to ensure regulatory compliance, we have in the past been, and could in the future be, required to return portions of reimbursements for discharges alleged after the fact to have not been appropriate under the applicable reimbursement rules and change our patient admissions practices going forward. We could also be subjected to other liabilities, including (1) criminal penalties, (2) civil penalties, including monetary penalties and the loss of our licenses to operate one or more of our hospitals, and (3) exclusion or suspension of one or more of our\nhospitals from participation in the Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal and state healthcare programs, which, if lengthy in duration and material to us, could potentially trigger a default under our credit agreement or debt instruments.\nBecause Medicare comprises a significant portion of our Net operating revenues, failure to comply with the laws and regulations governing the Medicare program and related matters, including anti-kickback and anti-fraud requirements, could materially and adversely affect us. As discussed above in connection with the 2010 Healthcare Reform Laws, the federal government has in the last couple of years made compliance enforcement and fighting healthcare fraud top priorities. In the past few years, DOJ and HHS as well as federal lawmakers have significantly increased efforts to ensure strict compliance with various reimbursement related regulations as well as combat healthcare fraud. DOJ has pursued and recovered record amounts based on alleged healthcare fraud. The increased enforcement efforts have frequently included aggressive arguments and interpretations of laws and regulations that pose risks for all providers. For example, the federal government has increasingly asserted that incidents of erroneous billing or record keeping may represent violations of the FCA. Human error and oversight in record keeping and documentation, particularly where those activities are the responsibility of non-employees, are always a risk in business, and healthcare providers and independent physicians are no different. Additionally, the federal government has been willing to challenge the medical judgment of independent physicians in determining issues such as the medical necessity of a given treatment plan.\nSettlements of alleged violations or imposed reductions in reimbursements, substantial damages and other remedies assessed against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Even the assertion of a violation, depending on its nature, could have a material adverse effect upon our stock price or reputation and could cost us significant time and expense to defend.\nThe use of sub-regulatory guidance, statistical sampling, and extrapolation by CMS, Medicare contractors, HHS-OIG, and DOJ to deny claims, expand enforcement claims, and advocate for changes in reimbursement policy increases the risk that we could experience reduced revenue, suffer penalties, or be required to make significant changes to our operations.\nBecause Medicare comprises a significant portion of our Net operating revenues, failure to comply with the laws and regulations governing the Medicare program and related matters, including anti-kickback and anti-fraud requirements, could materially and adversely affect us. Our ability to operate in a compliant manner impacts the claims denials, compliance enforcement, and regulatory processes discussed in other risks above. The federal government\u2019s reliance on sub-regulatory guidance, such as handbooks, FAQs, internal memoranda, and press releases, presents a unique challenge to compliance efforts. Such sub-regulatory guidance purports to explain validly promulgated regulations but often expands or supplements existing regulations without constitutionally and statutorily required notice and comment and other procedural protections. Without procedural protections, sub-regulatory guidance poses a risk above and beyond reasonable efforts to follow validly promulgated regulations, particularly when the agency or MAC seeking to enforce such sub-regulatory guidance is not the agency or MAC issuing the guidance and therefore not as familiar with the substance and nature of the underlying regulations or even clinical issues involved.\nOn August 6, 2020, CMS issued a proposed rule invoking a rarely used retroactive-rulemaking authority to support CMS\u2019s application of a Medicare payment methodology that the U.S. Supreme Court found to be procedurally improper in Azar v. Allina Health Services in 2019. CMS\u2019 invocation of its retroactive-rulemaking authority in response to this Supreme Court decision is an unfavorable precedent for providers because it demonstrates a willingness by CMS to revive adverse reimbursement actions after those actions are deemed deficient on administrative procedural grounds.\nAdditionally, the federal government is increasingly turning to statistical sampling and extrapolation to expand claims denials and enforcement efforts and advocate for changes in reimbursement policy. Through sampling and extrapolation, the government takes a review of a small number of reimbursement claims and generalizes the results of that review to a much broader universe of claims, which can result in significant increases in the aggregate number and value of claims at issue. Increasing use of extrapolation can be found in payment review audits, such as those conducted by RACs and UPICs. In addition to payment reviews, government agencies may allege compliance violations, including submission of false claims, based on sampling and extrapolation and seek to change reimbursement policy. For example, the HHS-OIG issued a report in September 2018 purporting to identify a high error rate (approximately 80% of claims) among inpatient rehabilitation hospital admissions in a small sample of 220 claims. Based on its findings, the HHS-OIG extrapolated the error rate to the universe of inpatient rehabilitation claims and, among other things, recommended reevaluation of the IRF-PPS. However, the HHS-OIG report involves an extremely small sample size, is not a random sample of cases, includes incorrect references to coverage requirement regulations, appears to conflate technical documentation requirements with medical necessity determinations, and is at odds with actual MAC reviews of claims during that same timeframe which found substantially lower error rates. Notwithstanding the technical statistical flaws that can arise in sampling small groups of claims and the extremely problematic nature of extrapolation in the context of individualized decisions of medical judgment as some courts have noted, sampling and extrapolation pose a growing risk to healthcare providers in the form of more significant claims of overpayments and increased\nlegal costs to defend against these problematic regulatory practices. In a recent federal court case, the fifth circuit court of appeals ruled in favor of CMS and affirmed the application of extrapolation errors identified in a sample of claims to support larger claims for overpayment. Any associated loss of revenue or increased legal costs could materially and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe Hospital Pricing Transparency Rule could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nEffective on January 1, 2021, the hospital price transparency rule requires hospitals to publish on the internet in a consumer-friendly format their standard charges based on negotiated rates for all items and services and up to 300 common shoppable services. Shoppable services are those routinely provided in non-urgent situations and include those ancillary services that customarily accompany the primary service being provided. The charges for an individual item or service to be published include:\n\u2022gross charge (charge as reflected on a hospital\u2019s chargemaster, absent any discounts),\n\u2022payer-specific negotiated charge (charge negotiated with a third party payer for an item or service),\n\u2022de-identified minimum negotiated charge (lowest charge negotiated with all third-party payers),\n\u2022de-identified maximum negotiated charge (highest charge negotiated with all third-party payers), and\n\u2022discounted cash price (charge that applies to an individual who pays cash).\nThis rule imposes significant initial and ongoing burdens on hospitals to track and publish various billing information. In the event a hospital fails to comply with the new requirements and does not complete the prescribed corrective action, CMS may impose a civil monetary penalty of up to $300 per day.\nMany states have also passed or are debating legislation establishing price transparency websites or mandating that health plans or hospitals make price information available to consumers. The associated reporting obligations vary from state to state. We cannot predict what the adverse effects, if any, of this new CMS rule or any state law or regulation, such as the effect on relations with managed care payors and referral sources, may be for us.\nEfforts to comply with regulatory mandates to increase the use of electronic health data and health system interoperability may lead to enforcement and negative publicity which could adversely affect our business.\nFor many years, a primary focus of the healthcare industry has been to increase the use of electronic health records, or \u201cEHR,\u201d and the sharing of the health data among providers, payors and other members of the industry. The federal government has been a significant driver of that initiative through rules and regulations. In 2009, as part of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, the federal government set aside $27 billion of incentives for hospitals and providers to adopt EHR systems. In 2020, CMS and HHS\u2019s Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT (\u201cONC\u201d) finalized policy changes implementing interoperability, information blocking, and patient access provisions of the 21st Century Cures Act and supporting the MyHealthEData initiative, designed to allow patients to access their health claims information electronically through the application of their choosing. The companion rules will transform the way in which healthcare providers, health information technology developers, health information exchanges/health information networks (\u201cHIEs/HINs\u201d), and health plans share patient information. For example, the ONC rule prohibits healthcare providers, health IT developers, and HIEs/HINs from engaging in practices that are likely to interfere with, prevent, materially discourage, or otherwise inhibit the access, exchange or use of electronic health information, also known as \u201cinformation blocking.\u201d The ONC rule also requires regulated actors to respond to requests for electronic health information in the content and manner requested, with some exceptions. Enforcement of ONC\u2019s and CMS\u2019 new health information access, exchange, and use standards promulgated in the 2020 rules will begin in 2021, and noncompliance can result in civil monetary penalties, exclusion from participation in federal health care programs and other appropriate \u201cdisincentives\u201d that have not yet been identified by the agencies. The HHS-OCR patient right of access initiative, which began in late 2019 and has similar objectives to the new ONC initiative, such as promoting and enforcing patient access to health information, has led to 13 settlements of enforcement actions to date.\nThe goals of increased use of electronic health data and interoperability are improved quality of care and lower healthcare costs generally. However, increased use of electronic health data and interoperability inherently magnifies the risk of security breaches involving that data and information systems, which risk is discussed above. Additionally, the sharing of health information, that is interoperability, has received increasingly negative publicity. There is at least one well publicized instance where organizations received significant negative publicity for sharing health data despite having appeared to comply in all respects with privacy law. There can be no assurance that our efforts to improve the care we deliver and to comply with the law\nthrough increasing use of electronic data and system interoperability will not receive negative publicity that may materially and adversely affect our ability to get patient referrals or enter into joint ventures with other providers or may lead to greater regulatory scrutiny. Negative publicity may also lead to federal or state regulation that conflicts with current federal policy and interferes with the healthcare industry\u2019s efforts to improve care and reduce costs through use of electronic data and interoperability.\nIf any of our hospitals or home health or hospice agencies fail to comply with the Medicare enrollment requirements or conditions of participation, that hospital or agency could be terminated from the Medicare program.\nEach of our hospitals and home health and hospice agencies must comply with extensive enrollment requirements and conditions of participation for the Medicare program. If any fail to meet any of the Medicare enrollment requirements or conditions of participation, we may receive a notice of deficiency from the applicable survey agency or contractor, as applicable. If that hospital or agency then fails to institute an acceptable plan of correction and correct the deficiency within the applicable correction period, it could lose the ability to bill Medicare. A hospital or agency could be terminated from the Medicare program if it fails to address the deficiency within the applicable correction period. If CMS terminates one hospital or agency, it may increase its scrutiny of others under common control.\nOn September 5, 2019, CMS released a final rule that will implement over a period time additional provider enrollment provisions and create several new revocation and denial authorities in an attempt to bolster CMS\u2019 efforts to prevent waste, fraud and abuse. A few provisions of this new rule could significantly increase the complexity of filing enrollment applications for all of our provider entities, including increased burden related to tracking and identifying required reporting data from our joint venture partners. This rule requires Medicare and Medicaid providers and suppliers to disclose any current or previous (in the last five years), direct or indirect affiliation with a provider or supplier that has ever had a disclosable event. A disclosable event is any uncollected debt to Medicare or Medicaid, payment suspension under a federal health care program, denial, revocation or termination of enrollment (even if it is under appeal), or exclusion by the HHS-OIG from participation in a federal health care program. The rule also broadens the definition of an affiliation, including many indirect ownership or control situations such as ownership interests in a publicly traded company. If CMS determines an affiliation with a disclosable event poses an undue risk of fraud, waste or abuse, then the provider reporting that affiliation may be subject to exclusion from Medicare. Currently, information regarding uncollected debt, payment suspensions and enrollment actions are not generally available, so obtaining such information on affiliates could prove difficult or impossible in some situations. CMS intends to issue further guidance on the level of effort it expects providers to undertake to uncover information on their affiliates.\nUnder this new rule, CMS may revoke a provider\u2019s Medicare enrollment, including all of the provider\u2019s locations, if the provider bills for services performed at or items furnished from one location that it knew or should have known did not comply with Medicare enrollment requirements, including making the disclosures discussed above. CMS has the ability to prevent applicants from enrolling in the program for up to three years if a provider is found to have submitted false or misleading information in its initial enrollment application. Additionally, CMS can now block providers and suppliers who are revoked from re-entering the Medicare program for up to 10 years. CMS may also revoke a provider\u2019s enrollment if it fails to report on a timely basis any change in ownership or control, revocation or suspension of a federal or state license or certification, or any other change in its enrollment data.\nAny termination of one or more of our hospitals or agencies from the Medicare program for failure to satisfy the enrollment requirements or conditions of participation could materially adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOther Operational and Financial Risks\nThe proper function, availability, and security of our information systems are critical to our business and failure to maintain proper function, availability, or security of our information systems or protect our data against unauthorized access could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe are and will remain dependent on the proper function, availability and security of our and third-party information systems, including our electronic clinical information system, referred to as ACE-IT, which plays a substantial role in the operations of the hospitals, and the information systems currently in use by our home health and hospice business. We undertake measures to protect the safety and security of our information systems and the data maintained within those systems, and we periodically test the adequacy of our security and disaster recovery measures. We have implemented administrative, technical and physical controls on our systems and devices in an attempt to prevent unauthorized access to that data, which includes patient information subject to the protections of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and other sensitive information. For additional discussion of these laws, see Item 1, Business, \u201cRegulation.\u201d\nWe expend significant capital to protect against the threat of security breaches, including cyber attacks, email phishing schemes, malware and ransomware. Substantial additional expenditures may be required to respond to and remediate any problems caused by breaches, including the unauthorized access to or theft of patient data and protected health information stored in our information systems and the introduction of computer malware or ransomware to our systems. We also provide our employees annual training and regular reminders on important measures they can take to prevent breaches and other cyber threats, including phishing schemes. We routinely identify attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems. However, given the rapidly evolving nature and proliferation of cyber threats, there can be no assurance our training and network security measures or other controls will detect, prevent or remediate security or data breaches in a timely manner or otherwise prevent unauthorized access to, damage to, or interruption of our systems and operations. For example, it has been widely reported that many well-organized international interests, in certain cases with the backing of sovereign governments, are targeting the theft of patient information and the disruption of healthcare services through the use of advance persistent threats. Similarly, in recent years, several hospitals have reported being victims of ransomware attacks in which they lost access to their systems, including clinical systems, during the course of the attacks. In 2020, one large, national healthcare system reported a ransomware attack that forced its facilities to operate without access to information systems for some time. We are likely to face attempted attacks in the future. Accordingly, we may be vulnerable to losses associated with the improper functioning, breach or unavailability of our and our vendors\u2019 information systems, including systems used in acquired operations, and third-party systems we use.\nIn December 2020, it was reported that a sophisticated, well-funded state-sponsored threat actor implanted a backdoor security vulnerability in a widely used network monitoring software sold by SolarWinds, which software was then distributed to thousands of customers, including numerous government agencies and companies in the private sector, via an automatic update platform used to push out new software updates. Three of our servers downloaded the compromised software. The vulnerability was designed to enable hackers to install and execute additional malware that could be used to exfiltrate and facilitate remote access to data possessed by these government agencies and companies. The full scope of the security threat and extent of exploitation of the vulnerability is not yet known. Promptly after we learned of the compromised SolarWinds software update, we identified, isolated and remediated the malicious update then reviewed and ensured we were implementing the recommended security practices provided by industry and government experts. We also conducted a forensics investigation using all the indicators of compromise provided by leading security experts. Our forensic analysis to date has discovered no indicators of compromise. We continue to monitor this situation closely and work with our cyber security vendors, as well as industry and governmental cyber security partners combating this threat.\nTo date, we are not aware of having experienced a material compromise from a cyber breach or attack. However, given the increasing cyber security threats in the healthcare industry, there can be no assurance we will not experience business interruptions; data loss, ransom, misappropriation or corruption; theft or misuse of proprietary, patient or other personally identifiable information; or litigation, investigation, or regulatory action related to any of those, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our patient care, financial position, and results of operations and harm our business reputation.\nA compromise of our network security measures or other controls, or of those businesses or vendors with whom we interact, which results in confidential information being accessed, obtained, damaged or used by unauthorized persons or unavailability of systems necessary to the operation of our business, could impact patient care, harm our reputation, and expose us to significant remedial costs as well as regulatory actions (fines and penalties) and claims from patients, financial institutions, regulatory and law enforcement agencies, and other persons, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The nature of our business requires the sharing of protected health information and other sensitive information among employees and healthcare partners, many of whom carry\nand access portable devices outside of our physical locations, which in turn increases the risk of loss, theft or inadvertent disclosure of that information. Moreover, a security breach, or threat thereof, could require that we expend significant resources to repair or improve our information systems and infrastructure and could distract management and other key personnel from performing their primary operational duties. In the case of a material breach or cyber attack, the associated expenses and losses may exceed our current insurance coverage for such events. Some adverse consequences are not insurable, such as reputational harm and third-party business interruption. Failure to maintain proper function, security, or availability of our information systems or protect our data against unauthorized access could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nACE-IT is subject to a licensing, implementation, technology hosting, and support agreement with Cerner Corporation. Similarly, we have an agreement to license, host, and support a comprehensive home care management and clinical information system, Homecare HomebaseSM. In addition, we have a number of partners and non-software vendors with whom we share data in order to provide patient care and otherwise operate our business. In fact, federal laws and regulations require interoperability among healthcare entities in many circumstances. Our inability, or the inability of our partners or vendors, to continue to maintain and upgrade information systems, software, and hardware could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations, including affecting patient care. A security breach or other system failure involving Cerner, Homecare Homebase or another third-party with whom we share data or system connectivity could compromise our patient data or proprietary information or disrupt our ability to operate. In addition, costs, unexpected problems, and interruptions associated with the implementation or transition to new systems or technology or with adequate support of those systems or technology across numerous hospitals and agencies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe face intense competition for patients from other healthcare providers.\nWe operate in highly competitive, fragmented inpatient rehabilitation and home health and hospice industries. Although we are the nation\u2019s largest owner and operator of inpatient rehabilitation hospitals in terms of patients treated, revenues, and number of hospitals, in any particular market we may encounter competition from local or national entities with longer operating histories or other competitive advantages. For example, acute care hospitals, including those owned and operated by large public companies, may choose to expand or begin offering post-acute rehabilitation services. Given that approximately 91% of our hospitals\u2019 referrals come from acute care hospitals, that increase in competition could materially and adversely affect our admission referrals in the related markets. There are also large acute care systems that may have more resources available to compete than we have. Other providers of post-acute care services may attempt to become competitors in the future. For example, some nursing homes, including at least one public company operator, have been marketing themselves as offering certain rehabilitation services, even though nursing homes are not required to offer the same level of care, and are not licensed, as hospitals.\nIn the home health and hospice services industries, our primary competition comes from the home health business owned in part by a large insurance company, three other large public home health companies, locally owned private home health companies or acute care hospitals with adjunct home health services and typically varies from market to market. We also compete with a variety of other companies in providing home health and hospice services, some of which, including several large public companies, may have greater financial and other resources and may be more established in their respective communities. One public home health company has a strategy that emphasizes joint ventures with acute care hospitals, including a number of joint ventures with large systems, which frequently serve as the referral sources for home health patients in specific markets. Similarly, there is a large insurance company that offers Medicare Advantage coverage and owns an interest in a home health business that is the largest provider of Medicare-certified skilled home health services. Additionally, nursing homes compete for referrals in some instances when the patients may be suitable for home-based care.\nCompeting companies may offer newer or different services from those we offer or have better relationships with referring physicians and may thereby attract patients who are presently, or would be candidates for, receiving our inpatient rehabilitation, home health, or hospice services. The other public companies and the insurance companies have or may obtain significantly greater marketing and financial resources or other advantages of scale than we have or may obtain. Relatively few barriers to entry exist in most of our local markets. Accordingly, other companies, including hospitals and other healthcare organizations that are not currently providing competing services, may expand their services to include inpatient rehabilitation, home health, hospice care, community care, or similar services.\nThere can be no assurance this competition, or other competition which we may encounter in the future, will not adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In addition, from time to time, there are efforts in states with certificate of need (\u201cCON\u201d) laws to weaken those laws, which could potentially increase competition in those states. For example, in 2019, Florida enacted legislation to repeal CON regulations for several provider types, including IRFs, in two stages. Effective July 1, 2019, existing IRFs became eligible to expand without first obtaining a CON. Effective July 1, 2021, new IRFs can operate without first obtaining a CON. Conversely, competition and statutory procedural\nrequirements in some CON states may inhibit our ability to expand our operations in those states. For a breakdown of the CON status of the states and territories in which we have operations, see Item 2, Properties.\nIf we are unable to maintain or develop relationships with patient referral sources, our growth and profitability could be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in large part on referrals from physicians, hospitals, case managers and other patient referral sources in the communities we serve. By law, referral sources cannot be contractually obligated to refer patients to any specific provider. However, there can be no assurance that individuals will not attempt to steer patients to competing post-acute providers or otherwise limit our access to potential referrals. The establishment of joint ventures or networks between referral sources, such as acute care hospitals, and other post-acute providers may hinder patient referrals to us. The growing emphasis on integrated care delivery across the healthcare continuum increases that risk.\nOur growth and profitability depend on our ability to establish and maintain close working relationships with patient referral sources and to increase awareness and acceptance of the benefits of inpatient rehabilitation, home health, and hospice care by our referral sources and their patients. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to maintain our existing referral source relationships or that we will be able to develop and maintain new relationships in existing or new markets. Our loss of, or failure to maintain, existing relationships or our failure to develop new relationships could adversely affect our ability to grow our business and operate profitably.\nWe may have difficulty completing investments and transactions that increase our capacity consistent with our growth strategy.\nWe are selectively pursuing strategic acquisitions of, and in some instances joint ventures with, other healthcare providers. We may face limitations on our ability to identify sufficient acquisition or other development targets and to complete those transactions to meet goals. In the home health industry, there is significant competition among acquirors attempting to secure the acquisition of companies that have a large number of locations. Our large home health competitors may have the ability to out bid us for acquisitions. In the inpatient rehabilitation industry, the costs of constructing new hospitals may be increasing faster than the general inflation rate. In many states, the need to obtain governmental approvals, such as a CON or an approval of a change in ownership, may represent a significant obstacle to completing transactions. Additionally, in states with CON laws, it is not unusual for third-party providers to challenge the initial awards of CONs, the increase in the number of approved beds in an existing CON, or the expansion of the area served, and the adjudication of those challenges and related appeals may take many years. These factors may delay, or increase the cost to us associated with, any acquisition or de novo development or prevent us from completing one or more acquisitions or de novo developments.\nWe may make investments or complete transactions that could expose us to unforeseen risks and liabilities.\nInvestments, acquisitions, joint ventures or other development opportunities identified and completed may involve material cash expenditures, debt incurrence, operating losses, amortization of certain intangible assets of acquired companies, issuances of equity securities, liabilities, and expenses, some of which are unforeseen, that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity. Acquisitions, investments, and joint ventures involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022limitations, including state CONs as well as anti-trust, Medicare, and other regulatory approval requirements, on our ability to complete such acquisitions, particularly those involving not-for-profit providers, on terms, timetables, and valuations reasonable to us;\n\u2022limitations in obtaining financing for acquisitions at a cost reasonable to us;\n\u2022difficulties integrating acquired operations, personnel, and information systems, and in realizing projected revenues, efficiencies and cost savings, or returns on invested capital;\n\u2022entry into markets, businesses or services in which we may have little or no experience;\n\u2022diversion of business resources or management\u2019s attention from ongoing business operations; and\n\u2022exposure to undisclosed or unforeseen liabilities of acquired operations, including liabilities for failure to comply with healthcare laws and anti-trust considerations in specific markets as well as risks and liabilities related to previously compromised information systems.\nAs part of our development activities, we intend to build new, or de novo, inpatient rehabilitation hospitals. The construction of new hospitals involves numerous risks, including the receipt of all zoning and other regulatory approvals, such as a CON where necessary, construction delays and cost over-runs and unforeseen environmental liability exposure. Once built, new hospitals must undergo the state and Medicare certification process, the duration of which may be beyond our control. We may be unable to operate newly constructed hospitals as profitably as expected, and those hospitals may involve significant additional cash expenditures and operating expenses that could, in the aggregate, have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate acquisitions or realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions.\nWe may undertake strategic acquisitions from time to time. For example, we completed the acquisitions of the home health and hospice business of Camellia Heathcare and Alacare Home Health and Hospice in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Prior to consummation of any acquisition, the acquired business will have operated independently of us, with its own procedures, corporate culture, locations, employees and systems. We expect to integrate acquired businesses into our existing business utilizing certain common information systems, operating procedures, administrative functions, financial and internal controls and human resources practices to the extent practicable. There may be substantial difficulties, costs and delays involved in the integration of an acquired business with our business. Additionally, an acquisition could cause disruption to our business and operations and our relationships with customers, employees and other parties. In some cases, the acquired business has itself grown through acquisitions, and there may be legacy systems, operating policies and procedures, financial and administrative practices yet to be fully integrated. To the extent we are attempting to integrate multiple businesses at the same time, we may not be able to do so as efficiently or effectively as we initially anticipate. The failure to successfully integrate on a timely basis any acquired business with our existing business could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe anticipate our acquisitions will result in benefits including, among other things, increased revenues. However, acquired businesses may not contribute to our revenues or earnings to the extent anticipated, and any synergies we expect may not be realized after the acquisitions have been completed. If the acquired businesses underperform and any underperformance is other than temporary, we may be required to take an impairment charge. Failure to achieve the anticipated benefits could result in the diversion of management\u2019s time and energy and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nCompetition for staffing, shortages of qualified personnel, union activity or other factors may increase our labor costs and reduce profitability.\nOur operations are dependent on the efforts, abilities, and experience of our medical personnel, such as physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech pathologists, nurses, and other healthcare professionals. We compete with other healthcare providers in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel responsible for the daily operations of each of our locations. In some markets, the lack of availability of medical personnel is a significant operating issue facing all healthcare providers. This issue may be exacerbated if immigration is more limited in the future. As discussed above in the COVID-19 pandemic risk factor, the pandemic has affected the availability of clinical staff in many markets from time to time. A shortage may require us to continue to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain qualified personnel or to contract for more expensive temporary personnel. We also depend on the available labor pool of semi-skilled and unskilled employees in each of the markets in which we operate.\nIf our labor costs increase, we may not experience reimbursement rate or pricing increases to offset these additional costs. Because a significant percentage of our revenues consists of fixed, prospective payments, our ability to pass along increased labor costs is limited. In particular, if labor costs rise at an annual rate greater than our net annual market basket update from Medicare, as is expected to happen in 2021, or we experience a significant shift in our payor mix to lower rate payors such as Medicaid, our results of operations and cash flows will be adversely affected. Conversely, decreases in reimbursement revenues, such as with sequestration and the PDGM reimbursement rate reductions, may limit our ability to increase compensation or benefits to the extent necessary to retain key employees, in turn increasing our turnover and associated costs. Union activity is another factor that may contribute to increased labor costs. We currently have a minimal number of union employees, so an increase in labor union activity could have a significant impact on our labor costs. Our failure to recruit and retain qualified medical personnel, or to control our labor costs, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe are a defendant in various lawsuits, and may be subject to liability under qui tam cases, the outcome of which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry in which healthcare providers are routinely subject to litigation. As a result, various lawsuits, claims, and legal and regulatory proceedings have been and can be expected to be instituted or asserted against us. We are a defendant in a number of lawsuits, most of which are general and professional liability matters inherent in treating patients with medical conditions. Our more significant lawsuits and investigations, are discussed in Note 18, Contingencies and Other Commitments, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nSubstantial damages, fines, or other remedies assessed against us or agreed to in settlements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows, including indirectly as a result of the covenant defaults under our credit agreement or debt instruments or other claims such as those in securities actions. Additionally, the costs of defending litigation and investigations, even if frivolous or nonmeritorious, could be significant.\nThe FCA allows private citizens, called \u201crelators,\u201d to institute civil proceedings on behalf of the United States alleging violations of the FCA. These lawsuits, also known as \u201cwhistleblower\u201d or \u201cqui tam\u201d actions, can involve significant monetary damages, fines, attorneys\u2019 fees and the award of bounties to the relators who successfully prosecute or bring these suits to the government. Qui tam cases are sealed at the time of filing, which means knowledge of the information contained in the complaint typically is limited to the relator, the federal government, and the presiding court. The defendant in a qui tam action may remain unaware of the existence of a sealed complaint for years. While the complaint is under seal, the government reviews the merits of the case and may conduct a broad investigation and seek discovery from the defendant and other parties before deciding whether to intervene in the case and take the lead on litigating the claims. The court lifts the seal when the government makes its decision on whether to intervene. If the government decides not to intervene, the relator may elect to continue to pursue the lawsuit individually on behalf of the government.\nIn 2019, we settled with DOJ to conclude an investigation that originated in 2013 based on the allegations made by relators. The seven-year investigation produced no evidence of falsity or fraudulent conduct. Eventually, the court overseeing the qui tam actions refused to give DOJ more time to decide whether to intervene and unsealed the cases. DOJ chose not to intervene and prosecute the matter. We settled the DOJ investigation, together with the related qui tam or \u201cwhistleblower\u201d lawsuits, for a payment of $48 million, and we expressly denied any wrongdoing. Even when a matter is without merit, as we believe was the case with this investigation, we may still incur significant costs of defense or settlement costs or both.\nIt is possible that other qui tam lawsuits have been filed against us, which suits remain under seal, or that we are unaware of such filings or precluded by existing law or court order from discussing or disclosing the filing of such suits. We may be subject to liability under one or more undisclosed qui tam cases brought pursuant to the FCA.\nThe healthcare services we provide involve substantial risk of general and professional liability. Inpatient rehabilitative care involves three hours of daily intensive therapy for patients who are usually elderly and come to our hospitals with debilitating medical conditions, including COVID-19 and its associated conditions. Our clinicians must frequently assist patients who have difficulty with mobility. Home care services, by their very nature, are provided in an environment that is not in the substantial control of the healthcare provider. On any given day, we have thousands of care providers driving to and from the homes of patients. We cannot predict the impact any claims arising out of the travel, the home visits or the care being provided (regardless of their ultimate outcomes) could have on our business or reputation or on our ability to attract and retain patients and employees. We also cannot predict the adequacy of any reserves for such losses or recoveries from any insurance or re-insurance policies.\nWe self-insure a substantial portion of our professional, general, and workers\u2019 compensation liability risks, which may not include risks related to regulatory fines and penalties, through our captive insurance subsidiary, as discussed further in Note 11, Self-Insured Risks, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Changes in the number of these liability claims and the cost to resolve them impact the reserves for these risks. A variance between our estimated and actual number of claims or average cost per claim could have a material impact, either favorable or unfavorable, on the adequacy of the reserves for these liability risks, which could have an effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nAdditionally, we operate in states in which the litigation environment may pose a significant business risk to us. For instance, we have been involved in lawsuits, including putative class actions, brought under California\u2019s Private Attorneys General Act (\u201cPAGA\u201d). Under PAGA, individuals, including aggrieved employees, can bring individual or class-action claims alleging regulatory violations, including alleged violations of employment regulations. Additionally, judges and juries in California have demonstrated a willingness to grant large verdicts to plaintiffs in connection with employment and labor related cases. In 2017, the California Supreme Court held that plaintiffs bringing suit under PAGA are generally entitled to request and\nreceive a significant amount of information from the employer early in the litigation, which creates pressure for employers to settle early to avoid substantial litigation costs and which has resulted in a significant increase PAGA claims in recent years.\nWe may incur additional indebtedness in the future, and that debt or the associated increased leverage may have negative consequences for our business. The restrictive covenants included in the terms of our indebtedness could affect our ability to execute aspects of our business plan successfully.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have approximately $2.9 billion of long-term debt outstanding (including that portion of long-term debt classified as current and excluding $391.7 million in finance leases). See Note 10, Long-term Debt, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Subject to specified limitations, our credit agreement and the indentures governing our debt securities permit us and our subsidiaries to incur material additional debt. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the risks described here could intensify.\nOur indebtedness could have important consequences, including:\n\u2022limiting our ability to borrow additional amounts to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022making us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions, in government regulation and in our business by limiting our flexibility in planning for, and making it more difficult for us to react quickly to, changing conditions;\n\u2022placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared with competing providers that have less debt; and\n\u2022exposing us to risks inherent in interest rate fluctuations for outstanding amounts under our credit facility, which could result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in interest rates, as discussed in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\nWe are subject to contingent liabilities, prevailing economic conditions, and financial, business, and other factors beyond our control. Although we expect to make scheduled interest payments and principal reductions, we cannot provide assurance that changes in our business or other factors will not occur that may have the effect of preventing us from satisfying obligations under our credit agreement or debt instruments. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt and meet our other needs or have an unanticipated cash payment obligation, we may have to refinance all or a portion of our debt, obtain additional financing or reduce expenditures or sell assets we deem necessary to our business. We cannot provide assurance these measures would be possible or any additional financing could be obtained.\nIn addition, the terms of our credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes do, and our future debt instruments may, impose restrictions on us and our subsidiaries, including restrictions on our ability to, among other things, engage in one or more alternative separation transactions involving our home health and hospice segment (as discussed further above) or other transactions, pay dividends on or repurchase our capital stock, engage in transactions with affiliates, or incur or guarantee indebtedness. These covenants could also adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs and pursue available business opportunities. For additional discussion of our material debt covenants, see the \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section of Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Note 10, Long-term Debt, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nIn addition, our credit agreement requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests. See the \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section of Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Note 10, Long-term Debt, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Although we remained in compliance with the financial ratios and financial condition tests as of December 31, 2020, we cannot provide assurance we will continue to do so. Events beyond our control, including changes in general economic and business conditions, may affect our ability to meet those financial ratios and financial condition tests. A severe downturn in earnings, failure to realize anticipated earnings from acquisitions, or, if we have outstanding borrowings under our credit facility at the time, a rapid increase in interest rates could impair our ability to comply with those financial ratios and financial condition tests and we may need to obtain waivers from the required proportion of the lenders to avoid being in default. If we try to obtain a waiver or other relief from the required lenders, we may not be able to obtain it or such relief might have a material cost to us or be on terms less favorable than those in our existing debt. If a default occurs, the lenders could exercise their rights, including declaring all the funds borrowed (together with accrued and unpaid interest) to be immediately due and payable, terminating their commitments or instituting foreclosure proceedings against our assets, which, in turn, could cause the default and acceleration of the maturity of our other indebtedness. A breach of any other restrictive covenants\ncontained in our credit agreement or the indentures governing our senior notes would also (after giving effect to applicable grace periods, if any) result in an event of default with the same outcome.\nAs of December 31, 2020, approximately 72% of our consolidated Property and equipment, net was held by our company and its guarantor subsidiaries under its credit agreement. See Note 10, Long-term Debt, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section of Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Item 2, Properties.", "PERMNO": 10693, "SIC": 8060, "TIC": "EHC"}
