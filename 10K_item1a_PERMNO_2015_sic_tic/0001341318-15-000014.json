{"cik": "1341318", "company": "LAKE SHORE BANCORP, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nRisks Related To Our Business\nOur loan portfolio includes loans with a higher risk of loss. We originate commercial real estate loans, commercial business loans, consumer loans, and residential real estate loans (including home equity loans) primarily within our market area. Commercial real estate, commercial business, and consumer loans, which comprised in the aggregate 29.3% of our total loan portfolio at December 31, 2014, may expose a lender to greater credit risk than loans secured by residential real estate because the collateral securing these loans may not be sold as easily as residential real estate. In addition, commercial real estate and commercial business loans may also involve relatively large loan balances to individual borrowers or groups of borrowers. These loans also have greater credit risk than residential real estate for the following reasons:\n\u00b7\nCommercial Real Estate Loans. Repayment is dependent upon income being generated in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service.\n\u00b7\nCommercial Business Loans. Repayment is generally dependent upon the successful operation of the borrower\u2019s business.\n\u00b7\nConsumer Loans. Consumer loans (such as personal lines of credit) may or may not be collateralized with assets that provide an adequate source of payment for the loan due to depreciation, damage, or loss.\nDeterioration or minimal improvement in economic conditions in our market area could affect the performance of our loan portfolio. Higher prices for businesses and consumers and high unemployment could negatively affect our loan portfolio, if business owners or consumers are not able to make loan payments. As a result of the economic downturn in recent years, we have noticed an increase in our delinquent loans. Any further downturn in the real estate market or our national or local economy could adversely affect the value of the properties securing the loans or revenues from the borrower\u2019s business thereby increasing the risk of non-performing loans.\nIf our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings could decrease. Our loan customers may not repay their loans according to their terms and the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance. We therefore may experience significant loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. A downturn in the real estate market or the local economy could exacerbate this risk. We review our allowance for loan losses on a monthly basis to ensure that it is funded adequately to cover any anticipated losses.\nMaterial additions to our allowance for loan losses also would materially decrease our net income, and the charge-off of loans may cause us to increase the allowance for loan losses. Our provision for loan losses in 2014 was $222,000, a $117,000, or 111.4%, increase over 2013, partially due to an increase in the size of our commercial loan portfolio by $10.3 million from December 31, 2013 and increases in classified real estate and commercial loans. We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. We rely on our loan quality reviews, our experience and our evaluation of economic conditions, among other factors, in determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses. If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions to our allowance. The increased focus on commercial loan originations has been one of the more significant factors we have taken into account in evaluating our allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses. If we were to further increase the amount of commercial loans in our portfolio, we may decide to make increased provisions for loan losses. In addition, bank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nprovision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nLow demand for real estate loans may lower our profitability. Making loans secured by real estate, including one- to four-family and commercial real estate, is our primary business and primary source of revenue. If customer demand for real estate loans decreases, our profits may decrease because our alternative investments, primarily securities, generally earn less income than real estate loans. Customer demand for loans secured by real estate could be reduced due to weaker economic conditions, an increase in unemployment, a decrease in real estate values or an increase in interest rates. Interest rates on deposit products steadily declined between 2008 and 2012 at a greater pace than the rate decline on loan products, resulting in a positive net interest margin during that time period. Furthermore, we experienced commercial loan growth during 2010 through 2014, especially in the Erie County market area, which had a positive impact on net interest income. However, loan demand for retail customers slowed down during 2010 through 2014, which resulted in decreasing loan interest income. If rates begin to rise, loan demand may continue to be low, and deposit expenses may increase, which could lower our profitability.\nWe have opened new branches and expect to open additional new branches in the near future. Opening new branches reduces our short-term profitability due to one-time fixed expenses coupled with low levels of income earned by the branches until their customer bases are built. We opened a new branch in Snyder, New York during the second quarter of 2013. In addition, we may continue to expand through de novo branching. The expense associated with building and staffing new branches will significantly increase our non-interest expense, with compensation and occupancy costs constituting the largest amount of increased costs. Losses are expected from new branches for some time as the expenses associated with it are largely fixed and typically greater than the income earned as a branch builds up its customer base. Our management has projected that it will take approximately 24 to 36 months for new branches to become profitable after they have opened. There can be no assurance that our branch expansion strategy will result in increased earnings, or that it will result in increased earnings within a reasonable period of time. We expect that the success of our branching strategy will depend largely on the ability of our staff to market the deposit and loan products offered by us. The probability of opening a new branch will depend on available site locations, as well on the economic environment and projected demand in targeted market areas.\nThe results of our operations may be adversely affected if asset valuations cause other-than-temporary impairment charges. In 2013 and 2012, the Company determined that one private-label asset backed security was other than temporary impaired and had a non-cash, pre-tax, impairment charge of $180,000 and $102,000, respectively. We may be required to record future impairment charges on our investment securities or other assets if they suffer declines in value that are considered other-than-temporary. Numerous factors, including lack of liquidity for re-sales of certain investment securities, absence of reliable pricing information for investment securities, adverse changes in business climate, adverse actions by regulators, or unanticipated changes in the competitive environment could have a negative effect on our investment portfolio or other assets in future periods. If an impairment charge is significant enough it could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity, its ability to pay dividends to shareholders, and its regulatory capital ratios.\nChanges in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our results of operations and financial condition are significantly affected by changes in interest rates. We derive our income mainly from the difference or \u201cspread\u201d between the interest earned on loans, securities and other interest-earning assets and interest paid on deposits, borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. In general, the larger the spread, the more we earn. When market rates of interest change, the interest we receive on our assets and the interest we pay on our liabilities will fluctuate. This can cause decreases in our spread and can adversely affect our income.\nFrom an interest rate risk perspective, we have generally been liability sensitive, which indicates that our liabilities generally re-price faster than assets. In response to negative economic developments, the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s Open Market Committee steadily reduced its federal funds rate target and has continued to maintain the Fed Funds rate at 0.00%-0.25% for more than six years, which has had the effect of reducing our\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ncost of funds. Given our historic liability sensitivity, the decline in our cost of funds initially outpaced the decline in yield on our interest earning assets thereby having a positive impact on our net interest rate spread and net interest margin. However, in 2014, the rate of reduction in our cost of interest-bearing liabilities slowed in relation to the continuing decline in the yield on our interest-earning assets. Consequently, our net interest rate spread decreased by 13 basis points to 3.06% for the year ended December 31, 2014 from 3.19% for the year ended December 31, 2013. Our net interest margin declined 13 basis points to 3.21% for the year ended December 31, 2014 from 3.34% for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nWe continue to be at risk of additional reductions in our net interest rate spread and net interest margin resulting from further declines in our yield on interest earning assets that may outpace any subsequent reductions in our cost of funds. In particular, our ability to further reduce the cost of our interest-bearing deposits is increasingly limited given that most deposit offering rates are already well below 1.00% at December 31, 2014. Moreover, our liability sensitivity may adversely affect net income in the future when market interest rates ultimately increase from historical lows and our cost of interest-bearing liabilities rises faster than our yield on interest-earning assets.\nInterest rates also affect how much money we lend. For example, when interest rates rise, the cost of borrowing increases resulting in a decrease in loan demand. As rates rise, we expect loan applications to decrease, prepayment speeds on loans and mortgage-backed securities to slowdown and the interest rate on our loan portfolio to remain static. Therefore, in an increasing rate environment, our cost of funds is expected to increase more rapidly than the yields earned on our loan portfolio and securities portfolio. An increasing rate environment is expected to cause a decrease in our net interest rate spread and a decrease in our earnings.\nChanges in market interest rates could also reduce the value of our interest-earning assets including, but not limited to, our securities portfolio. In particular, the unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale are reported, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive income which is a component of stockholders\u2019 equity. As such, declines in the fair value of such securities resulting from increases in market interest rates may adversely affect stockholders\u2019 equity.\nIn order to mitigate the effect of a rising interest rate environment, the Bank\u2019s Asset-Liability Committee is continuing to review its options in relation to shortening the term of interest earning assets, increasing short term investments in liquid assets to take advantage of rising rates, increasing core deposit growth, implementation of new products, promotion of adjustable rate commercial loan products and use of derivative products.\nWe depend on our executive officers and key personnel to implement our business strategy and could be harmed by the loss of their services. We believe that our growth and future success will depend in large part upon the skills of our management team. The competition for qualified personnel in the financial services industry is intense, and the loss of our key personnel or an inability to continue to attract, retain and motivate key personnel could adversely affect our business. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our existing key personnel or attract additional qualified personnel. Although we have an employment agreement with our President and Chief Executive Officer, that contains a non-compete provision, the loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers and key personnel could impair our ability to continue to develop our business strategy.\nOur information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security. We rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer accounts, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems. There have been increasing efforts to breach data security at financial institutions through cyber attacks. Recently, there have been several instances involving financial services and consumer-based companies reporting the unauthorized disclosure of customer information or the destruction or theft of corporate data. We may be unable to proactively address these types of security breaches or to implement adequate preventative measures because the techniques used to cause these breaches change frequently, often are not recognized until launched against a target and may originate from less regulated and remote areas throughout the world. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\neffect of the possible failure, interruption or security breach of our information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failure, interruption or security breach will not occur or, if any does occur, that it will be adequately addressed. Additionally, we outsource our data processing to third parties. If the third party provider encounters difficulties or if we have difficulty in communicating with such third party, it will significantly affect our ability to adequately process and account for customer transactions, which would significantly affect our business operations. Furthermore, breaches of such third party\u2019s technology may also cause reimbursable loss to our consumer and business customers, through no fault of our own. Fraud attacks targeting customer-controlled devices, plastic payment card terminals, and merchant data collection points provide another source of potential loss, again through no fault of our own. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions or security breaches of information systems used to process customer transactions could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The Company maintains a system of internal controls to mitigate such occurrences and maintains insurance coverage for exposures that are insurable. The Company regularly tests internal controls to ensure that they are appropriate and functioning as designed.\nWe continually encounter technological change. The financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Our largest competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur ability to grow may be limited. We intend to seek to expand our banking franchise, organically and by acquiring other financial institutions or branches and other financial service providers if the right opportunity occurs. However, we have no specific plans for expansion or acquisitions at this time. Our ability to grow through selective acquisitions of other financial institutions or branches will depend on successfully identifying, acquiring and integrating those institutions or branches. We cannot assure you that we will be able to generate organic growth or identify attractive acquisition candidates, make acquisitions on favorable terms or successfully integrate any acquired institutions or branches.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, and, as a result, investors and depositors could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which could adversely affect our business, the trading price of our stock and our ability to attract additional deposits. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d) and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d), requires us to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting and provide an annual management report on our internal control over financial reporting, including, among other matters, management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. If we fail to identify and correct any significant deficiencies in the design or operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or fail to prevent fraud, current and potential shareholders and depositors could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, the trading price of our stock and our ability to attract additional deposits.\nOur risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risk and reducing the potential for significant losses. Our risk management framework is designed to minimize risk and loss to us. We seek to identify, measure, monitor, report and control our exposure to risk, including strategic, market, liquidity, compliance and operational risks. While we use a diverse set of risk monitoring and mitigation techniques, these techniques are inherently limited because they cannot anticipate the existence or future development of currently unanticipated or unknown risks. Recent economic conditions and heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny of the financial services industry, among other developments, have increased our level of\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nrisk. Accordingly, we could suffer losses as a result of our failure to properly anticipate and manage these risks.\nPublic Shareholders Do Not Exercise Voting Control Over Us.A majority of our voting stock is owned by Lake Shore, MHC. Lake Shore, MHC is controlled by its board of directors, who consist of those persons who are members of the board of directors of Lake Shore Bancorp and Lake Shore Savings. Lake Shore, MHC will determine the outcome of the election of the board of directors of Lake Shore Bancorp, and, as a general matter, controls the outcome of all matters presented to the shareholders of Lake Shore Bancorp for resolution by vote, except for matters that require a vote greater than Lake Shore, MHC\u2019s ownership interest. Consequently, Lake Shore, MHC, acting through its board of directors, is able to control the business and operations of Lake Shore Bancorp and may be able to prevent any challenge to the ownership or control of Lake Shore Bancorp by shareholders other than Lake Shore, MHC. There is no assurance that Lake Shore, MHC will not take actions that the public shareholders believe are against their interests.\nRisks Related To Recent Developments And The Banking Industry Generally\nFinancial reform legislation has, among other things, eliminated the Office of Thrift Supervision, tightened capital standards and created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and will result in new laws and regulations that are expected to increase our costs of operations. The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new rules and regulations, and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. The federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations, and consequently many of the details and much of the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act may not be known for many months or years.\nAmong other things, as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act:\n\u00b7\nthe OCC became the primary federal regulator for federal savings banks such as Lake Shore Savings (replacing the Office of Thrift Supervision), and the Federal Reserve Board now supervises and regulates all savings and loan holding companies that were formerly regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision, including the Company and the MHC;\n\u00b7\nthe federal prohibition on paying interest on commercial demand deposits has been eliminated, thus allowing businesses to have interest-bearing checking accounts. This change has increased our interest expense;\n\u00b7\nthe Federal Reserve Board is required to set minimum capital levels for depository institution holding companies that are as stringent as those required for their insured depository subsidiaries, and the components of Tier 1 capital are required to be restricted to capital instruments that are currently considered to be Tier 1 capital for insured depository institutions. The new capital rule for savings and loan holding companies will take effect on January 1, 2015. The Federal Reserve has proposed a new rule that would exempt certain savings and loan holding companies with less than $1.0 billion in assets. See \u201cSupervision and Regulation - Holding Company Regulation - Capital;\u201d\n\u00b7\nthe federal banking regulators are required to implement new leverage and capital requirements that take into account off-balance sheet activities and other risks, including risks relating to securitized products and derivatives;\n\u00b7\na new CFPB has been established, which has broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit \u201cunfair, deceptive or abusive\u201d acts and practices. The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. Banks and\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nsavings institutions with $10 billion or less in assets, like Lake Shore Savings, will be examined by their applicable bank regulators; and\n\u00b7\nfederal preemption rules that have been applicable for national banks and federal savings banks have been weakened, and state attorneys general have the ability to enforce federal consumer protection laws.\nIn addition to the risks noted above, we expect that our operating and compliance costs, and possibly our interest expense, will increase as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and the implementing rules and regulations. The need to comply with additional rules and regulations, as well as state laws and regulations to which we were not previously subject, will also divert management\u2019s time from managing our operations. Higher capital levels could reduce our ability to grow and decrease our interest-earning assets which would adversely affect our return on stockholders\u2019 equity.\nOur ability to pay dividends is subject to the ability of Lake Shore Savings to make capital distributions to Lake Shore Bancorp and the waiver of dividends by Lake Shore, MHC. The value of Lake Shore Bancorp\u2019s common stock is significantly affected by our ability to pay dividends to our public shareholders. Our long-term ability to pay dividends to our shareholders is based primarily upon the ability of the Bank to make capital distributions to Lake Shore Bancorp, and also to the availability of cash at the holding company level in the event earnings are not sufficient to pay dividends. Under OCC safe harbor regulations, the Bank may distribute to Lake Shore Bancorp capital in an amount not exceeding net income for the current calendar year and the prior two calendar years. Our ability to pay dividends and the amount of such dividends is also affected by the ability of Lake Shore, MHC, our mutual holding company and majority shareholder of Lake Shore Bancorp, to waive the receipt of dividends declared by Lake Shore Bancorp. Lake Shore, MHC waived its right to receive most of its dividends on its shares of Lake Shore Bancorp since its inception in 2006, with the exception of two dividends declared in 2012 and part of a dividend declared in 2011. The ability to waive dividends meant that Lake Shore Bancorp had more cash resources to pay dividends to its public shareholders than if Lake Shore, MHC accepted such dividends. Lake Shore, MHC is now required to obtain a waiver from the Federal Reserve Board allowing it to waive its right to dividends.\nThe Federal Reserve Board in 2011 issued regulations that govern the activities of Lake Shore Bancorp and Lake Shore, MHC and the regulations were implemented in the fourth quarter of 2011. Under Section 239.8(d) of the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s Regulation MM governing dividend waivers, a mutual holding company may waive its right to dividends on shares of its subsidiary if the mutual holding company gives written notice of the waiver to the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Board does not object. For a company such as Lake Shore, MHC, that was formed, issued stock and waived dividends prior to December 1, 2009, the Federal Reserve Board may not object to a dividend waiver if such waiver would not be detrimental to the safety and soundness of the savings bank subsidiary and the board of directors of the mutual holding company expressly determines that such dividend waiver is consistent with the board\u2019s fiduciary duties to the members of the mutual holding company. Regulation MM also requires as a condition to waiving dividends, that a mutual holding company obtain the approval of a majority of the eligible votes of its members within 12 months prior to the declaration of the dividend being waived.\nLake Shore, MHC solicited its members to vote on the proposal to waive dividends and on February 4, 2015, the members approved the waiver of dividends. The Board of Directors of Lake Shore, MHC subsequently approved a dividend waiver in accordance with the regulations and submitted it to the Federal Reserve Board for their non-objection. As of March 3, 2015, Lake Shore, MHC received the non-objection of the Federal Reserve Board to waive its right to receive dividends paid by the Company during the twelve months ending February 3, 2016. It is expected that Lake Shore, MHC will continue to waive future dividends, except to the extent dividends are needed to fund Lake Shore, MHC\u2019s continuing operations, subject to the ability of Lake Shore, MHC to obtain regulatory approval of its requests to waive dividends and its ability to obtain future member approval of dividend waivers.\nWhile Lake Shore, MHC is grandfathered for purposes of the dividend waiver provisions of Regulation MM and has complied with all additional requirements imposed, we cannot predict whether the\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nFederal Reserve Board will grant a dividend waiver request and, if granted, there can be no assurance as to the conditions, if any, the Federal Reserve Board will place on future dividend waiver requests by grandfathered mutual holding companies such as Lake Shore, MHC. If Lake Shore, MHC is unable to waive the receipt of dividends, our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders may be substantially impaired and the amounts of any such dividends may be significantly reduced.\nWe will become subject to more stringent capital requirements, which may adversely impact our return on equity, require us to raise additional capital or constrain us from paying dividends or repurchasing shares. In July 2013, the federal banking agencies approved a new rule that substantially amends the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to us. The final rule implements the \u201cBasel III\u201d regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act.\nThe final rule includes new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which will be effective for Lake Shore Savings on January 1, 2015 and refines the definition of what constitutes \u201ccapital\u201d for purposes of calculating these ratios. The new minimum capital requirements will be: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); (iii) a total capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from current rules); and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. The final rule also established a \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d of 2.5%, and will result in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The new capital conservation buffer requirement would be phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and would increase each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such actions.\nThe application of more stringent capital requirements for Lake Shore Savings could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, require the raising of additional capital, and result in regulatory actions such as the inability to pay dividends or repurchase shares if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements.\nNew regulations could restrict our ability to originate and sell mortgage loans. The CFPB has issued a rule designed to clarify for lenders how they can avoid monetary damages under the Dodd-Frank Act, which would hold lenders accountable for ensuring a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a mortgage. Loans that meet this \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d definition will be presumed to have complied with the new ability-to-repay standard.\nUnder the CFPB\u2019s rule, a \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d loan must not contain certain specified features, including:\n\u00b7\nexcessive upfront points and fees (those exceeding 3% of the total loan amount, less \u201cbona fide discount points\u201d for prime loans);\n\u00b7\ninterest-only payments;\n\u00b7\nnegative-amortization; and\n\u00b7\nterms longer than 30 years.\nAlso, to qualify as a \u201cqualified mortgage,\u201d a borrower\u2019s total monthly debt-to-income ratio may not exceed 43%. Lenders must also verify and document the income and financial resources relied upon to qualify the borrower for the loan and underwrite the loan based on a fully amortizing payment schedule and maximum interest rate during the first five years, taking into account all applicable taxes, insurance and assessments. The CFPB\u2019s rule on qualified mortgages could limit our ability or desire to make certain types of loans or loans to certain borrowers, or could make it more expensive/and or time consuming to make these loans, which could limit our growth or profitability.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nNegative developments in the financial industry and the credit markets may subject us to additional regulation. As a result of the recent global financial crisis, the potential exists for new federal or state laws and regulations regarding lending and funding practices and liquidity standards to be promulgated, and bank regulatory agencies are expected to be active in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations, including the expected issuance of many formal enforcement orders. Negative developments in the financial industry and credit markets, and the impact of new legislation in response to those developments, may negatively impact our operations by restricting our business operations, including our ability to originate or sell loans, and may adversely impact our financial performance.\nOur local economy may affect our future growth possibilities. Our success significantly depends upon the growth in population, income levels, deposits and housing starts in our current market area, which is primarily located in Chautauqua County, New York and Erie County, New York. Unlike many larger institutions, we are not able to spread the risks of unfavorable local economic conditions across a large number of diversified economies and geographic locations. If the communities in which we operate do not grow, or if prevailing economic conditions locally or nationally are unfavorable, our business may be negatively affected. A weak economy could lead to a deterioration of the credit quality of our loan portfolio and reduce our level of customer deposits, which in turn would hurt our business. Moreover, the value of real estate or other collateral that may secure our loans could be adversely affected.\nCompetition in our primary market area may reduce our ability to attract and retain deposits and originate loans. We operate in a competitive market for both attracting deposits, which is our primary source of funds, and originating loans. Historically, our most direct competition for savings deposits has come from credit unions, community banks, large commercial banks and thrift institutions in our primary market area. Particularly in times of extremely low or extremely high interest rates, we have faced additional significant competition for depositors from brokerage firms and other firms\u2019 short-term money market securities and corporate and government securities. Our competition for loans comes principally from mortgage brokers, commercial banks, other thrift institutions, and insurance companies. Competition for loan originations and deposits may limit our future growth and earnings prospects.\nChanges in the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s monetary or fiscal policies could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our earnings will be affected by domestic economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government and its agencies. The Federal Reserve Board has, and is likely to continue to have, an important impact on the operating results of banks through its power to implement national monetary policy, among other things, in order to curb inflation or combat a recession. The Federal Reserve Board affects the levels of bank loans, investments and deposits through its control over the issuance of United States government securities, its regulation of the discount rate applicable to member banks and its influence over reserve requirements to which member banks are subject. We cannot predict the nature or impact of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies.", "PERMNO": 91176, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "LSBK"}
