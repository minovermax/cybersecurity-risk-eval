{"cik": "1397047", "company": "FlexShopper, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors, in addition to the other information presented in this Form 10-K, in evaluating us and our business. Any of the following risks, as well as other risks and uncertainties, could harm our business and financial results and cause the value of our securities to decline.\nRisks Related to Our Business, Operations and Technology\nOur business liquidity and capital resources are dependent upon our Credit Agreement with an institutional lender and our compliance with the terms of that agreement. FlexShopper, through FlexShopper 2, LLC (the \u201cBorrower\u201d), is party to a credit agreement (as amended, the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, various lenders from time to time party thereto and WE2014-1, LLC (the \u201cLender\u201d). Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, the Borrower may borrow up to $57,500,000 from the Lender, based on the Borrower\u2019s cash on hand and Amortized Order Value of its Eligible Leases (as such terms are defined in the Credit Agreement). The Commitment Termination Date of the Credit Agreement is April 1, 2024. The Lender was granted a security interest in certain leases as collateral under the Credit Agreement and the interest rate charged on amounts borrowed was set at LIBOR plus 11% per annum. As of March 30, 2022, there was $965,995 in additional availability under the Credit Agreement and the outstanding balance under the Credit Agreement was $56,500,000.\nFailure to effectively manage our costs could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. Certain elements of our cost structure are largely fixed in nature while consumer spending remains uncertain, which makes it challenging for us to maintain or increase our operating income. The competitiveness in our industry and increasing price transparency mean that the need to achieve efficient operations is greater than ever. As a result, we must continuously focus on managing our cost structure. Failure to manage our labor and benefit rates, advertising and marketing expenses, operating leases, charge-offs or indirect spending could materially adversely affect our profitability.\nOur LTO business depends on the success of our third-party retail partners and our continued relationships with them. Our revenues depend in part on the relationships we have with third-party retailers we work with to offer our LTO services. We have entered into a variety of such arrangements and expect to seek additional such relationships in the future. If our retail partners do not satisfy their obligations to us, we are unable to meet our retail partners\u2019 expectations and demands or we are unable to reach agreements with additional suitable retail partners, we may fail to meet our business objectives. The terms of any additional retail partnerships or other strategic arrangements that we establish may not be favorable to us. Our inability to successfully implement retail partnerships and strategic arrangements could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, in most cases, our agreements with such third-party retailers may be terminated at the retailer\u2019s election. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue our relationships with our retail partners on the same or more favorable terms in future periods or that these relationships will continue beyond the terms of our existing contracts with our retail partners. The failure of our third-party retail partners to maintain quality and consistency in their operations and their ability to continue to provide products and services, or the loss of the relationship with any of these third-party retailers and an inability to replace them, could cause our business to lose customers, substantially decreasing our revenues and earnings growth.\nOur customer base presents significant risk of default for non-payment. We bear the risk of non-payment or late payments by our customers. The nature of our customer base makes it sensitive to adverse economic conditions and, in the event of an economic downturn, less likely to meet our prevailing underwriting standards, which may be more restrictive in an adverse economic environment. As a result, during such periods we may experience decreases in the growth of new customers, and we may curtail spending limits to existing customers, which may adversely affect our net revenue and potential profitability.\nOur growth will depend on our ability to develop our brands, and these efforts may be costly. Our ability to develop the FlexShopper brand will be critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our services and will require a continued focus on active marketing efforts. We will need to continue to spend substantial amounts of money on, and devote substantial resources to, advertising, marketing, and other efforts to create and maintain brand loyalty among our customers. If we fail to promote and maintain our brand, or if we incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to do so, our business would be harmed.\nOur LTO business depends on the continued growth of online and mobile commerce. The business of selling goods over the internet and mobile networks is dynamic and relatively new. Concerns about fraud, privacy and other problems or lack of access may discourage additional consumers from adopting the internet or mobile devices as modes of commerce or may prompt consumers to offline channels. In order to expand our user base, we must appeal to and acquire consumers who historically have used traditional means of commerce to purchase goods and may prefer internet analogues to such traditional retail means, such as the retailer\u2019s own website, to our offerings. If these consumers prove to be less active than we expect due to lower levels of willingness or ability to use the internet or mobile devices for commerce for any reason, including lack of access to high-speed communications equipment, traffic congestion on the internet or mobile network outages or delays, disruptions or other damage to users\u2019 computers or mobile devices, and we are unable to gain efficiencies in our operating costs, including our cost of acquiring new users, our business could be adversely impacted.\nFailure to successfully manage and grow our FlexShopper.com e-commerce platform could materially adversely affect our business and prospects. Our FlexShopper.com e-commerce platform provides customers the ability to apply, shop, review our product offerings and prices and enter into lease agreements as well as make payments on existing leases from the comfort of their homes and on their mobile devices. Our e-commerce platform is a significant and essential component of our strategic plan and we believe will drive future growth of our business. In order to promote our products and services and allow customers to transact online and reach new customers, we must effectively maintain, improve and grow our e-commerce platform. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain, improve or grow our e-commerce platform in a profitable manner.\nThe success of our business is dependent on factors affecting consumer spending that are not under our control. Consumer spending is affected by general economic conditions and other factors including levels of employment, disposable consumer income, prevailing interest rates, consumer debt and availability of credit, inflation, recession and fears of recession, tax rates and rate increases, timing of receipt of tax refunds, consumer confidence in future economic conditions and political conditions, and consumer perceptions of personal well-being and security. Unfavorable changes in factors affecting discretionary spending could reduce demand for our products and services, such as consumer electronics and residential furniture, resulting in lower revenue and negatively impacting our business and its financial results.\nOur customers can return merchandise without penalty. When our customers acquire merchandise through the FlexShopper LTO program, we purchase the merchandise from the retailer and enter the lease-to-own relationship with the customer. Because our customers can return merchandise without penalty, there is risk that we may end up owning a significant amount of merchandise that is difficult to monetize. While we have factored customer returns into our business model, customer return volume may exceed the levels we expect, which could adversely impact our collections, revenues and our financial performance. Returns totalled less than 3% of leased merchandise for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nWe rely on third-party credit/debit card and ACH (automated clearing house) processors to process collections from customers on a weekly basis. Our ability to collect from customers could be impaired if these processors do not work with us. These third-party payment processors may consider our business a high risk since our customer base has a high incidence of insufficient funds and rejected payments. This could cause a processor to discontinue its services to us, and we may not be able to find a replacement processor. If this occurs, we would have to collect from our customers using less efficient methods, which would adversely impact our collections, revenues and our financial performance.\nWe rely on internal models to manage risk, to provide accounting estimates and to make other business decisions. Our results could be adversely affected if those models do not provide reliable estimates or predictions of future activity. The accurate modeling of risks is critical to our business, particularly with respect to managing underwriting and spending limits for our customers. Our expectations regarding customer repayment levels, as well as our allowances for doubtful accounts and other accounting estimates, are based in large part on internal modeling. We also rely heavily on internal models in making a variety of other decisions crucial to the successful operation of our business. It is therefore important that our models are accurate, and any failure in this regard could have a material adverse effect on our results. However, models are inherently imperfect predictors of actual results because they are based on historical data available to us and our assumptions about factors such as demand, payment rates, default rates, delinquency rates and other factors that may overstate or understate future experience. Our models could produce unreliable results for a number of reasons, including the limitations or lack of historical data to predict results, invalid or incorrect underlying assumptions or data, the need for manual adjustments in response to rapid changes in economic conditions, incorrect coding of the models or inappropriate application of a model to products or events outside of the model\u2019s intended use. In particular, models are less dependable when the economic environment is outside of historical experience, as has been the case recently. Due to the factors described above, resulting unanticipated and excessive default and charge-off experience can adversely affect our profitability and financial condition, breach covenants in our Credit Agreement, limit our ability to secure a future credit facility and adversely affect our ability to finance our business.\nIn deciding whether to provide a spending limit to customers, we rely on the accuracy and completeness of information furnished to us by or on behalf of our customers. If we and our systems are unable to detect any misrepresentations in this information, this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In deciding whether to provide a customer with a spending amount, we rely heavily on information furnished to us by or on behalf of our customers and our ability to validate such information through third-party services, including personal financial information. If a significant percentage of our customers intentionally or negligently misrepresent any of this information, and we or our systems do not or did not detect such misrepresentations, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to effectively manage our risk, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have substantial investment in the creditworthiness and financial condition of our customers. One of the largest current assets on our balance sheet is the accounts receivable balance from our customers. Deterioration in the financial condition of a significant component of our customer base could hinder our ability to collect amounts due from our customers. Potential causes of such declines include national or local economic downturns, inflation, pandemics, reduction in government subsidies and consumer confidence declines.\nIf we fail to timely contact delinquent customers, then the number of delinquent customer receivables eventually being charged off could increase. We contact customers with delinquent account balances soon after the account becomes delinquent. During periods of increased delinquencies, it is important that we are proactive in dealing with these customers rather than simply allowing customer receivables to go to charge-off. During periods of increased delinquencies, it becomes extremely important that we are properly staffed and trained to assist customers in bringing the delinquent balance current and ultimately avoiding charge-off. If we do not properly staff and train our collections personnel, or if we incur any downtime or other issues with our information systems that assist us with our collection efforts, then the number of accounts in a delinquent status or charged-off could increase. In addition, managing a substantially higher volume of delinquent customer receivables typically increases our operational costs. A rise in delinquencies or charge-offs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nOur operations are regulated by and subject to the requirements of various Federal and state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations, which may be amended or supplemented or interpreted by courts from time to time, could expose us to significant compliance costs or burdens or force us to change our business practices in a manner that may be materially adverse to our operations, prospects or financial condition. Currently, nearly every state and the District of Columbia specifically regulate LTO transactions. At the present time, no federal law specifically regulates the LTO industry, although federal legislation to regulate the industry has been proposed from time to time. Any adverse changes in existing laws, or the passage of new adverse legislation by states or the Federal government could materially increase both our costs of complying with laws and the risk that we could be sued or be subject to government sanctions if we are not in compliance. In addition, new burdensome legislation might force us to change our business model and might reduce the economic potential of our sales and lease ownership operations. Most of the states that regulate LTO transactions have enacted disclosure laws that require LTO companies to disclose to their customers the total number of payments, the total amount and timing of all payments to acquire ownership of any item, any other charges that may be imposed and miscellaneous other items. In addition, certain restrictive state lease purchase laws limit the total amount that a customer may be charged for an item or regulate the \u201ccost-of-rental\u201d amount that LTO companies may charge on LTO transactions, generally defining \u201ccost-of-rental\u201d as lease fees paid in excess of the \u201cretail\u201d price of the goods. There has been increased legislative attention in the United States, at both the Federal and state levels, on consumer debt transactions in general, which may result in an increase in legislative regulatory efforts directed at the LTO industry. We cannot guarantee that the Federal government or states will not enact additional or different legislation that would be disadvantageous or otherwise materially adverse to us. In addition to the risk of lawsuits related to the laws that regulate LTO transactions, we could be subject to lawsuits alleging violations of Federal and/or state laws and regulations relating to consumer tort law, including fraud, consumer protection, information security and privacy. A large judgment against us could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, an adverse outcome from a lawsuit, even one against one of our competitors, could result in changes in the way we and others in the industry do business, possibly leading to significant costs or decreased revenues or profitability.\nOur virtual LTO business differs in some potentially significant respects from the risks of a typical LTO brick-and-mortar store business, which implies certain additional regulatory risks. We offer LTO products directly to consumers through our e-commerce marketplace and through the stores and e-commerce sites of third-party retailers. This novel business model implicates certain regulatory risk including, among others:\n\u25cf possibly different regulatory risks than applicable to traditional brick-and-mortar LTO stores, whether arising from the offer by third-party retailers of FlexShopper\u2019s B2B solutions alongside traditional cash, check or credit payment options or otherwise, including the risk that regulators may mistakenly treat virtual LTO transactions as some other type of transaction that would face different and more burdensome and complex regulations;\n\u25cf reliance on automatic bank account drafts for lease payments, which may become disfavored as a payment method for these transactions by regulators;\n\u25cf potential that regulators may target the virtual LTO transaction and/or adopt new regulations or legislation (or existing laws and regulations may be interpreted in a manner) that negatively impact FlexShopper\u2019s ability to offer virtual LTO programs through third-party retail partners;\n\u25cf potential that regulators may attempt to force the application of laws and regulations on FlexShopper\u2019s virtual LTO business in inconsistent and unpredictable ways that could increase the compliance-related costs incurred by FlexShopper, and negatively impact FlexShopper\u2019s financial and operational performance; and\n\u25cf indemnification obligations to FlexShopper retail partners and their service providers for losses stemming from FlexShopper\u2019s failure to perform with respect to its products and services.\nAny of these risks could have a material adverse effect on FlexShopper\u2019s business.\nChanges in regulations or customer concerns, in particular as they relate to privacy and protection of customer data, could adversely affect our business. Our business is subject to laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personally identifiable information about our customers. The interpretation and application of privacy and customer data protection laws are in a state of flux and may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. These laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently, and our current data protection policies and practices may not be consistent with those interpretations and applications. Complying with these varying requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our own privacy policies or with any regulatory requirements or orders or other privacy or consumer protection related laws and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity and adversely affect our operating results.\nThe transactions offered to consumers by our businesses may be negatively characterized by consumer advocacy groups, the media and certain Federal, state and local government officials, and if those negative characterizations become increasingly accepted by consumers and/or FlexShopper\u2019s retail partners, demand for our goods and the transactions we offer could decrease and our business could be materially adversely affected. Certain consumer advocacy groups, media reports and federal and state legislators have asserted that laws and regulations should be broader and more restrictive regarding LTO transactions. The consumer advocacy groups and media reports generally focus on the total cost to a consumer to acquire an item, which is often alleged to be higher than the interest typically charged by banks or similar lending institutions to consumers with better credit histories. This \u201ccost-of-rental\u201d amount, which is generally defined as lease fees paid in excess of the \u201cretail\u201d price of the goods, is from time to time characterized by consumer advocacy groups and media reports as predatory or abusive without discussing benefits associated with LTO programs or the lack of viable alternatives for our customers\u2019 needs. If the negative characterization of these types of LTO transactions becomes increasingly accepted by consumers or FlexShopper\u2019s retail and merchant partners, demand for our products and services could significantly decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, if the negative characterization of these types of transactions is accepted by legislators and regulators, we could become subject to more restrictive laws and regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The vast expansion and reach of technology, including social media platforms, has increased the risk that our reputation could be significantly impacted by these negative characterizations in a relatively short amount of time. If we are unable to quickly and effectively respond to such characterizations, we may experience declines in customer loyalty and traffic and our relationships with our retail partners may suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe loss of any of our key personnel could harm our business. Our future financial performance will depend to a significant extent on our ability to motivate and retain key management personnel. Competition for qualified management personnel is intense, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to hire additional qualified management on terms satisfactory to us. Further, in the event we experience turnover in our senior management positions, we cannot assure you that we will be able to recruit suitable replacements. We must also successfully integrate all new management and other key positions within our organization to achieve our operating objectives. Even if we are successful, turnover in key management positions may temporarily harm our financial performance and results of operations until new management becomes familiar with our business. At present, we do not maintain key-man life insurance on any of our executive officers. Although we have entered employment contracts with Richard House, Jr., our Chief Executive Officer and H. Russell Heiser, Jr., our Chief Financial Officer, we cannot guarantee that they will be available. Our Board of Directors is responsible for approval of all future employment contracts with our executive officers. We can provide no assurances that said future employment contracts and/or their current compensation is or will be on commercially reasonable terms to us in order to retain our key personnel. The loss of any of our key personnel could harm our business.\nWe depend on hiring an adequate number of hourly employees to run our business and are subject to government regulations concerning these and our other employees, including wage and hour regulations. Our workforce has a significant portion of employees who work on an hourly basis. To grow our operations and meet the needs and expectations of our customers, we must attract, train, and retain a large number of hourly associates, while at the same time controlling labor costs. These positions have historically had high turnover rates, which can lead to increased training, retention and other costs. In certain areas where we operate, there is significant competition for employees, including from retailers and the restaurant industries. The lack of availability of an adequate number of hourly employees, or our inability to attract and retain them, or an increase in wages and benefits to current employees could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. We are subject to applicable rules and regulations relating to our relationship with our employees, including wage and hour regulations, health benefits, unemployment and payroll taxes, overtime and working conditions and immigration status. Accordingly, federal, state or local legislated increases in the minimum wage, as well as increases in additional labor cost components such as employee benefit costs, workers\u2019 compensation insurance rates, compliance costs and fines, would increase our labor costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nEmployee misconduct or misconduct by third parties acting on our behalf could harm us by subjecting us to monetary loss, significant legal liability, regulatory scrutiny and reputational harm. Our reputation is critical to maintaining and developing relationships with our existing and potential customers and third parties with whom we do business. There is a risk that our employees or the employees of a third-party retailer with whom we partner could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our reputation and business. For example, if an employee or a third party associated with our business were to engage in, or be accused of engaging in, illegal or suspicious activities including fraud or theft of our customers\u2019 information, we could suffer direct losses from the activity and, in addition, we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial condition, customer relationships and ability to attract future customers. Employee or third-party misconduct could prompt regulators to allege or to determine based upon such misconduct that we have not established adequate supervisory systems and procedures to inform employees of applicable rules or to detect violations of such rules. The precautions that we take to detect and prevent misconduct may not be effective in all cases. Misconduct by our employees or third-party contractors, or even unsubstantiated allegations of misconduct, could result in a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business. Our operations are subject to certain laws generally prohibiting companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions. Our employees, contractors or agents may violate the policies and procedures we have implemented to ensure compliance with these laws. Any such improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, and related shareholder lawsuits, could cause us to incur significant legal fees, and could damage our reputation.\nCompetition in the LTO business is intense. The LTO industry is highly competitive. Our operation competes with other national, regional and local LTO businesses, as well as with rental stores that do not offer their customers a purchase option. Some of these companies have, or may develop, systems that enable consumers to obtain through online facilities spending limits and payment terms and to enter into leases in a manner similar to that provided by our proprietary technology. Greater financial resources may allow our competitors to grow faster than us, including through acquisitions. This in turn may enable them to enter new markets before we can, which may decrease our opportunities in those markets. Greater name recognition, or better public perception of a competitor\u2019s reputation, may help them divert market share away from us, even in our established markets. Some competitors may be willing to offer competing products on an unprofitable basis in an effort to gain market share, which could compel us to match their pricing strategy or lose business. With respect to customers desiring to purchase merchandise for cash or on credit, we also compete with retail stores. Competition is based primarily on store location, product selection and availability, customer service and lease rates and terms. We believe we do not currently have significant competition for our online LTO marketplace and patent pending LTO payment method. However, such competition is likely to develop over time, and we may be unable to successfully compete in our target markets. We can provide no assurances that we will be able to successfully compete in the LTO industry.\nContinuation or worsening of current economic conditions faced by a portion of our customer base could result in decreased revenues. The geographic concentration of our retail partners may magnify the impact of conditions in a particular region, including economic downturns and other occurrences. Although we believe an economic downturn can result in increased business in the LTO market as consumers increasingly find it difficult to purchase home furnishings, electronics and appliances from traditional retailers on store installment credit, it is possible that if the conditions continue for a significant period, or get worse, consumers may curtail spending on all or some of the types of merchandise we offer, in which event our revenues may suffer.\nMuch of our customer base continues to experience prolonged economic uncertainty and, in certain areas, unfavorable economic conditions. We believe that the extended duration of that economic uncertainty and unfavorable economic conditions may be resulting in our customers curtailing purchases of the types of merchandise we offer, or entering into agreements that generate smaller amounts of revenue for us (i.e., a 90-day same-as-cash option), resulting in decreased revenues for us. Any increases in unemployment or underemployment within our customer base may result in increased defaults on lease payments, resulting in increased merchandise return costs and merchandise losses. In addition, our retail partners as well as our online customer base are subject to the effects of adverse acts of nature, such as winter storms, hurricanes, hail storms, strong winds, earthquakes and tornadoes, which have in the past caused damage such as flooding and other damage to our retail partners and online customers.\nWe are subject to sales, income and other taxes, which can be difficult and complex to calculate due to the nature of our business. A failure to correctly calculate and pay such taxes could result in substantial tax liabilities and a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The application of indirect taxes, such as sales tax, is a complex and evolving issue, particularly with respect to the LTO industry generally and our virtual LTO business more specifically. Many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the growth of the LTO industry and e-commerce and, therefore, in many cases it is not clear how existing statutes apply to our various businesses. In addition, governments are increasingly looking for ways to increase revenues, which has resulted in discussions about tax reform and other legislative action to increase tax revenues, including through indirect taxes. This also could result in other adverse changes in or interpretations of existing sales, income and other tax regulations. For example, from time to time, some taxing authorities in the United States have notified us that they believe we owe them certain taxes imposed on transactions with our customers. Although these notifications have not resulted in material tax liabilities to date, there is a risk that one or more jurisdictions may be successful in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nSystem interruption and the lack of integration and redundancy in our order entry and online systems may adversely affect our net sales. Customer access to our customer service center and websites is key to the continued flow of new orders. Anything that would hamper or interrupt such access could adversely affect our net sales, operating results and customer satisfaction. Examples of risks that could affect access include problems with the internet or telecommunication infrastructure, limited web access by our customers, local or more systemic impairment of computer systems due to viruses or malware, or impaired access due to breaches of internet security or denial of service attacks. Changes in the policies of service providers or others that increase the cost of telephone or internet access could inhibit our ability to market our products or transact orders with customers. In addition, our ability to operate our business from day-to-day largely depends on the efficient operation of our computer hardware and software systems and communications systems. Our computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, earthquakes, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins or denial of service attacks, improper operation by employees and similar events or disruptions. Any of these events could cause system interruption, delays and loss of critical data and could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling customer orders and providing services, which would impair our operations. Certain of our systems are not redundant, and we have not fully implemented a disaster recovery plan. In addition, we may have inadequate insurance coverage to compensate us for any related losses. Interruptions to customer ordering, particularly if prolonged, could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy and have significant adverse effects on our financial results.\nWe face risks related to the strength of our operational, technological and organizational infrastructure. We are exposed to operational risks that can be manifested in many ways, such as errors related to failed or inadequate processes, faulty or disabled computer systems, fraud by employees, contractors or third parties and exposure to external events. In addition, we are heavily dependent on the strength and capability of our technology systems that we use to manage our internal financial, credit and other systems, interface with our customers and develop and implement effective marketing campaigns. Our ability to operate our business to meet the needs of our existing customers and attract new ones and to run our business in compliance with applicable laws and regulations depends on the functionality of our operational and technology systems. Any disruptions or failures of our operational and technology systems, including those associated with improvements or modifications to such systems, could cause us to be unable to market and manage our products and services and to report our financial results in a timely and accurate manner, all of which could have a negative impact on our results of operations. In some cases, we outsource delivery, maintenance and development of our operational and technological functionality to third parties. These third parties may experience errors or disruptions that could adversely impact us and over which we may have limited control. Any increase in the amount of our infrastructure that we outsource to third parties may increase our exposure to these risks.\nIf we do not respond to technological changes, our services could become obsolete, and we could lose customers. To remain competitive, we must continue to enhance and improve the functionality and features of our e-commerce websites and other technologies. We may face material delays in introducing new products and enhancements. If this happens, our customers may forego the use of our websites and use those of our competitors. The internet and the online commerce industry are rapidly changing. If competitors introduce new products and services using new technologies or if new industry standards and practices emerge, our existing websites and our proprietary technology and systems may become obsolete. Our failure to respond to technological change or to adequately maintain, upgrade and develop our computer network and the systems used to process customers\u2019 orders and payments could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties. We have been granted a patent for our system that enables e-commerce servers to complete LTO transactions through their e-commerce websites and for additional systems that enable retailer devices to complete LTO transactions through their retailer web pages, as well as systems that further enable consumer devices to modify received retailer web pages to indicate LTO payments in association with transaction-eligible products as part of LTO transactions through the retailer web pages. However, we can provide no assurances that we will be granted any additional patents by the USPTO. We believe certain proprietary information, including but not limited to our underwriting model, and patented and patent-pending systems are central to our business model, and we believe give us a key competitive advantage. We rely on trademark and copyright law, trade secret protection, and confidentiality, license and work product agreements with our employees, customers and others to protect our proprietary rights. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring trademarks, service marks and domain names that are similar to, infringe upon, or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights. Failure to protect our domain names could affect adversely our reputation and brand and make it more difficult for users to find our website. We may be unable to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. The protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. In addition, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or prevent parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights. We can be at risk that others will independently develop or acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights. The use of our technology or similar technology by others could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed, cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business. We cannot be certain that the intellectual property used in our business does not and will not infringe the intellectual property rights of others, and we are from time to time subject to third party infringement claims. Due to changes in patent law, we face the risk of a temporary increase in patent litigation due to new restrictions on including unrelated defendants in patent infringement lawsuits in the future particularly from entities that own patents but that do not make products or services covered by the patents. Any third-party infringement claims against us, whether or not meritorious, may result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources, injunctions against us or the payment of damages. Moreover, should we be found liable for infringement, we may be required to seek to enter into licensing agreements, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nProduct safety and quality control issues, including product recalls, could harm our reputation, divert resources, reduce sales and increase costs. The products we lease are subject to regulation by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and similar state regulatory authorities. Such products could be subject to recalls and other actions by these authorities. Product safety or quality concerns may require us to voluntarily remove selected products from our e-commerce site, or from our customers\u2019 homes. Such recalls and voluntary removal of products can result in, among other things, lost sales, diverted resources, potential harm to our reputation and increased customer service costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. In addition, given the terms of our lease agreements with our customers, in the event of such a product quality or safety issue, our customers who have leased the defective merchandise from us could terminate their lease agreements for that merchandise and/or not renew those lease arrangements, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition if we are unable to recover those losses from the vendor who supplied us with the defective merchandise.\nOur management information systems may not be adequate to meet our evolving business and emerging regulatory needs and the failure to successfully implement them could negatively impact the business and its financial results. We are investing significant capital in new information technology systems to support our growth plan. These investments include redundancies and acquiring new systems and hardware with updated functionality. We are taking appropriate actions to ensure the successful implementation of these initiatives, including the testing of new systems, with minimal disruptions to the business. These efforts may take longer and may require greater financial and other resources than anticipated, may cause distraction of key personnel, may cause disruptions to our systems and our business, and may not provide the anticipated benefits. The disruption in our information technology systems, or our inability to improve, integrate or expand our systems to meet our evolving business and emerging regulatory requirements, could impair our ability to achieve critical strategic initiatives and could adversely impact our sales, collections efforts, cash flows and financial condition.\nIf we do not maintain the privacy and security of customer, retail partner, employee or other confidential information, due to cybersecurity-related \u201chacking\u201d attacks, intrusions into our systems by unauthorized parties or otherwise, we could incur significant costs, litigation, regulatory enforcement actions and damage to our reputation, any one of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Our business involves the collection, processing, transmission and storage of customers\u2019 personal and confidential information, including dates of birth, banking information, credit and debit card information, data we receive from consumer reporting companies, including credit report information, as well as confidential information about our retail partners and employees, among others. Much of this data constitutes confidential personally identifiable information (\u201cPII\u201d) which, if unlawfully accessed, either through a \u201chacking\u201d attack or otherwise, could subject us to significant liabilities as further discussed below. Companies like us that possess significant amounts of PII and/or other confidential information have experienced a significant increase in cyber security risks in recent years from increasingly aggressive and sophisticated cyberattacks, including hacking, computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, ransomware, social engineering attacks (including phishing and impersonation), denial-of-service attacks and other attacks and similar disruptions from the unauthorized use of or access to information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems. Our IT systems are subject to constant attempts to gain unauthorized access in order to disrupt our business operations and capture, destroy or manipulate various types of information that we rely on, including PII and/or other confidential information. In addition, various third parties, including employees, contractors or others with whom we do business may attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to obtain such information, or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. Any significant compromise or breach of our data security, whether external or internal, or misuse of PII and/or other confidential information may result in significant costs, litigation and regulatory enforcement actions and, therefore, may have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Further, if any such compromise, breach or misuse is not detected quickly, the effect could be compounded. While we have implemented network security systems and processes to protect against unauthorized access to or use of secured data and to prevent data loss and theft, there is no guarantee that these procedures are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches or misuse of the data. We maintain private liability insurance intended to help mitigate the financial risks of such incidents, but there can be no guarantee that insurance will be sufficient to cover all losses related to such incidents, and our exposure resulting from any serious unauthorized access to, or use of, secured data, or serious data loss or theft, could far exceed the limits of our insurance coverage for such events. Further, a significant compromise of PII and/or other confidential information could result in regulatory penalties and harm our reputation with our customers, retail partners and others, potentially resulting in a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. The regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy is increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs. We also believe successful data breaches or cybersecurity incidents at other companies, whether or not we are involved, could lead to a general loss of customer confidence that could negatively affect us, including harming the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures or financial technology in general. We believe our exposure to this risk will increase as we expand our use of financial technology to communicate with our customers and retail partners and as we increase the number of retail partners with whom we work.\nIf we fail to maintain adequate systems and processes to detect and prevent fraudulent activity, our business could be adversely impacted. Criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities such as paper instrument counterfeiting, fraudulent payment or refund schemes and identity theft. As we make more of our services available over the internet and other media, we subject ourselves to consumer fraud risk. We use a variety of tools to protect against fraud; however, these tools may not always be successful.\nOur failure to maintain an effective system of internal controls could result in inaccurate reporting of financial results and harm our business. We are required to comply with a variety of reporting, accounting and other rules and regulations. As a public reporting company subject to the rules and regulations established from time to time by the SEC and the Nasdaq Capital Market, we are required to, among other things, establish and periodically evaluate procedures with respect to our disclosure controls and procedures. In addition, as a public company, we are required to document and test our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 so that our management can certify, on an annual basis, that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. As such, we maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting, but there are limitations inherent in internal control systems. A control system can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be appropriate relative to their costs. Furthermore, compliance with existing requirements is expensive and we may need to implement additional finance and accounting and other systems, procedures and controls to satisfy our reporting requirements. If our internal control over financial reporting is determined to be ineffective, such failure could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, negatively affect the market price of our common stock, subject us to regulatory investigations and penalties, and adversely impact our business and financial condition.\nRisks Relating to our Stock\nBecause of their significant stock ownership and ability to select a nominee to our Board of Directors, certain beneficial owners of our stock, as well as our executive officers and directors, will be able to exert control over the Company and significant corporate decisions. B2 FIE V LLC (\u201cB2 FIE\u201d), a holder of series 2 convertible preferred stock and a seat on our Board, beneficially owns 21.1% of the voting power of our outstanding stock as of March 30, 2022. Our secured lender beneficially owns 5.9% of the voting power of our outstanding stock as of March 30, 2022. Also, our executive officers and other directors beneficially own an additional 25.2% of the voting power of our outstanding stock as of the same date. In the event that they act in concert on future stockholder matters, such persons may have the ability to affect the election of all of our directors and the outcome of all issues submitted to our stockholders. Such concentration of ownership could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of common stock and could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire, control of us. Additionally, pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement entered into in connection with its investment in the Company, B2 FIE currently has the right to designate one nominee on our Board of Directors. As a result, the presence of directors on our Board of Directors nominated by these investors enables such investors to influence and impact future actions taken by our Board of Directors.\nThe price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly and is likely to continue to do so. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, the closing price for our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market ranged from $2.16 to $3.84 per share. The market price for our common stock can fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, including the factors listed in this Risk Factors section, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include: actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results; announcements of new services by our competitors or us; announcements relating to strategic relationships or acquisitions; dilution caused by additional equity issuances; our ability to meet market expectations with respect to the growth and profitability of each of our operating segments; quarterly variations in our competitors\u2019 results of operations; state or federal legislative or regulatory proposals, initiatives, actions or changes that are, or are perceived to be, adverse to our operations; changes in financial estimates or other statements by securities analysts; and other changes in general economic conditions. Because of this, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of our stockholders or others, and the market price for our common stock could fluctuate as a result. In addition, the securities markets have from time-to-time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. Any future determination to pay cash dividends will be dependent upon our financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, applicable contractual restrictions and other such factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant. We are additionally restricted under our Credit Agreement from declaring or making any dividends in cash or stock, subject to certain limited permitted dividend payments assuming we have positive net income and there is no existing default or event of default thereunder.\nIncreased costs associated with corporate governance compliance may significantly impact our results of operations. Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance, public disclosure and compliance practices, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and new SEC regulations, may create difficulties for companies such as ours in understanding and complying with these laws and regulations. As a result of these difficulties and other factors, devoting the necessary resources to comply with evolving corporate governance and public disclosure standards has resulted in and may in the future result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention to compliance activities. We also expect these developments to increase our legal compliance and financial reporting costs. In addition, these developments may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. Moreover, we may be unable to comply with these new laws and regulations on a timely basis. These developments could make it more difficult for us to retain qualified members of our Board of Directors, or qualified executive officers. We are presently evaluating and monitoring regulatory developments and cannot estimate the timing or magnitude of additional costs we may incur as a result. To the extent these costs are significant, our general and administrative expenses are likely to increase.\nIf we sell shares of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock in future financings, the ownership interest of existing shareholders will be diluted and, as a result, our stock price may go down. We may from time to time issue additional shares of common stock, possibly at a discount from the current trading price of our common stock, or securities convertible into our common stock. As a result, our existing shareholders will experience immediate dilution upon the purchase of any shares of our Common Stock sold at a discount. If we issue common stock or securities convertible into common stock, our shareholders will experience dilution and this dilution will be greater if we find it necessary to sell securities at a discount to prevailing market prices.\nOur certificate of incorporation allows for our Board of Directors to create new series of preferred stock without further approval by our stockholders, which could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock. Our Board of Directors has the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred stock and to issue up to 500,000 shares of our preferred stock (of which 250,000 shares have been designated as series 1 convertible preferred stock and 25,000 shares have been designated as series 2 convertible preferred stock) without further stockholder approval. As a result, our Board of Directors could authorize the issuance of additional series of preferred stock that would grant to holders the preferred right to our assets upon liquidation, the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of common stock and the right to the redemption of the shares, together with a premium, prior to the redemption of our common stock. In addition, our Board of Directors could authorize the issuance of additional series of preferred stock that has greater voting power than our common stock or that is convertible into our common stock, which could decrease the relative voting power of our common stock or result in dilution to our existing stockholders. Although we have no present intention to issue any additional shares of preferred stock or to create any additional series of preferred stock, we may decide to issue such shares in the future.", "PERMNO": 16458, "SIC": 7359, "TIC": "FPAY"}
