{"cik": "1606440", "company": "Reliant Bancorp, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-08", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nReliant Bancorp\u2019s decisions regarding credit risk and reserves for loan losses may materially and adversely affect its business.\nMaking loans and other extensions of credit is an essential element of Reliant Bank\u2019s business. Although Reliant Bank seeks to mitigate risks inherent in lending by adhering to specific underwriting practices, its loans and other extensions of credit may not be repaid. The risk of nonpayment is affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe duration of the credit;\n\u2022\ncredit risks of a particular customer;\n\u2022\nchanges in micro or macro economic and industry conditions; and\n\u2022\nin the case of a collateralized loan, risks resulting from uncertainties about the future value of the collateral.\nReliant Bank attempts to maintain an appropriate allowance for loan losses to provide for potential losses in its loan portfolio. Reliant Bank periodically determines the amount of the allowance based on consideration of several factors, including:\n\u2022\nan ongoing review of the quality, mix, and size of Reliant Bank\u2019s overall loan portfolio;\n\u2022\nReliant Bank\u2019s historical loan loss experience;\n\u2022\nevaluation of micro and macro economic conditions;\n\u2022\nregular reviews of loan delinquencies and loan portfolio quality; and\n\u2022\nthe amount and quality of collateral, including guarantees, securing the loans.\nThere is no precise method of predicting credit losses; therefore, Reliant Bank faces the risk that charge-offs in future periods will exceed its allowance for loan losses and that additional increases in the allowance for loan losses will be required. Additions to the allowance for loan losses would result in a decrease in Reliant Bancorp\u2019s net income, and possibly its capital.\nFederal and state regulators periodically review Reliant Bank\u2019s allowance for loan losses and may require Reliant Bank to increase its provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of its management. Any increase in the amount of Reliant Bank\u2019s provision or loans charged-off as required by these regulatory agencies could have a negative effect on its operating results.\nReliant Bank may have higher loan losses than it has allowed for in its allowance for loan losses. Our loan portfolio includes a meaningful amount of construction and development, commercial mortgage, and other commercial loans, which have a greater credit risk than residential mortgage loans.\nReliant Bank\u2019s actual loan losses could exceed its allowance for loan losses. Reliant Bank\u2019s average loan size continues to increase and reliance on its historic allowance for loan losses may not be adequate. A large portion of Reliant Bank\u2019s loan portfolio is composed of construction and development, commercial mortgage, and other commercial loans. Repayment of such loans is generally considered more subject to market risk than residential mortgage loans. Industry experience shows that a portion of loans will become delinquent and a portion of loans will require partial or entire charge-off. Regardless of the underwriting criteria used, losses may be experienced as a result of various factors beyond Reliant Bank\u2019s control, including, among other things, changes in market conditions affecting the value of loan collateral and problems affecting the credit of Reliant Bank\u2019s borrowers.\nA new accounting standard may require Reliant Bank to increase its allowance for loan losses and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board has adopted a new accounting standard that will be effective for Reliant Bank beginning January 1, 2021. This standard, referred to as current expected credit loss, or CECL, will require financial institutions to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans, and recognize the expected credit losses through provision for loan losses. This will change the current method of provisioning for loan losses that are probable, which may require Reliant Bank to increase its allowance for loan losses, and is likely to increase the types of data Reliant Bank would need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of its allowance for loan losses. In addition, this change may result in more volatility in the level of Reliant Bank's allowance for loan losses. An increase, to the extent material, in Reliant Bank's allowance for loan losses or expenses incurred to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses could have a material adverse effect on our capital levels, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision; compliance with new and existing legislation, regulations, and supervisory requirements and expectations could detrimentally affect our business.\nReliant Bancorp and Reliant Bank are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision, the primary focus of which is to protect customers, depositors, the deposit insurance fund, and the safety and soundness of the banking system as a whole, and not shareholders. The quantity and scope of applicable federal and state regulations may place banks at a competitive disadvantage compared to less regulated competitors such as finance companies, credit unions, and leasing companies. Banking and consumer lending laws and regulations apply to almost every aspect of our business, including lending, capital, investments, deposits, other services, and products, risk management, dividends, and acquisitions.\nLegislation and regulation with respect to our industry has increased in recent years, and we expect that federal and state supervision and regulation of our industry will continue to expand in scope and complexity. Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, rules, regulations and policies for possible changes. Changes to statutes, rules, regulations or regulatory policies, including changes in the interpretation or implementation of statutes, rule, regulations or policies, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways, and could subject us to additional costs, limits on the services and products we may offer, or limits on the pricing of banking services and products. In addition, establishing systems and processes to achieve compliance with laws, rules and regulations increases our costs and could limit our ability to pursue business opportunities.\nIf we receive less than satisfactory results on regulatory examinations, we could be subject to damage to our reputation, significant fines and penalties, requirements to increase compliance and risk management activities, and an increase in our deposit insurance assessment rate, in addition to related costs and restrictions on acquisitions, new locations, new lines of business, or continued growth. Future changes in federal and state banking laws and regulations could adversely affect our operating results and ability to continue to compete effectively. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act and related regulations subject us to additional restrictions, oversight and reporting obligations, which have significantly increased costs, although certain provisions of the Regulatory Relief Act may alleviate some of these burdens (however the impact of the Regulatory Relief Act is currently unknown because\nimplementing rules and regulations are required in some instances and many of these implementing rules and regulations have not yet been written or finalized). Also, over the last several years, state and federal regulators have focused on enhanced risk management practices, compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering laws, including the new beneficial ownership rule, data integrity and security, use of service providers, and fair lending and other consumer protection issues, which has increased our need to build additional processes and infrastructure. Government agencies charged with adopting and interpreting laws, rules and regulations may do so in an unforeseen manner, including in ways that potentially expand the reach of the laws, rules or regulations more than initially contemplated or currently anticipated. We cannot predict the substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulation. Compliance with such current and potential legislation and regulation and increased regulatory scrutiny could significantly increase our costs, impede the efficiency of our internal business processes, require us to increase our regulatory capital and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner. Our success depends on our ability to maintain compliance with both existing and new laws, rules and regulations.\nOur recent acquisition and growth and future expansion may result in additional risks.\nOver the last three years, we have completed the acquisition of Community First and expanded into new markets via organic growth. We expect to continue to expand in our current markets and in other select markets through additional branches or through additional acquisitions of all or part of other financial institutions. These types of expansions involve various risks, including the risks detailed below.\nGrowth. As a result of our acquisition activity and organic growth, we may be unable to successfully:\n\u2022\nmaintain acceptable loan quality in the context of significant loan growth;\n\u2022\nobtain regulatory and other approvals;\n\u2022\nattract or retain sufficient deposits and capital to fund anticipated loan growth;\n\u2022\nmaintain adequate common equity and regulatory capital;\n\u2022\navoid diversion or disruption of our existing operations or management as well as those of any acquired institution;\n\u2022\nmaintain adequate management personnel and systems to oversee and support such growth;\n\u2022\nmaintain adequate internal audit, loan review and compliance functions; and\n\u2022\nimplement additional policies, procedures and operating systems required to support such growth.\nResults of Operations. There is no assurance that existing offices or future offices will maintain or achieve deposit levels, loan balances or other operating results necessary to avoid losses or produce profits. Our growth strategy necessarily entails growth in overhead expenses as we routinely add new offices and staff. Our historical results may not be indicative of future results or results that may be achieved as we continue to increase the number and concentration of our branch offices in our newer markets.\nDevelopment of Offices. There are considerable costs involved in opening branches, and new branches generally do not generate sufficient revenues to offset their costs until they have been in operation for at least a year or more. Accordingly, any new branches we establish can be expected to negatively impact our earnings for some period of time until they reach certain economies of scale. The same is true for our efforts to expand in current markets with the hiring of additional seasoned professionals with significant experience in those markets. Our expenses could be further increased if we encounter delays in opening new branches. We may be unable to accomplish future branch expansion plans due to a lack of available satisfactory sites, difficulties in acquiring such sites, failure to receive any required regulatory approvals, increased expenses or loss of potential sites due to complexities associated with zoning and permitting processes, higher than anticipated merger and acquisition costs or other factors. Finally, we can have no assurance any branch will be successful even after it has been established or acquired, as the case may be.\nRegulatory and Economic Factors. Our growth and expansion plans may be adversely affected by a number of regulatory and economic developments or other events. Failure to obtain required regulatory approvals, changes in laws and regulations or other regulatory developments and changes in prevailing economic conditions or other unanticipated events may prevent or adversely affect our continued growth and expansion. Such factors may cause us to alter our growth and expansion plans or slow or halt the growth and expansion process, which may prevent us from entering into or expanding in our targeted markets or allow competitors to gain or retain market share in our existing markets.\nFailure to successfully address these and other issues related to our expansionary activities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, and could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our business strategy. Also, if our growth occurs more slowly than anticipated or declines, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nLiquidity risk could impair our ability to fund our operations and jeopardize our financial condition.\nLiquidity represents an institution\u2019s ability to provide funds to satisfy demands from depositors, borrowers and other creditors by either converting assets into cash or accessing new or existing sources of incremental funds. Liquidity risk arises from the possibility that we may be unable to satisfy current or future funding requirements and needs.\nThe objective of managing liquidity risk is to ensure that our cash flow requirements resulting from depositor, borrower and other creditor demands as well as our operating cash needs are met, and that our cost of funding such requirements and needs is reasonable. We maintain an asset/liability and interest rate risk policy and a liquidity and funds management policy, including a contingency funding plan, that, among other things, include procedures for managing and monitoring liquidity risk. Generally, we rely on deposits, repayments of loans and leases and cash flows from our investment securities as our primary sources of funds. Our principal deposit sources include consumer, commercial and public funds customers in our markets. We have used these funds, together with federal funds purchased and other sources of short-term and long-term borrowings, to make loans and leases, acquire investment securities and other assets and to fund continuing operations.\nAn inability to maintain or raise funds in amounts necessary to meet our liquidity needs could have a substantial negative effect on Reliant Bank\u2019s liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities, or on terms attractive to us, could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general. For example, factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market downturn or adverse regulatory action against us, a reduction in our credit rating, any damage to our reputation or any other decrease in depositor or investor confidence in our creditworthiness and business. Our access to liquidity could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as severe volatility or disruption of the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole. Any such event or failure to manage our liquidity effectively could affect our competitive position, increase our borrowing costs and the interest rates we pay on deposits, limit our access to the capital markets and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nDeposit levels may be affected by a number of factors, including rates paid by competitors, general interest rate levels, returns available to customers on alternative investments, general economic and market conditions and other factors. Loan and lease repayments are a relatively stable source of funds but are subject to the borrowers\u2019 and lessees\u2019 ability to repay loans and leases, which can be adversely affected by a number of factors including changes in general economic conditions, adverse trends or events affecting business industry groups or specific businesses, declines in real estate values or markets, business closings or lay-offs, inclement weather, natural disasters and other factors. Furthermore, loans and leases generally are not readily convertible to cash. Accordingly, we may be required from time to time to rely on secondary sources of liquidity to meet growth in demand for loans and leases, deposit withdrawal demands or otherwise fund operations. Such secondary sources include FHLB advances, brokered deposits, secured and unsecured federal funds lines of credit from correspondent banks, Federal Reserve borrowings and/or accessing the equity or debt capital markets.\nWe anticipate we will continue to rely primarily on deposits, loan and lease repayments, and cash flows from our investment securities to provide liquidity. Additionally, where necessary, the secondary sources of borrowed funds described above will be used to augment our primary funding sources. If we are unable to access any of these secondary funding sources when needed, we might be unable to meet our customers\u2019 or creditors\u2019 needs, which would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.\nWe may face risks with respect to future acquisitions.\nWhen we attempt to expand our business through mergers and acquisitions (as we have done over the last several years), we seek targets that are culturally similar to us, have experienced management and possess either market presence or have potential for improved profitability through economies of scale or expanded services. In addition to the general risks associated with our growth plans which are highlighted above, in general, acquiring other banks, businesses or branches, particularly those in markets with which we are less familiar, involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe time and costs associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisition and merger targets;\n\u2022\ninaccuracies in the estimates and judgments used to evaluate credit, operations, management and market risks with respect to the target institution;\n\u2022\nthe time and costs associated with evaluating new markets, hiring experienced local management, including as a result of de novo expansion into a market, and opening new bank locations, and the time lags between these activities and the generation of sufficient assets and deposits to support the significant costs of the expansion that we may incur, particularly in the first 12 to 24 months of operations;\n\u2022\nour ability to finance an acquisition and possible dilution to our existing shareholders;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of our management\u2019s attention to the negotiation of a transaction and integration of an acquired company\u2019s operations with ours;\n\u2022\nthe incurrence of an impairment of goodwill associated with an acquisition and adverse effects on our results of operations;\n\u2022\nentry into new markets where we have limited or no direct prior experience;\n\u2022\nclosing delays and increased expenses related to the resolution of lawsuits filed by our shareholders or shareholders of companies we may seek to acquire;\n\u2022\nthe inability to receive regulatory approvals timely or at all, including as a result of community objections, or such approvals being restrictively conditional; and\n\u2022\nrisks associated with integrating the operations, technologies and personnel of an acquired business.\nWe expect to continue to evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities that are presented to us in our current markets as well as other markets throughout the region and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions. As a result, merger or acquisition discussions and, in some cases, negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving cash or equity securities and related capital raising transactions may occur at any time. Generally, acquisitions of financial institutions involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and, therefore, some dilution of our book value and fully diluted earnings per share may occur in connection with any future transaction. Failure to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in product presence and/or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we may face significant competition from numerous other financial institutions, many of which may have greater financial resources than we do, when considering acquisition opportunities. Accordingly, attractive acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying or completing any potential future acquisitions.\nThe value of our goodwill and other intangible assets may decline in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $51.9 million of goodwill and other intangible assets. A significant decline in our financial condition, a significant adverse change in the business climate, slower growth rates, or a significant and sustained decline in the price of our common stock may necessitate taking charges in the future related to the impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets. If we were to conclude that a future write-down of goodwill and other intangible assets is necessary, we would record the appropriate charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Future acquisitions of other financial institutions could result in additional goodwill.\nReliant Bank\u2019s focus on lending to small to mid-sized community based businesses may increase Reliant Bancorp\u2019s credit risk.\nMost of Reliant Bank\u2019s commercial business and commercial real estate loans are made to small business or middle market customers. These businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities and have a heightened vulnerability to economic conditions. If general economic conditions in the markets in which Reliant Bank operates negatively impact this important customer sector, Reliant Bancorp\u2019s results of operations and financial condition and the value of its common stock may be adversely affected. Furthermore, the deterioration of Reliant Bank\u2019s borrowers\u2019 businesses may hinder their ability to repay their loans with Reliant Bank, which could have a material adverse effect on Reliant Bancorp\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nReliant Bancorp is geographically concentrated in Middle Tennessee and changes in local economic conditions impact our profitability.\nWe currently operate primarily in the Nashville MSA, and most of our loan, deposit and other customers live or have operations in this area. Accordingly, our success significantly depends upon the growth in population, income levels, deposits, and housing starts in this market, along with the continued attraction of business ventures to the areas, and our profitability is impacted by the changes in general economic conditions in this market. We cannot assure you that economic conditions, including loan demand, in our market will improve during 2019, or thereafter, and in that case, we may not be able to grow our loan portfolio in line with our expectations. In addition, the ability of our customers to repay their loans to us may be negatively impacted and our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nCompared to regional or national financial institutions, we are less able to spread the risks of unfavorable local economic conditions across a large number of diversified economies. Moreover, we cannot give any assurance that we will benefit from any market growth or more favorable economic conditions in our primary market areas if they do occur.\nReliant Bank faces strong competition for customers, which could prevent it from obtaining customers and may cause it to pay higher interest rates to attract customers.\nThe banking business is highly competitive, and Reliant Bank experiences competition in its markets from many other financial institutions. Reliant Bank competes with commercial banks, credit unions, savings and loan associations, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market funds, and other mutual funds, as well as other super-regional, national, and international financial institutions that operate offices in Reliant Bank\u2019s primary market areas and elsewhere. Reliant Bank competes with these institutions both in attracting deposits and in making loans. In addition, Reliant Bank has to attract its customer base from other existing financial institutions and from new residents and businesses that have relocated to the Nashville MSA. Many of Reliant Bank\u2019s competitors are well-established, larger financial institutions. These institutions offer some services, such as extensive and established branch networks, that Reliant Bank does not provide. There is a risk that Reliant Bank will not be able to compete successfully with other financial institutions in Reliant Bank\u2019s markets, and that it may have to pay higher interest rates to attract deposits, resulting in reduced profitability. In addition, competitors that are not depository institutions are generally not subject to the extensive regulations that apply to Reliant Bank.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes and we may not have the resources to implement new technology to stay current with these changes.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes, with new technology-driven products and services being frequently introduced. In addition to better serving customers, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. Our future success will depend in part upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience as well as to provide secure electronic environments as we continue to grow and expand our market area. Many of our larger competitors have substantially greater resources to invest, and have invested significantly more than us, in technological improvements. As a result, they may be able to offer additional or more convenient products compared to those that we will be able to provide, which would put us at a competitive disadvantage. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing such products and services to our customers, which could impair our growth and profitability.\nReliant Bank\u2019s FDIC deposit insurance premiums and assessments may increase.\nDeposits in Reliant Bank are insured by the FDIC up to legal limits and, as a result, we are subject to the payment of FDIC deposit insurance premiums and assessments. High levels of bank failures since the financial crisis and increases in the statutory deposit insurance limits have increased resolution costs to the FDIC and put significant pressure on the Deposit Insurance Fund. In order to maintain a strong funding position and restore the reserve ratios of the Deposit Insurance Fund following the financial crisis, the FDIC increased deposit insurance assessment rates and charged special assessments to all FDIC-insured financial institutions. Further increases in assessment rates or special assessments may occur in the future, especially if there are significant additional failures of financial institutions. Any future special assessments, increases in assessment rates, or required prepayments of FDIC insurance premiums could reduce our profitability or limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges in prevailing interest rates may reduce Reliant Bancorp\u2019s profitability.\nReliant Bancorp\u2019s results of operations depend in large part upon the level of its net interest income, which is the difference between interest income from interest earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities, such as deposits and other borrowings. Depending on the terms and maturities of Reliant Bancorp\u2019s assets and liabilities, Reliant Bancorp believes it is more likely than not that a significant change in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on its net interest income and, therefore, its profitability. Many factors cause changes in interest rates, including governmental monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions. While Reliant Bancorp intends to manage the effects of changes in interest rates by adjusting the terms, maturities, and pricing of its assets and liabilities, its efforts may not be effective and its financial condition and results of operations could suffer.\nReliant Bancorp and Reliant Bank are dependent on key individuals and the loss of one or more of these key individuals could curtail its growth and adversely affect its prospects.\nReliant Bancorp and Reliant Bank are materially dependent on the performance of their executive management teams, loan officers, and other support personnel. The loss of the services of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on the business of Reliant Bancorp and Reliant Bank and our results of operations and financial condition. Many of these key personnel have important customer relationships, which are instrumental to Reliant Bank\u2019s operations. Changes in key personnel and their responsibilities may be disruptive to Reliant Bancorp's and Reliant Bank\u2019s business and could have a material adverse effect on Reliant Bancorp's and Reliant Bank\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations. Management believes that future\nresults also will depend in part upon attracting and retaining highly skilled and qualified management, especially in the new market areas into which Reliant Bank may enter, as well as sales and marketing personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense, and management cannot be sure that Reliant Bank will be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel.\nReliant Bancorp is an emerging growth company, and it cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make Reliant Bancorp\u2019s common stock less attractive to investors.\nReliant Bancorp is subject to periodic reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Reliant Bancorp is an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, however, and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, even if Reliant Bancorp chooses to comply with the reporting requirements applicable to public companies that are not emerging growth companies, Reliant Bancorp may avail itself of the reduced requirements applicable to emerging growth companies from time to time in the future, so long as Reliant Bancorp is an emerging growth company. Reliant Bancorp will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, though it may cease to be an emerging growth company earlier under certain circumstances, including if, before the end of such five years, it is deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC (which depends on, among other things, having a market value of common stock held by non-affiliates in excess of $700 million) or if Reliant Bancorp\u2019s total annual gross revenues equal or exceed $1.07 billion in a fiscal year. Reliant Bancorp cannot predict if investors will find its common stock less attractive because it will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find Reliant Bancorp\u2019s common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for Reliant Bancorp\u2019s common stock and its stock price may be more volatile.\nFurther, the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. Reliant Bancorp has elected not to opt out of such an extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, Reliant Bancorp, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make Reliant Bancorp\u2019s financial statements not comparable with those of another public company that is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\nThe short-term and long-term impact of the changing regulatory capital requirements and recently proposed capital rules is uncertain.\nOn September 12, 2010, the Group of Governors and Heads of Supervision, the oversight body of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, announced agreement to a strengthened set of capital requirements for internationally active banking organizations in the U.S. and around the world, known as Basel III. Basel III called for increases in the requirements for minimum common equity, minimum Tier 1 capital and minimum total capital for certain systemically important financial institutions, to be phased in over time until fully phased in by January 1, 2019. The final rules were adopted by the federal banking agencies in July 2013.\nThe Regulatory Relief Act requires federal banking agencies to develop a community bank leverage ratio (defined as the ratio of tangible equity capital to average total consolidated assets) for banks and holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion and an appropriate risk profile. The required regulations must specify a minimum community bank leverage ratio of not less than 8% and not more than 10%, as well as procedures for treatment of a qualifying community bank that has a community bank leverage ratio that falls below the required minimum. Qualifying banks that exceed the minimum community bank leverage ratio will be deemed to be in compliance with all other capital and leverage requirements, thus being relieved from the requirements of Basel III.\nOn November 21, 2018, pursuant to the Regulatory Relief Act, the federal banking agencies issued a notice of proposed rulemaking proposing a community bank leverage ratio of 9% and corresponding capital adequacy levels. As proposed, a community bank with a community bank leverage ratio of 9% or greater would be considered \u201cwell capitalized;\u201d a community bank with a community bank leverage ratio of 7.5% or greater would be considered \u201cadequately capitalized;\u201d a community bank with a community bank leverage ratio of less than 7.5% would be considered \u201cundercapitalized;\u201d and a community bank with a community bank leverage ratio of less than 6% would be considered \u201csignificantly undercapitalized\u201d and would be\nrequired to provide its primary regulator with additional information in order to determine whether such organization would be classified as \u201ccritically undercapitalized.\u201d The comment period for the proposed rule has since closed, but the regulation is not yet finalized.\nThe application of more stringent capital requirements for Reliant Bancorp or Reliant Bank could, among other things, result in lower returns on invested capital, require the issuance of additional capital, and result in regulatory actions if Reliant Bancorp or Reliant Bank were to be unable to comply with such requirements.\nInterest rate movements, inflation, and other economic factors can negatively impact our mortgage banking business.\nOur mortgage banking business is subject to and affected by the risks generally incident to the broader mortgage banking business, including interest rate levels and the impact of government regulation on mortgage loan originations and servicing. Our mortgage banking business also is affected by interest rate fluctuations. During periods of higher and rising interest rates, the demand for mortgage loans and the level of refinancing activity generally tends to decline, which can lead to reduced loan volumes and lower revenues, which could negatively impact our earnings. Increases in interest rates may have a material adverse effect on our mortgage banking revenue and profitability. Our mortgage loan operations may also be adversely affected by other economic factors within our markets such as negative changes in employment levels, job growth, and consumer confidence and availability of mortgage financing, one or all of which could result in reduced demand or price depression from current levels. Our mortgage banking operations are also dependent upon the securitization market for mortgage-backed securities, and could be materially adversely affected by any fluctuation or downturn in such market. In the event that disruptions to the secondary markets tighten or eliminate the available liquidity within the secondary markets for mortgage loans, we could experience a material adverse effect with respect to sales of mortgage loans and the profitability of our mortgage banking business.\nIf the underwriting quality of our mortgage loan originations is found to be deficient, our profitability could decrease and we may incur losses.\nWe provide several different loan products to our customers to finance the purchases of their homes. We sell a large number of the mortgage loans we originate into the secondary mortgage market, and those loans are underwritten to the standards and specifications of the ultimate investor. Insofar as we underwrite our originated loans to those standards, we bear no increased concentration of credit risk from the issuance of loans, except in certain limited instances where early payment default occurs. In the event that a substantial number of the loans that we have originated fall into default and the investors to whom we sold the loans determine that we did not underwrite the loans in accordance with their requirements, we could be required to repurchase the loans from the investors or indemnify the investors for any losses incurred. This may result in losses that could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations.\nReliant Bank could incur significant costs and expenses related to Reliant Mortgage Ventures, LLC, and these costs and expenses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nReliant Bank is a member in Reliant Mortgage Ventures, LLC (\u201cRMV\u201d), a Tennessee limited liability company organized in 2011. RMV provides mortgage banking services to bank customers. Reliant Bank holds 51% of the governance rights in RMV and 30% of the financial rights in RMV. VHC Fund 1, LLC (\u201cVHC\u201d) is the other member of RMV and holds 49% of the governance rights in RMV and 70% of the financial rights in RMV. Under the terms of the RMV operating agreement, VHC is required to fund RMV\u2019s losses via additional capital contributions to RMV. RMV incurred a net loss of $3.58 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, and has incurred cumulative net losses of $8.06 million since inception. Also, per the terms of the RMV operating agreement, VHC is to receive all distributions of cash flow from RMV until such time as VHC has recovered its capital contributions to RMV. After the return to VHC of its capital contributions, VHC is to receive 70% of RMV cash flow distributions and Reliant Bank is to receive 30% of RMV cash flow distributions. There can be no assurance that RMV will ever generate sufficient income to return to VHC its aggregate capital contributions or that Reliant Bank will ever receive cash flow distributions from RMV.\nTo date, VHC has not failed to make a required contribution of additional capital to RMV to cover losses incurred by the company. In the event VHC fails to make a required contribution of additional capital to cover losses of RMV, Reliant Bank has the right to cause the dissolution of RMV. However, in such event, Reliant Bank could also be required to fund losses of RMV not funded by VHC, which losses could be significant. Additionally, in the event Reliant Bank were to cause the dissolution of RMV, there would be costs and expenses associated with dissolving RMV and winding up the company\u2019s operations or integrating them with those of Reliant Bank, and those costs and expenses could be significant. Accordingly, VHC\u2019s failure to make a required contribution of additional capital to cover losses of RMV and/or Reliant Bank\u2019s decision to cause the\ndissolution of RMV in the event of such a failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nLaws and regulations relating to privacy, information security and data protection could increase our costs, affect or limit how we collect and use personal information and adversely affect our business opportunities.\nWe are subject to various privacy, information security and data protection laws, including requirements relating to security breach notification, and we could be negatively impacted by them. For example, we are subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (\u201cGLBA\u201d) and related implementing regulations and guidance. Among other things, GLBA: (i) imposes certain limitations on the ability of financial institutions to share consumers\u2019 nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third parties, (ii) requires that financial institutions provide certain disclosures to consumers about their information collection, sharing and security practices and affords consumers the right to \u201copt out\u201d of the institution\u2019s disclosure of their personal financial information to nonaffiliated third parties (with certain exceptions) and (iii) requires financial institutions to develop, implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate to the financial institution\u2019s size and complexity, the nature and scope of the financial institution\u2019s activities, and the sensitivity of customer information processed by the financial institution as well as plans for responding to data security breaches.\nMoreover, various United States federal agencies, states and foreign jurisdictions have enacted data security breach notification requirements with varying levels of required individual, consumer, regulatory and/or law enforcement notification in certain circumstances in the event of a security breach. Many of these requirements not only apply to us but also apply broadly to our partners that accept payments from our customers. In many countries that have yet to impose data security breach notification requirements, regulators have increasingly used the threat of significant sanctions and penalties by data protection authorities to encourage voluntary notification and discourage data security breaches.\nFurthermore, legislators and/or regulators in the United States are increasingly adopting or revising privacy, information security and data protection laws that potentially could have a significant impact on our current and planned privacy, data protection and information security-related practices, our collection, use, sharing, retention and safeguarding of consumer and/or employee information, and some of our current or planned business activities. This could also increase our costs of compliance and business operations and could reduce income from certain business initiatives. This includes increased privacy-related enforcement activity at the federal level, by the Federal Trade Commission, as well as at the state level, such as with regard to mobile applications.\nCompliance with current or future privacy, data protection and information security laws (including those regarding security breach notification) affecting customer and/or employee data to which we are subject could result in higher compliance and technology costs and could restrict our ability to provide certain products and services, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability. Our failure to comply with privacy, data protection and information security laws could result in potentially significant regulatory and/or governmental investigations and/or actions, litigation, fines, sanctions and damage to our reputation and our brand.\nAnti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing laws could have significant adverse consequences for us.\nWe maintain an enterprise-wide program designed to enable us to comply with applicable anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing laws and regulations, including the Bank Secrecy Act and the USA PATRIOT Act. This program includes policies, procedures, processes and other internal controls designed to identify, monitor, manage and mitigate the risk of money laundering or terrorist financing posed by our products, services, customers and geographic locale. These controls include procedures and processes to detect and report suspicious transactions, perform customer due diligence, respond to requests from law enforcement, and meet all recordkeeping and reporting requirements related to particular transactions involving currency or monetary instruments. We cannot be sure our policies, procedures, processes and controls will be effective to ensure our compliance with all applicable anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing laws and regulations, and our failure to comply could subject us to significant sanctions, fines, penalties and reputational harm, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nReliant Bancorp\u2019s historical operating results may not be indicative of its future operating results.\nReliant Bancorp may not be able to sustain its historical rate of growth, and, consequently, Reliant Bancorp\u2019s historical results of operations will not necessarily be indicative of its future results of operations. Various factors, such as economic conditions, political, regulatory and legislative initiatives and considerations, and competition, may impede Reliant Bancorp\u2019s ability to expand its market presence. If Reliant Bancorp experiences a significant decrease in its historical rate of growth, Reliant Bancorp\u2019s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected because a high percentage of its operating costs are fixed expenses.\nReliant Bancorp may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose our bank to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by the bank cannot be realized on or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nReliant Bancorp\u2019s ability to pay cash dividends is limited, and Reliant Bancorp may be unable to pay future dividends even if it desires to do so.\nEven though our board of directors has approved the payment of cash dividends on Reliant Bancorp\u2019s common stock in recent years, there can be no assurance as to whether or when we may pay dividends on our common stock in the future. Future dividends, if any, will be declared and paid at the discretion of Reliant Bancorp\u2019s board of directors and will depend on a number of factors. Reliant Bancorp\u2019s principal source of funds used to pay cash dividends on its common stock will be dividends that Reliant Bancorp receives from Reliant Bank. Although Reliant Bank\u2019s asset quality, earnings performance, liquidity, and capital requirements will be taken into account before Reliant Bancorp declares or pays any future dividends on its common stock, our board of directors will also consider our liquidity and capital requirements, and our board of directors could determine to declare and pay dividends without relying on dividend payments from Reliant Bank.\nFederal and state banking laws and regulations and state corporate laws restrict the amount of dividends we may declare and pay and that Reliant Bank may declare and pay to Reliant Bancorp. For example, Federal Reserve regulations implementing the capital rules required under Basel III do not permit dividends unless capital levels exceed certain higher levels applying capital conservation buffers that became fully phased in beginning January 1, 2019.\nIn addition, the terms of the subordinated debentures Reliant Bancorp assumed in connection with our acquisition of Community First prohibit us from paying dividends on our common stock at times when we are not current with our payment obligations under the subordinated debentures. Reliant Bancorp may also from time to time enter into other contractual arrangements, including borrowing relationships with other financial institutions, that could limit the ability of Reliant Bancorp to pay dividends on its common stock in the future.\nReliant Bancorp\u2019s stock price may fluctuate, which could result in losses to investors and litigation against Reliant Bancorp.\nReliant Bancorp\u2019s common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC. A number of factors could cause Reliant Bancorp\u2019s stock price to fluctuate substantially in the future. These factors include but are not limited to: actual or anticipated variations in earnings, changes in analysts\u2019 recommendations or projections, Reliant Bancorp\u2019s announcement of developments related to its businesses, operations and stock performance of other companies deemed to be peers, new technology used or services offered by traditional and non-traditional competitors, news reports of trends, irrational exuberance on the part of investors, new federal banking laws, rules or regulations, and other matters related to the financial services industry. Reliant Bancorp\u2019s stock price may fluctuate significantly in the future, and these fluctuations may be unrelated to its performance. General market declines or market volatility in the future, especially in the financial institutions sector, could adversely affect the price of Reliant Bancorp\u2019s common stock, and the current market price may not be indicative of future market prices. Stock price volatility may make it more difficult for Reliant Bancorp\u2019s shareholders to resell their common stock when desired and at prices they find attractive. Moreover, in the past, securities class action lawsuits have been instituted against some companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. Reliant Bancorp could in the future be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources from Reliant Bancorp\u2019s normal business.\nEconomic and other circumstances may require Reliant Bancorp to raise capital at times or in amounts that are unfavorable to it. If Reliant Bancorp has to issue shares of common stock, the issuance will dilute the percentage ownership interest of existing shareholders and may dilute the book value per share of Reliant Bancorp\u2019s common stock and adversely affect the terms on which Reliant Bancorp may obtain additional capital.\nReliant Bancorp may need to incur additional debt or equity financing in the future to make strategic acquisitions or investments or to strengthen its capital position. Reliant Bancorp\u2019s ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on, among other things, conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of our control, and Reliant Bancorp\u2019s financial performance and condition. Reliant Bancorp cannot provide assurance that such financing will be available to Reliant Bancorp on acceptable terms or at all, or if Reliant Bancorp does raise additional capital that it will not be dilutive to existing shareholders.\nIf Reliant Bancorp determines, for any reason, that it needs to raise capital, Reliant Bancorp\u2019s board of directors generally has the authority, without action by or vote of Reliant Bancorp's shareholders, to issue all or part of any authorized but unissued shares of stock for any corporate purpose, including issuance of equity based incentives under or outside of Reliant Bancorp\u2019s equity compensation plans, subject to certain Nasdaq rules. Additionally, Reliant Bancorp is not restricted from issuing additional common stock or preferred stock, including securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common stock or preferred stock or any substantially similar securities. The market price of Reliant Bancorp\u2019s common stock could decline as a result of sales by Reliant Bancorp of a large number of shares of common stock or preferred stock or similar securities in the market or from the perception that such sales could occur. If Reliant Bancorp issues preferred stock that has a preference over its common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, or if Reliant Bancorp issues preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of the common stock, the rights of holders of the common stock or the market price of Reliant Bancorp\u2019s common stock could be adversely affected. Any issuance of additional shares of stock will dilute the percentage ownership interest of Reliant Bancorp\u2019s shareholders and may dilute the book value per share of its common stock. Shares that Reliant Bancorp issues in connection with any such offering will increase the total number of shares outstanding and may dilute the economic and voting ownership interest of Reliant Bancorp\u2019s existing shareholders.\nA failure in or breach of Reliant Bancorp\u2019s or Reliant Bank\u2019s computer or information technology systems or networks, or those of third parties, could disrupt our businesses and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations, as well as cause us reputational harm.\nThe potential for operational risk exposure exists throughout our organization and, as a result of our interactions with and reliance on third parties, is not limited to our own internal operating functions. Our computer and information technology systems and networks, as well as those of third parties, are integral to our business and performance. We rely on our employees and third parties in the course of our day-to-day operations, any of whom may, as a result of human error, misconduct, malfeasance, or a failure or breach of systems or networks, expose us to risk. We have taken measures to implement backup systems and other safeguards to support our operations, but our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant disruptions in or to our computer or information technology systems or networks or those of third parties with whom we interact or upon whom we rely. In addition, our ability to implement backup systems and other safeguards with respect to third-party systems is more limited than with respect to our own systems. Our financial, accounting, data processing, backup, or other operating or security systems, or those of third parties with whom we interact or upon whom we rely, may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond our or such third parties\u2019 control, which could adversely affect our ability to process transactions or provide services. There could be sudden increases in customer transaction volume; electrical, telecommunications, or other major physical infrastructure outages; newly identified vulnerabilities in key hardware or software; natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, and floods; disease pandemics; and events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts. In the event that backup systems are utilized, these systems may not process data as quickly as our primary systems and some data might not have been backed up. We continuously update the systems on which we rely to support our operations and to remain compliant with applicable laws, rules, and regulations. This updating entails significant costs and creates risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones, including business interruptions. Operational risk exposures could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations, as well as cause us reputational harm.\nA cyber-attack, information or security breach, or technology failure, on our part or that of a third party, could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, or adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations, as well as cause us reputational harm.\nOur business is highly dependent on the security and integrity of our computer and information technology systems and networks, as well as those of third parties with whom we interact or on whom we rely. Our business is dependent on the secure processing, transmission, storage, and retrieval of confidential, proprietary, and other information in our computer and information technology systems and networks, and in the computer and information technology systems and networks of third parties. In addition, to access our networks, products, and services, our customers and other third parties may use personal mobile or computing devices that are outside of our network environment and are subject to their own unique cybersecurity risks.\nWe and our third-party service providers and customers have been subject to, and are likely to continue to be the target of, cyber-attacks. These cyber-attacks include computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, phishing attacks, denials of service or information, or other security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss, or destruction of confidential, proprietary, or other information of ours or of our employees or customers or third parties, as well as damages to our and third-party computer and information technology systems and networks and the disruption of our or our customers\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 systems, networks, or business. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any\ninformation security vulnerabilities or incidents. Despite efforts to protect the integrity of our systems and networks and implement controls, processes, policies, and other protective measures, cyber threats are rapidly evolving and we may not be able to anticipate or prevent cyber-attacks or security breaches.\nCybersecurity risks for financial institutions have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies and the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions. For example, cybersecurity risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobile-payment and other internet-based product offerings and expand our internal usage of web-based products and applications. In addition, cybersecurity risks have significantly increased in recent years in part due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime groups, hackers, terrorist organizations, hostile foreign governments, disgruntled employees or vendors, activists, and other external parties. Even the most advanced internal control environment may be vulnerable to compromise. Targeted social engineering attacks are becoming more sophisticated and are extremely difficult to prevent. The techniques used by bad actors change frequently, may not be recognized until launched, and may not be recognized until well after a breach has occurred. Additionally, the occurrence of cyber-attacks or security breaches involving third parties with access to our data, such as vendors, may not be disclosed to us in a timely manner.\nAlthough to date we have not experienced any material losses or other material consequences relating to technology failures, cyber-attacks, or other information or security breaches, whether directed at us or third parties, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses or other consequences in the future. Our risks associated with these matters remains heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats, our size and scale, our role in the financial services industry, our plans to continue to implement our internet banking and mobile banking channel strategies and develop additional remote connectivity solutions to serve our customers when and how they want to be served, our continuous transmission of sensitive information to, and storage of such information by, third parties, the outsourcing of some of our business operations, threats of cyber terrorism, and system and customer account updates and conversions. As a result, cybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes, policies, and other protective measures designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data, and networks from attack, damage, or unauthorized access remain a priority.\nWe also face indirect technology, cybersecurity, and operational risks relating to the customers and other third parties with whom we do business or upon whom we rely to facilitate or enable our business activities, including financial counterparties; financial intermediaries such as clearing agents, exchanges, and clearing houses; vendors; regulators; providers of critical infrastructure such as internet access and electrical power; and retailers for whom we process transactions. As a result of increasing consolidation, interdependence, and complexity of financial entities and technology systems, a technology failure, cyber-attack, or other information or security breach that significantly degrades, deletes, or compromises the systems or data of one or more financial entities could have a material impact on counterparties or other market participants, including us. This consolidation, interdependence, and complexity increases the risk of operational failure, on both individual and industry-wide bases, as disparate systems need to be integrated, often on an accelerated basis. Any third-party technology failure, cyber-attack, or other information or security breach could, among other things, adversely affect our ability to effect transactions, service our customers, manage our exposure to risk, or operate or expand our businesses.\nCyber-attacks or other information or security breaches, whether directed at us or third parties, may result in material losses or have other material adverse consequences. Furthermore, the public perception that a cyber-attack on our systems has been successful, whether or not this perception is correct, could damage our reputation with customers and third parties with whom we do business. A successful penetration or circumvention of the security of our computer or information technology systems or networks could cause us negative consequences, including loss of customers and business opportunities, disruption to our operations and business, misappropriation or destruction of our confidential information or that of our customers, or damage to our customers\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 computers or systems, and could result in a violation of applicable privacy laws and other laws, litigation exposure, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, loss of confidence in our security measures, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, and additional compliance costs, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to certain operational risks, including but not limited to customer or employee fraud.\nEmployee errors and employee and customer misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation. Misconduct by our employees could include hiding unauthorized activities from us, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of our customers or improper use of confidential information. It is not always possible to prevent employee errors and misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Employee errors could also subject us to financial claims for negligence. We maintain a system of internal controls and insurance coverage to mitigate against these operational risks. If our internal controls fail to prevent or detect an occurrence, or if any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance limits, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, we rely heavily upon information supplied by third parties, including information contained in credit applications, property appraisals, title information, valuations and employment and income documentation, in deciding which loans we will originate as well as the terms of those loans. If any of the information upon which we rely is misrepresented, either fraudulently or inadvertently, and the misrepresentation is not detected prior to asset funding, the value of the asset may be significantly lower than expected, or we may fund a loan that we would not have funded or on terms we would not have extended.\nNegative public opinion surrounding Reliant Bancorp and the financial institutions industry generally could damage Reliant Bancorp\u2019s reputation and adversely impact its earnings.\nReputation risk, or the risk to Reliant Bancorp\u2019s business, earnings and capital from negative public opinion surrounding Reliant Bancorp or the financial institutions industry generally, is inherent in Reliant Bancorp\u2019s business. Negative public opinion can result from Reliant Bancorp\u2019s actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, corporate governance and acquisitions, and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect Reliant Bancorp\u2019s ability to keep and attract clients and employees and can expose it to litigation and regulatory action. Although Reliant Bancorp takes steps to minimize reputation risk in dealing with its clients and communities, this risk will always be present given the nature of Reliant Bancorp\u2019s business.\nWe may issue additional common stock or other equity securities in the future which could dilute the ownership interest of existing shareholders.\nIn order to maintain our or Reliant Bank\u2019s capital at desired or regulatory-required levels, we may issue additional shares of common stock, or securities convertible into, exchangeable for or representing rights to acquire shares of common stock. We may sell these shares at prices below the current market price for shares of Reliant Bancorp common stock, and the sale of these shares may significantly dilute existing shareholder ownership. We could also issue additional shares in connection with acquisitions of other financial institutions (as we did in connection with our acquisition of Community First), which could also dilute existing shareholder ownership.\nHolders of our subordinated debentures have rights that are senior to those of our shareholders.\nIn connection with the Community First acquisition, Reliant Bancorp assumed trust preferred securities and accompanying junior subordinated debentures totaling $23.0 million, of which $10.0 million was owned by Community First prior to the acquisition and assumed by Reliant Bancorp. Payments of the principal and interest on the trust preferred securities are conditionally guaranteed by Reliant Bancorp, and the accompanying subordinated debentures are senior to shares of Reliant Bancorp\u2019s common stock. As a result, Reliant Bancorp must make payments on the subordinated debentures (and the related trust preferred securities) before any dividends can be paid on its common stock and, in the event of Reliant Bancorp\u2019s bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holders of the subordinated debentures must be satisfied before any distributions can be made on Reliant Bancorp\u2019s common stock.\nReliant Bancorp may from time to time issue additional subordinated indebtedness that would have to be repaid before Reliant Bancorp\u2019s shareholders would be entitled to receive any of the assets of Reliant Bancorp or Reliant Bank.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nAs a smaller company, it may be difficult for us to attract or retain the interest of equity research analysts. A lack of research coverage may adversely affect the liquidity of and market price of our common stock. We will not have any control over the equity research analysts or the content and opinions included in their reports. The price of our stock could decline if one or more equity research analysts downgrade our stock or issue other unfavorable commentary or research. If one or more equity research analysts ceases coverage of our company, or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nShares of Reliant Bancorp common stock are not FDIC insured.\nShares of Reliant Bancorp common stock are not deposits with a bank and are not insured by the FDIC.", "PERMNO": 15505, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "RBNC"}
