{"cik": "1681689", "company": "Bioverativ Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-02-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this report in evaluating Bioverativ and Bioverativ\u2019s common stock. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition and could adversely impact, or result in volatility to, our stock price.\nRisks Related to the Merger\nThe conditions under the Merger Agreement to Sanofi\u2019s consummation of the Offer and the subsequent Merger may not be satisfied at all or in the anticipated timeframe.\nOn January 21, 2018, Bioverativ entered into the Merger Agreement with Sanofi. The obligation of Merger Sub to purchase Shares tendered in the Offer is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, including (i) that the number of Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn as of the expiration of the Offer, together with any Shares (if any) owned by Parent and its affiliates and excluding any Shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been \u201creceived\u201d (as such term is defined in Section 251(h)(6)(f) of the DGCL), represents at least a majority of the then outstanding Shares (the \u201cMinimum Tender Condition\u201d); (ii) (x) the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended and (y) that all consents of, and/or filings with, any governmental authority of\ncompetent jurisdiction or pursuant to any antitrust laws have been obtained and are in full force and effect and any applicable waiting period with respect thereto has expired; (iii) the absence of any law or order prohibiting the consummation of the Offer or the Merger; (iv) the accuracy of the Company\u2019s representations and warranties under the Merger Agreement (subject to customary materiality qualifiers); (v) the Company\u2019s performance in all material respects of its obligations under the Merger Agreement; (vi) the absence, since the date of the Merger Agreement, of any fact, circumstance, condition, event, change, development, occurrence, result or event which, individually or in the aggregate, has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Merger Agreement); (vii) the delivery to Parent and Merger Sub of a certificate, dated as of the expiration time of the Offer, certifying that the conditions in clauses (iv), (v) and (vi) have been satisfied; (viii) the Merger Agreement has not been terminated; and (ix) that the Company has received and delivered to Biogen and Parent a copy of the tax opinion required by a letter agreement dated January 21, 2018 between Biogen, Parent and the Company (the \u201cLetter Agreement\u201d) and the requirement that the Company deliver such tax opinion pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement between Biogen and the Company dated January 31, 2017 has been satisfied pursuant to the Letter Agreement. These conditions are more specifically described in the Merger Agreement, which we filed as Exhibit 2.1 to the Company\u2019s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on January 22, 2018.\nWe intend to pursue all required approvals in accordance with the Merger Agreement. However, no assurance can be given that the required approvals will be obtained and, even if all such approvals are obtained, no assurance can be given as to the terms, conditions and timing of the approvals or that they will satisfy the terms of the Merger Agreement. In addition, there can be no assurances that our stockholders will tender their shares, or that any or all of the other conditions will be satisfied.\nThe announcement of the Offer and the Merger could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations or our stock price.\nOur announcement of having entered into the Merger Agreement and Sanofi and Merger Sub\u2019s commencement of the Offer could cause a material disruption to our business and there can be no assurance that the conditions to the completion of the Offer and the Merger will be satisfied. The Merger Agreement may also be terminated by us or Sanofi in certain specified circumstances, including, subject to compliance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, by us in order to accept a third-party acquisition proposal that our board of directors determines constitutes a superior proposal upon payment of a termination fee to Sanofi of $326.0 million. We are subject to several risks as a result of the announcement of the Merger Agreement and the Offer, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, we are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the consummation of the Merger, which restrictions could adversely affect our ability to realize certain of our business strategies or take advantage of certain business opportunities;\n\u00b7\nThird parties may determine to delay or defer purchase decisions with regard to our products or terminate and/or attempt to renegotiate their relationships with us as a result of the Offer and Merger, whether pursuant to the terms of their existing agreements with us or otherwise;\n\u00b7\nThe attention of our management may be directed toward the consummation of the Offer, the Merger and related matters, and their focus may be diverted from the day-to-day business operations of our company, including from other opportunities that might otherwise be beneficial to us;\n\u00b7\nCurrent and prospective employees may experience uncertainty regarding their future roles with us (and, if the Offer is completed, Sanofi), which might adversely affect our ability to retain, recruit and motivate key personnel and may adversely affect the focus of our employees on development and sales of our products; and\n\u00b7\nOur inability to hire capable employees, given the uncertainty regarding the future of the company, in order to execute on our continuing business operations.\n\u00b7\nAny of the above matters could adversely affect our stock price or harm our financial condition, results of operations or business prospects.\nAny of the above matters could adversely affect our stock price or harm our financial condition, results of operations or business prospects.\nIf the proposed transactions are not consummated, our business and stock price could be adversely affected.\nThe consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the \u201cTransactions\u201d) is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. If the Offer and/or the Merger are delayed or otherwise not consummated, we could suffer a number of consequences that may adversely affect our business, results of operations and stock price, including the following:\n\u00b7\nif the Offer and the Merger are not completed, the trading price of the Company Shares may change to the extent that the current trading price of the Company Shares reflects an assumption that the Offer and the Merger will be completed;\n\u00b7\nwe have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant expenses related to the proposed Transactions. These transaction -related expenses include certain investment banking fees, legal, accounting and other professional fees. These fees must be paid even if the Offer is not consummated;\n\u00b7\nwe could be obligated to pay (or cause to be paid) to Sanofi a $326.0 million termination fee in connection with the termination of the Merger Agreement in certain circumstances;\n\u00b7\nfailure of the Offer and the Merger may result in negative publicity and/or a negative impression of us in our customers, prospective customers, the investment community or business community generally. The failure to consummate the Transactions may be viewed as a poor reflection on our business or prospects;\n\u00b7\ncertain of our suppliers, customers, distributors, and other business, collaboration and strategic partners may seek to change or terminate their relationships with us as a result of the proposed Transactions; and\n\u00b7\nthe market price of our common stock may decline, particularly to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the proposed Offer and Merger will be completed.\nOur executive officers and directors may have interests that are different from, or in addition to, those of our stockholders generally.\nOur executive officers and directors may have interests in the Offer and Merger that are different from, or are in addition to, those of our stockholders generally. These interests include direct or indirect ownership of our common stock, stock options, and restricted stock units, and the receipt or potential receipt of change in control or other retention or severance payments in connection with the proposed transactions.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that could make it difficult for a third party to acquire us prior to the completion of the Offer and the Merger.\nThe Merger Agreement contains restrictions on our ability to obtain a third-party proposal for an acquisition of our company. These provisions include our agreement not to initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any discussions with third parties regarding other proposals to acquire us, as well as restrictions on our ability to respond to such proposals, subject to fulfillment of certain fiduciary requirements of our board of directors. The Merger Agreement also contains certain termination rights, including, under certain circumstances, a requirement for us to pay (or cause to be paid) to Sanofi a termination fee of $326.0 million.\nThese provisions might discourage an otherwise-interested third party from considering or proposing an acquisition of our company, even one that may be deemed of greater value to our stockholders than the Offer. Furthermore, even if a third party elects to propose an acquisition, the concept of a termination fee may result in that third-party\u2019s offering a lower value to our stockholders than such third party might otherwise have offered.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe are dependent on revenues from our products, ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX. If we or Sobi are unable to successfully commercialize ELOCTATE or ALPROLIX, our results of operations would be materially harmed.\nNet sales of ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX represent substantially all of our revenues, and this concentration makes us dependent on these two products. If we or our collaboration partner Sobi were to experience difficulty with the\ncommercialization of ELOCTATE or ALPROLIX, we could experience a significant reduction in revenue and may not be profitable.\nThe commercial success of ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX and our ability to generate revenues will depend on many factors, including the following:\n\u00b7\nthe effectiveness of our global commercial strategy for the marketing and sale of our products;\n\u00b7\nour ability to maintain our development and commercialization arrangements with Sobi;\n\u00b7\nour ability to demonstrate and differentiate the efficacy, safety and value of ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX;\n\u00b7\nour ability to maintain a positive reputation among hemophilia patients and in the hemophilia community;\n\u00b7\nthe introduction and success of competing products and technologies;\n\u00b7\nour ability to obtain and maintain adequate pricing, coverage or reimbursement for our products;\n\u00b7\nour ability to manufacture and supply product without interruption;\n\u00b7\nthe absence of adverse legal, administrative, regulatory or legislative developments; and\n\u00b7\nother factors described below in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control, and success in any one of these factors will not guarantee success in any of the others. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to generate revenue through the sale of ELOCTATE or ALPROLIX.\nIf our hemophilia products fail to compete effectively, our business and market position would suffer.\nDue to our dependence on sales of our hemophilia products, our business may be harmed if our products are unable to successfully compete in the hemophilia treatment market. The hemophilia treatment market is highly competitive. We compete in the marketing and sale of our products, and in the development of, and acquisition of rights to, new products and technologies.\nWe compete with biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies that have greater financial, technological and other resources than we do. One or more of our competitors may benefit from significantly greater sales and marketing capabilities, may develop products that are accepted more widely than ours or may receive patent protection that dominates, blocks or adversely affects our product development or business.\nOur ability to successfully compete with other hemophilia treatments may be adversely affected if our therapies are not regarded by patients, healthcare providers or payors as offering significant benefits and value as compared to other current treatments. If we fail to successfully educate the medical and scientific community about our products or if we fail to demonstrate that our products and technologies are differentiated from competing drugs, our business may be harmed.\nA number of companies, including some mid-to-large biopharmaceutical companies, such as Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Bayer AG, Novo Nordisk, CSL Ltd., Pfizer Inc., Roche Holding AG, Sanofi Genzyme and Shire Plc., currently market or are pursuing the development of products for the treatment of hemophilia. We are also aware of other extended half-life factor products as well as other new technologies, such as gene therapies, bi-specific antibodies and RNA interference technologies, that are in development and, if successfully developed and approved, would compete with ELOCTATE or ALPROLIX. New therapies and technologies have the potential to transform the standard of care for hemophilia patients, and our products may be unable to compete successfully with such new therapies and technologies that may be developed and marketed by other companies.\nOur reliance on third parties for our manufacturing and distribution processes increases the risk that we will not have available sufficient quantities of ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX, or that such quantities may not be available at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our commercialization efforts and materially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the commercial manufacture and distribution of ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX. Biogen is currently our sole manufacturer and supplier of ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX. Biogen also relies on third parties with respect to certain aspects of its manufacturing process, including certain sole sources of raw materials. We also rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to distribute our products, including global, regional, and specialty distribution and logistics providers.\nBiogen and other third party providers are independent entities subject to their own unique operational and financial risks that are outside of our control. Any of these third parties may not perform their obligations in a timely and cost-effective manner or in compliance with applicable regulations. A third party, for instance, may be unable or unwilling to increase production capacity commensurate with demand for our products. Finding alternative providers could take a significant amount of time and involve significant expense due to the specialized nature of these services.\nWe have entered into, and plan to enter into other agreements, with additional manufacturing partners. Establishing relationships with additional manufacturing partners could take a significant amount of time and involve significant expense. In the event we change manufacturing partners or the third parties providing raw materials, drug substance, drug product, fill finish, packaging, labeling and/or storage of our products, we may need to obtain approval from applicable regulatory authorities. Manufacturers are generally required to maintain compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, and other stringent requirements and are subject to inspections by the FDA and comparable agencies in other jurisdictions to confirm such compliance. These cGMP requirements and regulations are not prescriptive instructions on how to manufacture products, but rather a series of principles that must be observed during manufacturing; as a result, their implementation may not be clearly delineated and may present a challenging task as these regulatory requirements are complex, time-consuming and expensive. Moreover, as our current products are biologics, they require processing steps that are more difficult than those required for most chemical pharmaceuticals. Any delay, interruption or other issues that arise in the manufacture, fill-finish, packaging or storage of our products as a result of a failure of our facilities or the facilities or operations of third parties to pass any regulatory agency inspection could result in administrative sanctions by the FDA or other U.S. or non-U.S. regulatory agencies. Significant noncompliance could also result in the imposition of monetary penalties or other civil or criminal sanctions. We cannot be certain that we could reach agreement with alternative providers or that the FDA or other regulatory authorities would approve our use of alternative manufacturers or providers on a timely basis.\nAny adverse developments affecting our supply chain may result in development delays, shipment delays, inventory shortages, lot failures, product withdrawals or recalls or other interruptions in the commercial supply of our products and/or the timing of our clinical trials. In addition, loss or damage to a manufacturing facility or storage site due to a natural disaster or otherwise could adversely affect our ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of our products or to deliver products to meet customer demand or contractual requirements, any of which may result in a loss of revenue and other adverse business consequences. We may also have to take inventory write-offs and incur other charges and expenses for products that fail to meet specifications, undertake costly remediation efforts or seek more costly manufacturing alternatives. Such developments could increase our manufacturing or development costs, cause us to lose revenue or market share as patients and physicians turn to competing therapeutics, diminish our profitability or damage our reputation. Moreover, any failure of Biogen or other third party to supply ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX could cause us to breach our supply agreements to Sobi for these products, which may subject us to liability under those agreements and impair our relationship with Sobi.\nIssues with product quality or safety, including the perception of such issues, could negatively affect our business, subject us to regulatory or other actions and cause a loss of confidence in us or our products.\nOur success depends upon the quality and safety of our products. Even after a product is approved for marketing, new safety data may emerge from adverse event reports or post-marketing studies. Previously unknown risks and adverse effects of our products may also be discovered in connection with unapproved or off-label uses of our\nproducts. Additionally, global regulatory authorities, at their discretion, may review and raise new or additional questions related to approved product information. This could result in changes to the approved product prescribing information or to the product approval itself.\nA quality or safety issue, including the perception of such issues, may result in one or more adverse events such as:\n\u00b7\ninvestigations by regulatory authorities;\n\u00b7\nrefusal of a regulatory authority to grant approvals and licenses;\n\u00b7\nfines, suspension or withdrawal of existing regulatory approvals and licenses;\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on operations, including injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products;\n\u00b7\nrequirements for additional labeling or safety monitoring;\n\u00b7\nproduct liability;\n\u00b7\nadverse inspection reports, warning letters, product recalls or seizures;\n\u00b7\nmonetary, civil or criminal fines, sanctions; and\n\u00b7\ncostly litigation.\nAn inability to address any of these issues in an effective and timely manner may cause negative publicity, loss of physician and patient confidence in the company or its current or future products and may negatively impact physicians\u2019 decisions to prescribe our products. These issues could also result in liabilities, loss of revenue, material write-offs of inventory, withdrawal or voluntary recall of our products from the marketplace, delays or limitations in regulatory approvals, material impairments of intangible assets, goodwill and fixed assets, material restructuring charges, difficulty in successfully launching new products and other adverse impacts on our results of operations.\nOur inability to maintain adequate coverage, pricing or reimbursement for our products could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nSales of ELOCTATE and ALPROLIX are dependent, in large part, on the availability and extent of coverage, pricing and reimbursement from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. When a new biopharmaceutical product is approved, the availability of government and private insurance coverage for that product may be uncertain, as may be the pricing of the product and extent to which the product will be reimbursed. Failure to maintain adequate coverage, pricing or reimbursement for our products could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nPricing and reimbursement for our products may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nchanges in federal, state or foreign government regulations or private third party payors\u2019 reimbursement policies;\n\u00b7\npressure by employers on private health insurance plans to reduce costs;\n\u00b7\nconsolidation and increasing assertiveness of payors, including managed care organizations, health insurers, pharmacy benefit managers, government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations seeking price discounts or rebates in connection with the placement of our products on their formularies and, in some cases, imposing restrictions on access to, coverage of or pricing for particular drugs based on perceived value; and\n\u00b7\nthe influence of third party organizations advocating for discounted pricing with respect to our products.\nOur ability to set the price for our products can vary significantly from country to country and, as a result, so can the price of our products. For example, in some countries, pricing, coverage and level of reimbursement or funding of prescription drugs, are subject to governmental control, and we may be unable to timely or successfully negotiate coverage, pricing, and reimbursement on terms that are favorable to us. Further, we are subject to risks due to the tendering process required in certain countries, as well as the comparison of dose pricing of our products against other available treatments. If we are unable to demonstrate to healthcare providers and payors the value of our products, our products may not be accepted or we may not secure adequate prices in a particular country. Our inability to secure\nadequate prices in a particular country may limit the marketing of our products within that country, and may also adversely affect our ability to obtain acceptable prices in other markets. This may create the opportunity for third party cross-border trade or influence our decision to sell or not to sell a product in a particular country, thus adversely affecting our geographic expansion plans and revenues.\nPricing for therapies and other health care costs are under significant scrutiny in the markets in which our products are prescribed and continue to be subject to intense political and societal pressures, which we anticipate will continue and escalate. For example, there is significant discussion and proposed legislation in the U.S. designed to bring more transparency to drug pricing, review of relationships between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform around government program reimbursement methodologies. We cannot predict the extent to which our business may be affected by these or other potential future legislative or regulatory developments. However, future price controls or other changes in pricing regulation or negative publicity related to our product pricing or the pricing of pharmaceutical drugs generally could restrict the amount that we are able to charge, which would adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain adequate protection for our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, or if we are unable to avoid violation of the intellectual property or proprietary rights of others, we may be subject to liability, the operation of our business may be interrupted or our business or prospects may be otherwise harmed.\nOur commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and defend patent and other intellectual property rights that are important to the development, manufacture and commercialization of our products and product candidates. The degree of patent protection that will be afforded to our products and processes in the United States and in other important non-U.S. markets remains uncertain and is dependent upon the scope of protection decided upon by the patent offices, courts and lawmakers in those countries. We can provide no assurance that we will successfully obtain or preserve patent protection for the technologies incorporated into our products and processes, or that the scope of patent protection obtained will be sufficient to protect our commercial interests in all countries where we conduct business. If we cannot prevent others from exploiting our inventions, we will not derive the benefit from them that we currently expect.\nWe rely on third party licenses for certain aspects of our products and product candidates, including for the treatment of hemophilia and cold agglutinin disease. If an agreement with a third party was to be terminated or if we otherwise lost our rights to such technology, our ability to develop, manufacture and commercialize products and product candidates could be adversely affected, and could materially harm our business prospects.\nWe also rely on regulatory exclusivity for protection of our products. Implementation and enforcement of regulatory exclusivity varies widely from country to country. Failure to qualify for regulatory exclusivity, or failure to obtain or maintain the extent or duration of such protections that we expect for our products in each of these markets due to challenges, changes of interpretations in the law or otherwise, could affect the revenue for our products, our decision on whether to market our products in a particular country or countries or could otherwise have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nAdditionally, we rely in part on confidentiality and non-use agreements with our employees, consultants, collaborators and other business partners to protect our proprietary technology and processes. If any of these individuals or entities breaches their confidentiality, non-use or similar agreements with us, we may not have adequate remedies for that breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors and even patented by them. If that happens, the potential competitive advantages provided by our intellectual property may be adversely affected. We may then need to license such competing technologies, and we may not be able to obtain licenses on reasonable terms, if at all, which could cause material harm to our business. Moreover, to the extent that our employees, consultants, parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners use intellectual property owned by others in their work for the company, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.\nOur success also depends in part on our, and on the people with whom we collaborate and do business, not infringing patents and proprietary rights of others, and not breaching any licenses or other agreements that we or they\nhave entered into with regard to our technologies, products and business. We cannot be certain that patents have not or will not be issued to others that would block our ability to obtain patents or to operate our business as we would like or at all. There may be patents in some countries that, if valid and if we are unsuccessful in circumventing or acquiring rights to them, could block our ability to commercialize products in those countries. There also may be claims in patent applications filed in some countries that, if granted and valid, and if we are unable to circumvent or license them, could also block our ability to commercialize products or processes in those countries.\nLitigation and other disputes over intellectual property and other proprietary rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry is inherently costly and unpredictable.\nLitigation, interferences, oppositions, inter partes reviews or other proceedings are, and may in the future be, necessary in some instances to determine the validity and scope of certain of our proprietary rights, and in other instances to determine the validity, scope or non-infringement of certain patent rights claimed by third parties to be pertinent to the manufacture, use or sale of our products. Patent-related claims could include challenges to the scope and validity of our patents on products or processes as well as allegations that our products infringe patents held by competitors or others. We may also face challenges to regulatory or patent protections covering our products by manufacturers of biosimilars that may choose to launch or attempt to launch their products before the expiration of our regulatory or patent exclusivity.\nIn July 2017, we filed complaints in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware and the U.S. International Trade Commission (\u201cITC\u201d) against CSL Behring LLC, CSL Behring GmbH, and CSL Behring Recombinant Facility AG (\u201cCSL Behring\u201d), alleging that the use of Idelvion\u00ae, CSL Behring\u2019s [Coagulation Factor IX (Recombinant), Albumin Fusion Protein], infringes three of our U.S. patents. The District Court complaint seeks injunctive relief and damages. The District Court action was stayed pending final determination in the ITC. Our ITC complaint requested that the ITC issue a limited exclusion order and cease and desist orders covering CSL Behring\u2019s alleged infringing articles, and impose a bond for imports of such articles made during the applicable review period. On February 6, 2018, we filed a motion to terminate the ITC investigation in order to proceed without further delay in the District Court. Patent enforcement proceedings can be expensive and time consuming, with no assurance of success.\nThe disposition of claims or proceedings is unpredictable and, regardless of the merits or the outcome, may be protracted, expensive and distracting to management. Moreover, the disposition and outcome of any such claims or proceedings could, among other things:\n\u00b7\nadversely affect the validity and scope of our patent or other proprietary rights;\n\u00b7\nhinder our ability to manufacture, market and sell our products;\n\u00b7\nlead to attempts on the part of other parties to pursue similar claims;\n\u00b7\nforce us to redesign those products or processes that use any allegedly infringing or misappropriated technology, which may result in significant cost or delay to us, or which the redesign of could be technically infeasible;\n\u00b7\nrequire us to seek a license for the impacted product or technology and pay royalties; or\n\u00b7\nresult in the assessment of significant monetary damages against us that may exceed amounts, if any, accrued in our financial statements, including the possibility of treble damages in a patent case if a court finds us to have willfully infringed certain intellectual property rights.\nIn addition, payments under any licenses that we are able to obtain would reduce our profits derived from the covered products and services. Furthermore, many of our collaboration agreements, including with Sobi, require us to indemnify the collaboration parties for third party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the cost to us of any such claim. Any of these adverse effects may be material and, consequently, may adversely impact our cash flow, financial position and results of operations.\nOur presence in international markets subjects us to certain risks of doing business in such markets, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur presence in international markets subjects us to many risks that could adversely affect our business and revenues, such as:\n\u00b7\nthe inability to obtain necessary regulatory or pricing approvals of products in a timely manner;\n\u00b7\ntiming and complexity of local tendering processes;\n\u00b7\ndiffering local product preferences and product requirements;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties or delays in establishing commercial operations in countries where we have not previously operated;\n\u00b7\nchanges in medical reimbursement policies and programs;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in staffing and managing non-U.S. operations;\n\u00b7\nunexpected difficulties in establishing effective financial and other controls in non-US jurisdictions;\n\u00b7\nuncertainties regarding the collectability of accounts receivable;\n\u00b7\ndiffering and increased labor regulations, including non-U.S. work councils;\n\u00b7\nthe imposition of governmental controls;\n\u00b7\nless favorable intellectual property or other applicable laws;\n\u00b7\nincreasingly complex standards for complying with non-U.S. laws and regulations that may differ substantially from country to country and may conflict with corresponding U.S. laws and regulations;\n\u00b7\ngovernment involvement in funding health care in major overseas markets;\n\u00b7\nthe far-reaching anti-bribery and anti-corruption legislation in the United Kingdom and elsewhere, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, and the escalation of investigations and prosecutions pursuant to such laws;\n\u00b7\ncompliance with complex import and export control laws;\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on direct investments by non-U.S. entities and trade restrictions;\n\u00b7\ncompliance with complex local tax and regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7\ngreater political or economic instability; and\n\u00b7\nchanges in tax laws and tariffs.\nWe cannot guarantee that our efforts to initiate or expand sales in these markets will succeed. Some non-U.S. markets may be especially vulnerable to periods of financial instability or may have very limited resources to spend on health care. To successfully implement our strategy in non-U.S. markets, we must attract and retain qualified personnel or may be required to increase our reliance on third party distributors within those markets. In addition, many of the countries in emerging markets have currencies that fluctuate substantially. If such currencies devalue and we cannot offset the devaluations, our financial performance within those countries could be adversely affected. In addition, price and currency exchange controls, limitations on participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization and other governmental actions could affect our business and results of operations in these markets.\nIn addition, our non-U.S. operations are subject to regulation under U.S. law. For example, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad. In many countries, the health care professionals we regularly interact with may meet the definition of a foreign government official for purposes of the FCPA. Failure to comply with U.S. or non-U.S. laws could result in various adverse consequences, including: possible delay in approval or refusal to approve a product; recalls, seizures or withdrawal of an approved product from the market; disruption in the supply or availability of our products or suspension of export or import privileges; the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions; the prosecution of executives overseeing our international operations; and damage to our reputation. Any significant impairment of our ability to sell products outside of the U.S. could adversely impact our business and financial results.\nDevelopment of our product candidates is expensive and uncertain. If we are unable to successfully develop and test our product candidates, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects will be harmed.\nA part of our business strategy is the continued development and support of our marketed products and our product pipeline programs. Clinical trials and the research and development of drug treatments are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties and requires significant capital expenditures and management resources. Only a small percentage of product candidates that enter the development process ever receive regulatory approval. The process of conducting the preclinical and clinical testing required to establish safety and efficacy and obtain regulatory approval is expensive and uncertain and takes many years. The FDA and non-U.S. regulatory agencies generally require pre-clinical (animal) testing as well as multiple stages of clinical (human) testing before a product gains regulatory approval, and failure may occur at any stage of testing. It is possible that positive results in a trial may not be replicated in subsequent or confirmatory trials, and success in preclinical work or early stage clinical trials does not ensure that later stage or larger scale clinical trials will be successful or that regulatory approval will be obtained.\nOur ability to commence and complete clinical trials may be delayed, and our existing trials may be stopped, due to various factors, including:\n\u00b7\nongoing discussions with the FDA or comparable foreign authorities regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials and the number of clinical trials we must conduct;\n\u00b7\ndelays in enrolling volunteers or patients into clinical trials, including as a result of low numbers and types of patients that meet eligibility criteria for each study;\n\u00b7\nlower than anticipated retention rate of volunteers or patients in clinical trials;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty in maintaining contact with patients after treatment, resulting in incomplete data, unforeseen safety issues or side effects;\n\u00b7\nthe need to repeat clinical trials as a result of inconclusive results, unforeseen complications in testing or clinical investigator errors;\n\u00b7\ninadequate supply or deficient quality of drug candidate materials or other materials necessary for the conduct of our clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nunfavorable FDA or foreign regulatory authority inspection and review of a manufacturing facility that supplied clinical trial materials or its relevant manufacturing records or a clinical trial site or records of any clinical or preclinical investigation;\n\u00b7\nvarying interpretations of clinical trial data;\n\u00b7\npoor or unanticipated effectiveness of product candidates, or adverse or unexpected safety events or side effects experienced by participants in our clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nfavorable results in testing of our competitors\u2019 product candidates, or FDA or foreign regulatory authority approval of our competitors\u2019 product candidates; or\n\u00b7\nother government or regulatory delays.\nThe occurrence of any of these events could result in significant costs and expenses and lost market opportunities, and could result in failure of a regulatory agency to grant approval of a product candidate in a timely manner, or at all.\nOur product research and development efforts may be harmed if the third parties on whom we rely fail to perform satisfactorily.\nOur reliance on third parties for aspects of the research and development process subjects our product research and development efforts to risk of failure or delay if such third parties do not perform satisfactorily. For example, we rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to store and distribute drug supplies for our clinical trials as well as contract research organizations (CROs), clinical data management organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators to conduct and manage our preclinical and clinical trials and to accurately report their results. Reduced control over these activities may impact our ability to control the timing, conduct, expense, reliability and quality of our clinical trials, but does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibility for trials that we sponsor. For example, we remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan\nand protocols for the trial as well as regulatory standards such as current cGCPs. Failure to fully comply with the study protocol or applicable regulations or regulatory standards could result in the clinical data generated in those studies being deemed unreliable. This failure may also result in the rejection of our product candidates by the FDA or a non-U.S. regulatory agency, or may result in our having to conduct additional audits or require additional clinical studies, which would delay our development programs, require us to incur additional costs and could substantially harm our business and financial condition. If the third parties we rely on for research and development activities do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, do not meet expected deadlines, experience work stoppages, terminate their agreements with us, need to be replaced or do not conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols, we may need to enter into new arrangements with alternative third parties, which could be difficult, costly or impossible. As a result, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed, terminated or may need to be repeated.\nWe also rely on third party contract manufacturers and suppliers for the materials we require for our clinical trials. Reliance on third parties for manufacturing and supply of materials for our clinical trials subject us to risks similar to those we face due to our reliance on third parties for manufacturing of our commercial products. If we suffer any manufacturing or supply disruptions, due to among other things, shortages in product raw materials, labor or technical difficulties, regulatory inspections or restrictions, shipping or customs delays or any other performance failure by any third party manufacturer on which we rely, our clinical trials may be adversely affected, including the timing and completion of the trials.\nThe occurrence of any of these events could result in significant costs and expenses and lost market opportunities, and could result in failure of a regulatory agency to grant approval of a product candidate in a timely manner, or at all.\nIf our business development activities are unsuccessful, our business could suffer and our financial performance could be adversely affected.\nWe have engaged and intend to continue to engage in business development activities, including evaluating potential acquisitions, strategic alliances, collaborations, technology licensing arrangements and other opportunities. An example of these activities includes our recent acquisition of True North Therapeutics (now known as Bioverativ USA Inc.), through which we acquired rights to BIVV009, a monoclonal antibody in development for cold agglutinin disease, a rare and chronic autoimmune hemolytic condition that often leads to severe anemia.\nOur business development activities may require a substantial investment of our resources, with no certainty of success. Further, our success in developing products or expanding our product portfolio from such business development activities will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nour ability to find suitable opportunities for acquisition, investment or alliance;\n\u00b7\nour ability to successfully complete due diligence processes and identify material contingencies, challenges or liabilities of a target company, compound, product or technology;\n\u00b7\nwhether we are able to complete an acquisition, investment or alliance on terms that are satisfactory to us;\n\u00b7\nthe strength of the technology and products being licensed or acquired;\n\u00b7\nany intellectual property and litigation related to these products or technology;\n\u00b7\nour ability to successfully integrate the acquired company, personnel, business, product, technology or research into our existing operations, including the ability to adequately fund, develop and commercialize acquired in-process research and development projects and to maintain adequate controls over the consolidated operations;\n\u00b7\nour ability to enter into markets or disease areas in which we have no or limited prior experience or where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions; and\n\u00b7\nour ability to access capital markets or incur indebtedness at terms that are satisfactory to us.\nIf we are unsuccessful in our business development activities, we may be unable to grow or meet our financial targets and our business and financial performance could be adversely affected.\nFurther, even if we are able to successfully identify and complete acquisitions and other strategic alliances, licenses and collaborations, we may face unanticipated costs or liabilities in connection with the transaction or we may not be able to integrate them or take full advantage of them or otherwise realize the benefits that we expect.\nWe depend on relationships with collaborators and other third parties for revenue, and for the development, regulatory approval, commercialization and marketing of certain products, which are outside our full control. If our collaborative efforts are unsuccessful, our commercialization strategies or product development may be delayed, which could have an adverse impact on our business, prospects and results of operations.\nWe rely, and expect to continue to rely, on a number of significant collaborative and other third party relationships for revenue, and for the development, regulatory approval, commercialization and marketing of our products and product candidates. These third parties may include other biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies, academic and research institutions, governments and government agencies and other public and private research organizations. For example, in addition to our collaboration with Sobi, we are pursuing programs with other third parties in hemophilia using different technologies, including XTEN technology, gene therapy, gene editing, and non-factor modalities. We also work with third parties to develop products and product candidates in other rare blood disorders.\nReliance on collaborative and other third party relationships subjects us to a number of risks, including:\n\u00b7\nwe may be unable to control the resources our collaborator devotes to our programs or product candidates;\n\u00b7\ndisputes may arise with respect to ownership of rights to technology developed with our collaborator, and the underlying contract with our collaborator may fail to provide us with significant protection or may fail to be effectively enforced if the collaborator fails to perform;\n\u00b7\nour collaborators\u2019 interests may not always be aligned with our interests and a collaborator may not pursue regulatory approvals or market a product in the same manner or to the same extent that we would, which could adversely affect our revenues;\n\u00b7\nthe failure to effectively cooperate with our collaborators could adversely affect product sales or the clinical development or regulatory approvals of product candidates under joint control and could also result in termination of the research, development or commercialization of product candidates, litigation or arbitration; and\n\u00b7\nany failure on the part of our collaborator to comply with applicable laws and regulatory requirements in the marketing, sale and maintenance of the market authorization of our products or to fulfill any responsibilities our collaborator may have to protect and enforce any intellectual property rights underlying our products or product candidates could have an adverse effect on our revenues and involve us in legal proceedings.\nGiven these risks, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the success of our current and future collaborative efforts. If these efforts fail, our product development or commercialization of new products could be delayed or revenues from products could decline.\nWe may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us.\nWe may need to raise additional capital to supplement our existing funds and cash generated from operations for working capital, capital expenditures, and strategic investments. Funding needs may shift and the amount of capital we may need depends on many factors, such as the cost of any new acquisition or collaborative, licensing or other commercial relationships that we may establish, and the progress, timing and scope of our research and development. The capital and credit markets can be volatile and, as a result, we may not receive additional funding when we need it or funding may only be available on unfavorable terms.\nIf we or third parties with whom we do business fail to comply with the extensive legal and regulatory requirements affecting the health care industry, we could face increased costs, penalties and harm to our business.\nOur activities, and the activities of our collaborators, distributors and other third party providers, are subject to extensive government regulation and oversight both in the U.S. and in non-U.S. jurisdictions.\nTo be approved for marketing, a potential product must undergo lengthy and rigorous testing and other extensive, costly and time-consuming procedures mandated by the FDA and non-U.S. regulatory authorities. Satisfaction of these regulatory requirements typically takes many years. Moreover, regulatory oversight continues to apply after product marketing approval and covers, among other things, testing, manufacturing, distribution, quality control, labeling, advertising, promotion, risk mitigation and adverse event reporting requirements. Our facilities, or those of third parties on which we rely, must be licensed prior to production and remain subject to inspection from time to time thereafter. Separately, if previously unknown problems occur with regard to our marketed products, any of our products may have to be withdrawn from the market or subject to restrictions. Regulatory agencies may also require additional clinical trials or testing for our products, and our products may be recalled or may be subject to reformulation, changes in labeling, warnings to the public and negative publicity.\nFurther, even if we are successful in gaining regulatory approval of any of our product candidates, the extent to which we are able to commercialize the product may be less than we anticipate. Regulatory authorities may grant marketing approval that is more restricted than anticipated. These restrictions may include limiting indications to narrow patient populations and imposing safety monitoring, educational requirements and risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (REMS). In addition, if we seek to expand or change the use of any of our marketed products, those changes may be subject to vigorous review and include multiple regulatory submissions, and approvals are not certain.\nIn addition to FDA and related regulatory requirements, we are subject to health care \u201cfraud and abuse\u201d laws governing our interactions in the U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions with physicians or other health care providers that prescribe or purchase our products. In the United States, these laws include the federal False Claims Act, the anti-kickback provisions of the federal Social Security Act, the Physician Payment Sunshine provisions, and other state and federal laws and regulations. In both the United States and other jurisdictions, health care companies such as ours are facing heightened scrutiny of their relationships with health care providers from anti-corruption enforcement officials and private individuals. Many biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies have been the target of lawsuits and investigations alleging violations of government regulation, including claims asserting submission of incorrect pricing information, impermissible off-label promotion of biotechnology and biopharmaceutical products, payments intended to influence the referral of health care business, submission of false claims for government reimbursement, antitrust violations or violations related to environmental matters. There also recently has been enhanced scrutiny of company-sponsored patient assistance programs, including insurance premium and co-pay assistance programs and donations to third party charities that provide such assistance. If we, or our vendors or donation recipients, fail to comply with relevant laws, regulations or government guidance in the operation of these programs, we could be subject to significant fines or penalties. Our risks under health care fraud and abuse laws may be heightened as we continue to expand our global operations and if we enter new therapeutic areas with different patient populations, which may have product distribution methods distinct from those we currently utilize.\nViolations of governmental regulation, such as a failed inspection or a failure in our adverse event reporting system, or any health care fraud and abuse law may be punishable by criminal, civil and administrative sanctions against us as well as against executives overseeing our business. These may include adverse inspection reports; refusal to grant approvals or licenses; warning letters; fines and civil monetary penalties; withdrawal of regulatory approval or licenses; interruption of production; operating restrictions; product recall or seizure; injunctions; criminal prosecution and exclusion from participation in government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, as well as against executives overseeing our business. In addition to penalties for violation of laws and regulations, we could be required to repay amounts we received from government payors, or pay additional rebates and interest if we are found to have miscalculated the pricing information we have submitted to the government. We cannot ensure that our compliance controls, policies and procedures will, in every instance, protect us from acts committed by our employees, collaborators, partners or third party providers that would violate the laws or regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Whether or not we have complied with the law, an investigation into alleged unlawful conduct could increase our expenses, damage our reputation, divert management time and attention and adversely affect our business. Any of these actions could cause a loss of confidence in us and our products, which could adversely affect our sales. Even if it is later determined that we are not in violation of these laws, we may be faced with negative publicity, incur significant expenses defending our position and have to divert significant management resources from other matters.\nOur business and results of operations may be adversely affected by current and potential future health care reforms.\nIn the United States, federal and state legislatures, health agencies and third party payors continue to focus on containing the cost of health care. Legislative and regulatory proposals and enactments to reform health care insurance programs could significantly influence the manner in which our products are prescribed and purchased. We continue to face uncertainties as a result of federal and administrative efforts to repeal, substantially modify or invalidate or replace some or all of the provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). There is no assurance that the PPACA, as currently enacted or as amended or replaced in the future, will not adversely affect our business and financial results, and we cannot predict how future federal or state legislative or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform will affect our business.\nThere is also significant economic pressure on U.S. state budgets that may result in states increasingly seeking to achieve budget savings through mechanisms that limit coverage or payment for our drugs. Some states have considered legislation and ballot initiatives that would control the prices of drugs, including laws to allow importation of biotechnology and biopharmaceutical products from lower cost jurisdictions outside of the United States and laws intended to impose price controls on state drug purchases. State Medicaid programs are increasingly requesting manufacturers pay supplemental rebates and requiring prior authorization by the state program for use of any drug for which supplemental rebates are not paid. Government efforts to reduce Medicaid expenses may lead to increased use of managed care organizations by Medicaid programs. This may result in managed care organizations influencing prescription decisions for a larger segment of the population and a corresponding constraint on prices and reimbursement for our products.\nIn the European Union and some other non-U.S. markets, the government provides health care at low cost to consumers and regulates biotechnology and biopharmaceutical prices, patient eligibility or reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored health care system. Many countries have announced or implemented measures to reduce health care costs to constrain their overall level of government expenditures. These measures vary by country and may include, among other things, patient access restrictions, suspensions on price increases, prospective and possibly retroactive price reductions and other recoupments and increased mandatory discounts or rebates, recoveries of past price increases and greater importation of drugs from lower-cost countries. These measures have negatively impacted our revenues and may continue to adversely affect our revenues and results of operations in the future.\nIf we fail to attract and retain key personnel, our business may suffer.\nOur success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our management team and other key employees. Operating as an independent company demands a significant amount of time and effort from our management and other employees and may give rise to increased employee turnover. If we lose the services of members of our management team or other key employees, we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives.\nOur ability to attract, recruit and retain such talent will depend on a number of factors, including the hiring practices of our competitors, the performance of our commercial products and pipeline programs, our compensation and benefits, work location and work environment and economic conditions affecting our industry generally, and, as described above, uncertainty as a result of the potential merger with Sanofi. If we cannot effectively hire and retain qualified employees, our business, results of operations and prospects could suffer.\nA breakdown or breach of our or third parties\u2019 technology systems could subject us to liability or interrupt the operation of our business.\nWe are increasingly dependent upon technology systems and data, many of which are new or unfamiliar systems. Our intellectual property, computer systems, other proprietary technology and other sensitive company data is potentially vulnerable to loss, damage or misappropriation from system malfunction, computer viruses, unauthorized access to data or misappropriation or misuse thereof by those with permitted access and other events. Likewise, data privacy or security breaches by individuals authorized to access our technology systems or others may pose a risk that sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information belonging to us, our patients,\ncustomers or other business partners, may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. The increasing use and evolution of technology, including cloud-based computing, creates additional opportunities for the unintentional dissemination of information and the intentional destruction of confidential information stored in the company\u2019s systems or in non-encrypted portable media or storage devices. Cyber attacks continue to increase in their frequency, sophistication and intensity. While we believe we take appropriate security measures to reduce these risks to our intellectual property, data and information technology systems, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns, breaches, cyber incidents or other events. Such events could have a negative effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations. Further, the misappropriation or other loss of our intellectual property from any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our competitive position and may cause us to incur substantial litigation costs.\nOur business involves environmental risks, which include the cost of compliance and the risk of contamination or injury, which could harm our business.\nOur business and the business of several of our third party contractors involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals, biologics and radioactive compounds. Although we believe that our and their safety procedures for the handling and disposing of such materials comply with state, federal and non-U.S. laws and standards, there will always be the risk of accidental contamination or injury. If we were to become liable for an accident, or if a facility in which our products or product candidates were manufactured suffered an extended shutdown, we could incur significant costs, damages or penalties that could harm our business. Manufacturing, distribution and disposal of our products and product candidates also requires compliance with environmental laws and may require permits from government agencies, including governmental authorizations or permits for water supply, wastewater discharge and waste disposal. If we or our contract parties do not obtain or comply with appropriate permits and other requirements of environmental laws, we or they could incur significant penalties and other costs and limits on manufacturing volumes that could harm our business.\nSignificant legal proceedings may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe are subject to the risk of litigation, derivative claims, securities class actions, regulatory and governmental investigations and other proceedings, including proceedings arising from investor dissatisfaction with us or our performance. If any claims were brought against us and resulted in a finding of substantial legal liability, the finding could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations or cause significant reputational harm to us, which could seriously adversely impact our business. Allegations of improper conduct by private litigants or regulators, regardless of veracity, may harm our reputation and adversely impact our ability to grow our business.\nRisks Related to the Separation\nWe face a number of risks as a standalone, independent public company following our separation from Biogen.\nPrior to our separation from Biogen in February 2017, we were fully part of Biogen\u2019s organizational structure, including from an operational and financial perspective. Following the separation, we have worked to develop our own systems, processes and operations, though we continue to rely on Biogen for certain activities. As a result of the separation, we remain subject to risks as a standalone, independent public company. These risks include the following:\n\u00b7\nWe may not achieve all the benefits we expect as a standalone company and we may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than we would have if we were still part of Biogen\u2019s organizational structure, particularly because we may lack Biogen\u2019s operating diversity, purchasing power, integrated strategies with Biogen\u2019s other businesses, access to capital markets, market reputation, performance and brand identity. If we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as an independent company, or do not achieve them in the time we expect, our business, operating results, financial condition or prospects may suffer.\n\u00b7\nWe may be unable to make, on a timely or cost-effective basis, the changes necessary to operate as a standalone company, and we remain reliant on Biogen for the provision of certain transition, manufacturing and supply services. If Biogen is unable or unwilling to satisfy its obligations to provide us with certain services under our agreements with them, we could incur operational difficulties or losses that could have a material and adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Furthermore, Biogen is only obligated to provide certain services for a limited period of time from the separation. If we do not have in place our own systems and services, or if we do not have agreements with other providers to provide these services in a timely manner or on terms and conditions as favorable as those we receive from Biogen, we may not be able to operate our business effectively and our profitability may decline. Additionally, if we fail to obtain the quality of services necessary to operate effectively or incur greater costs in obtaining these services, our profitability, operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\n\u00b7\nOur historical financial information for periods prior to the separation is not necessarily representative of the results that we would have achieved as a separate, publicly traded company and should not be relied upon as an indicator of our future results. Periods prior to the separation reflect shared economies of scope and scale in costs, employees, vendor relationships and customer relationships with Biogen. Although we entered into certain agreements with Biogen in connection with the separation, these arrangements were entered into in the context of the separation while we were still controlled by Biogen and may not reflect terms that would have resulted from negotiations between unaffiliated third parties. These arrangements may also not fully capture the benefits that we have enjoyed as a result of being integrated with Biogen and may result in us incurring higher costs than in the past, and we may lose certain synergies and benefits we enjoyed as a result of being a part of Biogen, such as access to sufficient working capital for general corporate purposes as well as acquisitions, investments and capital expenditures. In addition, being a part of Biogen enabled us to leverage Biogen\u2019s technological capabilities, data and commerce platforms. After the separation, our cost of capital may be higher than Biogen\u2019s cost of capital prior to the separation. We may also face other significant changes in our cost structure, management, financing and business operations as a result of operating as a company separate from Biogen.\n\u00b7\nThe separation may result in disruptions to, and negatively impact our relationships with, our customers and other business partners. Specifically, uncertainty related to the separation may lead customers and other parties with which we currently do business or may do business in the future to terminate or attempt to negotiate changes in our existing business relationships, or cause them to delay entering into business relationships with us or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than us. The effect of such disruptions could be exacerbated by any delays in the transition following the separation.\n\u00b7\nWe have implemented numerous financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures, and added accounting, finance and information technology staff to assist us in meeting our financial reporting and other requirements to which we are now subject. These requirements include, among other things, our annual management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and a report by our independent registered public accounting firm addressing these assessments. These and other obligations have placed significant demands on our management, administrative and operational resources, including accounting and information technology resources. If we fail to successfully implement our systems and controls, our ability to comply with our financial reporting requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies could be impaired and our business could be harmed.\n\u00b7\nUpon completion of the separation, Biogen received an opinion from its tax counsel that the distribution qualified as a tax-free distribution for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The opinion of tax counsel is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service or any court, and the Internal Revenue Service could determine on audit that the distribution is taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the distribution does not qualify as a transaction that is tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Biogen and its stockholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Under our agreements with Biogen, we could be required to indemnify Biogen for material taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax matters agreement. If we are required to indemnify Biogen under the circumstances set forth in the tax matters agreement, we may be subject to substantial liabilities, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition.\n\u00b7\nFollowing the separation from Biogen, we remain subject to numerous restrictions to preserve the tax-free treatment of the separation transactions in the U.S., which may reduce our strategic and operating flexibility. More specifically, even if the distribution otherwise qualifies for tax-free treatment, the distribution may result in corporate-level taxable gain to Biogen under Section 355(e) of the Code if 50% or more, by vote or value, of shares of our stock or Biogen\u2019s stock are acquired or issued as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the distribution. The process for determining whether an acquisition or issuance triggering these provisions has occurred is complex, inherently factual and subject to interpretation of the facts and circumstances of a particular case. Any acquisitions or issuances of our stock or Biogen\u2019s stock within a two-year period after the distribution generally are presumed to be part of such a plan, although we or Biogen, as applicable, may be able to rebut that presumption. Accordingly, under the tax matters agreement we entered into with Biogen, for the two-year period following the distribution, we are prohibited, except in certain circumstances, from:\n\u00b7\nentering into any transactions resulting in the acquisition of 40% or more of our stock or substantially all of our assets, whether by merger or otherwise;\n\u00b7\nmerging, consolidating or liquidating;\n\u00b7\nissuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds;\n\u00b7\nrepurchasing our capital stock; or\n\u00b7\nceasing to actively conduct our business.\nThese restrictions may limit our ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or other transactions that we may believe to otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders or that might increase the value of our business. In addition, under the tax matters agreement, we will be required to indemnify Biogen against any such tax liabilities as a result of the acquisition of our stock or assets, even if we do not participate in or otherwise facilitate the acquisition. In connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger, we entered into a letter agreement with Biogen and Sanofi to waive provisions under the Tax Matters Agreement that would have otherwise prohibited us from entering into the Merger Agreement. Further, so long as we receive the tax opinion referenced in the letter agreement, Biogen has agreed to waive the restrictions as they apply to the consummation of the Merger. See also the risks described under the heading \u201c-Risks Related to the Merger\u201d.\n\u00b7\nAfter the distribution, there are several significant areas where the liabilities of Biogen may become our obligations, including contingent tax related liabilities of Biogen. For example, under the tax matters agreement we entered into with Biogen, if Biogen were unable to pay any prior period taxes for which it is responsible, under applicable law we could be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes, and such amounts could be significant. Other provisions of federal, state, local or foreign law may establish similar liability for other matters, including laws governing tax-qualified pension plans, as well as other contingent liabilities.\n\u00b7\nPursuant to the separation agreement and certain other agreements we entered into with Biogen, we assumed and agreed to indemnify Biogen for certain liabilities for uncapped amounts, which may include, among other items, associated defense costs, settlement amounts and judgments. Payments pursuant to these indemnities may be significant and could negatively impact our business, particularly indemnities relating to our actions that could impact the tax-free nature of the distribution and certain related transactions.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe market price for our common stock may fluctuate widely.\nThe market price of our shares of common stock may fluctuate widely, depending upon many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u00b7\ncompletion of the Merger with Sanofi, as described above under the heading \u201c-Risks Related to the Merger\u201d;\n\u00b7\nour quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other comparable companies;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u00b7\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u00b7\ndevelopments in our pipeline or the pipeline of competitors;\n\u00b7\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant clinical trial results or regulatory approvals, investments, acquisitions or dispositions;\n\u00b7\nthe failure of securities analysts to cover our shares of common stock;\n\u00b7\nchanges in ratings or earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;\n\u00b7\nthe operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies;\n\u00b7\noverall market fluctuations; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic conditions.\nStock markets in general often experience volatility that is unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our shares of common stock. You may not be able to resell your shares of common stock following periods of volatility because of the market\u2019s adverse reaction to volatility. When the market price of a company\u2019s common stock drops significantly, stockholders often institute securities class action lawsuits against the company. This type of lawsuit against us could cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of management and other resources.\nYour percentage ownership in the company may be diluted in the future.\nIn the future, your percentage ownership in the company may be diluted because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions or otherwise, including equity awards that we grant to our directors, officers and employees. Such awards will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. From time to time, we issue stock options or other share-based awards to employees under our employee benefits plans.\nIn addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over the company\u2019s common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as the board of directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. For example, we could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.\nWe do not expect to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Consequently, stockholders must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on the value of their shares of our common stock.\nProvisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain certain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors. For example, our corporate governance documents include provisions:\n\u00b7\nauthorizing blank check preferred stock, which could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock;\n\u00b7\nlimiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;\n\u00b7\nlimiting the ability of our stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings;\n\u00b7\neliminating the ability of our stockholders to act by written consent in lieu of a meeting;\n\u00b7\nrequiring advance notice of stockholder proposals for business to be conducted at meetings of our stockholders and for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors; and\n\u00b7\nlimiting the determination of the number of directors on our board of directors and the filling of newly created seats on the board to our board of directors then in office.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay hostile takeovers and changes in control of our company or changes in our management.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL), which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock. Any provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nIn addition, an acquisition or further issuance of our stock could trigger the application of Section 355(e) of the Code. Under the tax matters agreement we entered into with Biogen in connection with the separation, we would be required to indemnify Biogen for any resulting taxes, and this indemnity obligation might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control that our stockholders may consider favorable. In connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger, we entered into a letter agreement with Biogen and Sanofi to waive provisions under the Tax Matters Agreement that would have otherwise prohibited us from entering into the Merger Agreement. Further, so long as we receive the tax opinion referenced in the letter agreement, Biogen has agreed to waive the restrictions as they apply to the consummation of the Merger. See also the risks described under the heading \u201c-Risks Related to the Merger\u201d.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the state courts of the State of Delaware, or, if no state court located in the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal court for the District of Delaware, as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could discourage lawsuits against us and our directors and officers.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, to the fullest extent permitted by law, will be the sole and exclusive forum for:\n\u00b7\nany derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of us;\n\u00b7\nany action asserting a claim for breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees of the company to us or our stockholders;\n\u00b7\nany action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL; or\n\u00b7\nany action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine under Delaware state corporate law.\nThis exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholders find favorable for disputes with us or our directors or officers, which may discourage such lawsuits against the company and our directors and officers. Alternatively, if a court outside of Delaware were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.", "PERMNO": 16544, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "BIVV"}
