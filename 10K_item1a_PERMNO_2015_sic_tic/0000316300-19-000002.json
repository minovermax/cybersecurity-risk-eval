{"cik": "316300", "company": "EXCO RESOURCES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nThe risk factors noted in this section and other factors noted throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including those risks identified in \u201cItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d describe examples of risks, uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement.\nIf one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual outcomes may vary materially from those included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Relating to Our Restructuring\nWe have filed voluntary petitions for relief under the Bankruptcy Code and are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with bankruptcy cases.\nOn January 15, 2018, the Company and the Filing Subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Our business and operations will be subject to various risks for the duration of the Chapter 11 proceedings, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nour ability to continue as a going concern;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop, file and consummate a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain Court, creditor and regulatory approval of a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain consents or waivers to further extend the DIP Facilities beyond the scheduled maturity date of May 22, 2019 or refinance the DIP Facilities if we are unable to consummate a plan of reorganization in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain Court approval with respect to motions in the Chapter 11 Cases and the outcomes of Court rulings and of the Chapter 11 Cases in general;\n\u2022\nthe ability of third parties to file motions in our Chapter 11 Cases, which may interfere with our business operations or our ability to propose and/or complete a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization;\n\u2022\nsignificant costs related to the Chapter 11 Cases and related litigation;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain and maintain normal payment and other terms with customers, vendors and service providers, as well as our ability to maintain contracts that are critical to our operations;\n\u2022\na loss of, or a disruption in the materials or services received from suppliers, contractors or service providers with whom we have commercial relationships;\n\u2022\npotential increased difficulty in retaining and motivating our key employees through the process of reorganization, and potential increased difficulty in attracting new employees;\n\u2022\nsignificant time and effort required to be spent by our senior management in dealing with the bankruptcy and restructuring activities rather than focusing exclusively on business operations; and\n\u2022\nour ability to fund and execute our business plan and our ability to obtain any necessary financing for our business on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe are also subject to risks and uncertainties with respect to the actions and decisions of creditors and other third parties who have interests in our Chapter 11 Cases that may be inconsistent with our plans. These risks and uncertainties could affect our business and operations in various ways and may significantly increase the duration of the Chapter 11 Cases. For example, negative events or publicity associated with the Chapter 11 Cases could adversely affect our relationships with our vendors and employees, as well as with customers, which in turn could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. Also,\npursuant to the Bankruptcy Code, we need Court approval for transactions outside the ordinary course of business, which may limit our ability to respond timely to events or take advantage of opportunities.\nBecause of the risks and uncertainties associated with the Chapter 11 Cases, we cannot predict or quantify the ultimate impact that events occurring during the Chapter 11 Cases may have on our business, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, nor can we predict the ultimate impact that events occurring during the Chapter 11 Cases may have on our corporate or capital structure.\nWe believe it is highly likely that our existing common shares will be canceled at the conclusion of our Chapter 11 proceedings.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness that is senior to our existing common shares in our capital structure. As a result, we believe it is highly likely that our existing common shares will be canceled at the conclusion of our Chapter 11 proceedings, and the holders of our existing common shares are not expected to be entitled to any recovery. The March 2019 Plan would result in our common shares being canceled, discharged, released and extinguished without the holders thereof receiving any distribution. As a result, any trading in our common shares during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases is highly speculative and poses substantial risks to purchasers of our common shares.\nOperating under Court protection for a long period of time may harm our business.\nOur future results are dependent upon the successful confirmation and implementation of a plan of reorganization. We have been operating under Court protection since our initial filing for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in January 2018, and this prolonged period of operations under Court protection has had, and is expected to continue to have, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. So long as the proceedings related to the Chapter 11 Cases continue, our senior management will be required to spend a significant amount of time and effort dealing with the reorganization instead of focusing exclusively on our business operations. A prolonged period of operating under Court protection also may make it more difficult to retain management and other key personnel necessary to the success and growth of our business. In addition, the longer the Chapter 11 Cases continue, the more likely it is that our customers and suppliers will lose confidence in our ability to reorganize our businesses successfully and seek to establish alternative commercial relationships.\nDuring the course of the Chapter 11 Cases, we have been required, and expect that we will continue to be required, to incur substantial costs for professional fees and other expenses associated with the administration of the Chapter 11 Cases. We have incurred $67.8 million in legal and professional fees related to the Chapter 11 Cases for the period from the Petition Date to December 31, 2018. Furthermore, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, significant costs and delays due to litigation during the Chapter 11 Cases. These fees and expenses have forced us to divert our capital resources away from capital expenditures to grow our business.\nDuring the pendency of the bankruptcy proceedings, our Liquidity will depend mainly on cash generated from operating activities and available funds under the DIP Credit Agreement. On January 22, 2018, we closed the DIP Credit Agreement providing for $250.0 million of debtor-in-possession financing. The proceeds from the DIP Facilities were used to refinance all obligations outstanding under the EXCO Resources Credit Agreement and are expected to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations during the Chapter 11 Cases. The DIP Facilities mature on May 22, 2019 and may not be sufficient to support our day-to-day operations in the event of a prolonged restructuring process and we may be required to seek additional debtor-in-possession financing to fund our operations. A further extension of the DIP Facilities beyond the scheduled maturity date would require a waiver or consent from the DIP Lenders. If we are required to seek additional financing, we may not be able to obtain such financing on favorable terms or at all. See further discussion regarding the impact of the maturity of the DIP Facilities in \"Item 1A. Risk Factors - We have substantial liquidity needs and may be required to seek additional financing if we experience a prolonged bankruptcy process. If we are unable to maintain adequate liquidity, we may not be able to obtain financing on satisfactory terms\". As a result, our chances of successfully reorganizing our business may be seriously jeopardized, the likelihood that we instead will be required to liquidate our assets may be enhanced, and, as a result, any claims and securities in the Debtors could become further devalued or become worthless.\nWe cannot predict the ultimate outcome for the liabilities that will be subject to a plan of reorganization. Even if a plan of reorganization is approved and implemented, our operating results may be adversely affected by the possible reluctance of prospective lenders and other counterparties to do business with a company that recently emerged from Chapter 11.\nWe are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with our exclusive right to file a plan of reorganization.\nAt the outset of the Chapter 11 proceedings, the Bankruptcy Code provides debtors-in-possession the exclusive right to file and solicit acceptance of a plan of reorganization for the first 120 days of the bankruptcy case, subject to extension at the discretion of the court. All other parties are prohibited from filing or soliciting a plan of reorganization during this period. Our initial filing exclusivity period was set to expire on May 15, 2018 and the solicitation exclusivity period was set to expire on July 14, 2018. The Court has approved multiple extensions to the filing exclusivity period and the solicitation exclusivity period. The most recent extensions were approved by the Court on February 15, 2019, which extended the filing exclusivity period through April 1, 2019 and the solicitation exclusivity period through May 31, 2019. If the Court terminates that right or the exclusivity period expires, there could be a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve confirmation of a plan in order to achieve our stated goals. The possible decision of creditors and/or other third parties, whose interest may be inconsistent with our own, to file alternative plans of reorganization could further protract the Chapter 11 proceedings, leading us to continue to incur significant professional fees and costs. Because of these risks and uncertainties associated with the termination or expiration of our exclusivity rights, we cannot predict or quantify the ultimate impact that events occurring during the Chapter 11 cases may have on our business, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, nor can we predict the ultimate impact that events occurring during the Chapter 11 cases may have on our corporate or capital structure.\nWe may not be able to obtain confirmation of a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization.\nTo emerge successfully from Court protection as a viable entity, we must meet certain statutory requirements with respect to a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization, including obtaining the requisite acceptances of such a plan, and certain other statutory conditions for confirmation of such a Chapter 11 plan, which have not occurred to date. We were not able to reach an agreement with our creditors for a plan of reorganization prior to commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases. Therefore, the outcome of our Chapter 11 process is subject to a high degree of uncertainty and is dependent upon factors outside of our control, including actions of the Court and our creditors.\nWe have not received consents from any creditors in support of the March 2019 Plan. Therefore, we may not receive the requisite acceptances to confirm the March 2019 Plan. Even if the requisite acceptances of a plan are received, the Court may not confirm such a plan. The precise requirements and evidentiary showing for confirming a plan, notwithstanding its rejection by one or more impaired classes of claims or equity interests, depends upon a number of factors including, without limitation, the status and seniority of the claims or equity interests in the rejecting class (i.e., secured claims or unsecured claims, subordinated or senior claims, or common shares).\nIf a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization is not ultimately confirmed by the Court, it is unclear whether we would be able to reorganize our business and what, if anything, holders of claims against us would ultimately receive with respect to their claims. Our creditors would likely incur significant costs in connection with developing and seeking approval of an alternative plan of reorganization, which might not be supported by any of the current debt holders, various statutory committees or other stakeholders. If we are unable to confirm the March 2019 Plan and an alternative reorganization could not be agreed upon, it is possible that we would have to liquidate our assets, in which case it is likely that holders of claims would receive substantially less favorable treatment than they would receive if we were to emerge as a viable, reorganized entity. There can be no assurance as to whether we will successfully reorganize and emerge from the Chapter 11 Cases or, if we do successfully reorganize, as to when we would emerge from the Chapter 11 Cases.\nAny plan of reorganization that we may implement will be based in large part upon assumptions and analyses developed by us. If these assumptions and analyses prove to be incorrect, or market conditions deteriorate, our plan may be unsuccessful in its execution.\nAny plan of reorganization that we may implement will affect both our capital structure and the ownership, structure and operation of our businesses and will reflect assumptions and analyses based on our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors that we consider appropriate under the circumstances. Whether actual future results and developments will be consistent with our expectations and assumptions depends on a number of factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nchanges in the price of oil and natural gas, including our increased exposure since none of our estimated future production is currently covered by commodity derivative contracts;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain adequate liquidity and financing sources, including acceptable terms for any new debt instruments contemplated by a plan of reorganization;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain the confidence of our vendors, customers and joint interest partners in our viability as a continuing entity and to attract and retain sufficient business with them;\n\u2022\nour ability to retain key employees; and\n\u2022\nthe overall strength and stability of general economic conditions of the financial and oil and gas industries, both in the U.S. and in global markets.\nAdverse changes in any of these factors could materially affect the successful reorganization of our businesses. Accordingly, any Chapter 11 plan of reorganization may not enable us to achieve our goals or continue as a going concern.\nIn addition, any plan of reorganization will rely upon financial projections, including with respect to revenues, EBITDA, capital expenditures, debt service and cash flow. Financial forecasts are necessarily speculative, and it is likely that one or more of the assumptions and estimates that are the basis of these financial forecasts will not be accurate. In our case, the forecasts will be even more speculative than normal, because they may involve fundamental changes in the nature of our capital structure. Accordingly, we expect that our actual financial condition and results of operations will differ, perhaps materially, from what we have anticipated. Consequently, there can be no assurance that the results or developments contemplated by any plan of reorganization we may implement will occur or, even if they do occur, that they will have the anticipated effects on us and our subsidiaries or our businesses or operations. The failure of any such results or developments to materialize as anticipated could materially adversely affect the successful execution of any plan of reorganization.\nEven if a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization is consummated, we will continue to face risks.\nEven if a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization is consummated, we will continue to face a number of risks, including certain risks that are beyond our control, such as further deterioration or other changes in economic conditions, changes in our industry, changes in prices for oil and natural gas and increasing expenses. Some of these concerns and effects typically become more acute when a case under the Bankruptcy Code continues for a protracted period without indication of how or when the case may be completed. As a result of these risks and others, there is no guaranty that any plan of reorganization will achieve our stated goals.\nFurthermore, even if our debts are reduced or discharged through a plan of reorganization, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing or other means to fund our business after the completion of the Chapter 11 process. Adequate funds may not be available when needed or may not be available on favorable terms.\nThe terms of our indebtedness include restrictions and financial covenants that may restrict our business and financing activities.\nThe availability of borrowings under the DIP Credit Agreement is essential to our ability to fund our operations during the Chapter 11 Cases. The DIP Credit Agreement includes certain affirmative and negative covenants, including, among other covenants customary in similar reserve-based credit facilities and debtor-in-possession financings, requirements to maintain a minimum level of liquidity and limit our aggregate disbursements to certain thresholds compared to the 13-week cash flow forecasts provided to the DIP Lenders. Our future ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants is uncertain and will be affected by the levels of cash flow from our operations, development activities and other events or circumstances beyond our control. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate, our ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. The DIP Facilities contain events of default, including: (i) conversion of the Chapter 11 Cases to cases under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code and (ii) appointment of a trustee, examiner or receiver in the Chapter 11 Cases.\nIf we violate any provisions of our such financing agreements that are not cured or waived within the appropriate time periods provided therein, a significant portion of our indebtedness may become immediately due and payable and our lenders\u2019 commitment to make further loans to us may terminate. We might not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments.\nWe have substantial liquidity needs and may be required to seek additional financing if we experience a prolonged bankruptcy process. If we are unable to maintain adequate liquidity, we may not be able to obtain financing on satisfactory terms.\nOur principal sources of Liquidity historically have been internally generated cash flows from operations, borrowings under certain credit agreements, issuances of debt securities, dispositions of non-strategic assets, joint ventures and capital markets when conditions are favorable. Our Liquidity, including our ability to meet our ongoing operational obligations, is dependent upon, among other things; (i) our ability to comply with the terms and conditions of any post-petition financing and cash collateral order entered by the Court in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, (ii) our ability to maintain adequate cash on\nhand, (iii) our ability to generate cash flow from operations, (iv) our ability to develop, confirm and consummate a Chapter 11 plan or other alternative restructuring transaction and (v) the cost, duration and outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases. Our ability to maintain adequate Liquidity depends in part upon industry conditions and general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors beyond our control.\nWe face uncertainty regarding the adequacy of our Liquidity and capital resources and have extremely limited, if any, access to additional financing. In addition to the cash requirement necessary to fund ongoing operations, we have incurred significant professional fees and other costs in connection with preparation for the Chapter 11 Cases and expect that we will continue to incur significant professional fees and costs throughout our Chapter 11 Cases. We cannot provide assurance that our Liquidity will be sufficient to continue to fund our operations and allow us to satisfy our obligations related to Chapter 11 Cases until we are able to emerge from our Chapter 11.\nThe DIP Facilities are currently set to mature on May 22, 2019. In order to repay the DIP Facilities at maturity, we currently expect that we would need to seek additional financing, sell assets, refinance or restructure the DIP Facilities prior to maturity or extend the maturity date of the DIP Facilities. We can provide no assurance that additional financing would be available or, if available, offered to us on acceptable terms. Our access to additional financing is, and for the foreseeable future will likely continue to be, extremely limited if it is available at all. Although we have previously extended the maturity date of the DIP Facilities, the DIP Lenders may not agree to any further extensions. Our ability to consummate the March 2019 Plan in a timely manner, if at all, is subject to significant risk since we have not received consents from any creditors in support of the March 2019 Plan. As a result, it is unlikely that we will be able to consummate a plan of reorganization prior to the maturity of the DIP Facilities. Therefore, our long-term liquidity and the adequacy of our capital resources are highly uncertain at this time.\nUpon emergence from bankruptcy, the composition of our board of directors will change significantly.\nThe composition of our board of directors is expected to change significantly following the Chapter 11 Cases. Any new directors may have different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives from those individuals who previously served on the board and, thus, may have different views on the issues that will determine the future of the Company. As a result, the future strategy and plans of the Company may differ materially from those of the past.\nIn certain instances, a Chapter 11 case may be converted to a case under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.\nUpon a showing of cause, the Court may convert our Chapter 11 Cases to cases under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. In such event, a Chapter 7 trustee would be appointed or elected to liquidate our assets for distribution in accordance with the priorities established by the Bankruptcy Code. We believe that liquidation under Chapter 7 would result in significantly smaller distributions being made to our creditors than those provided for in a Chapter 11 plan because of (i) the likelihood that the assets would have to be sold or otherwise disposed of in a distressed fashion over a short period of time rather than in a controlled manner and as a going concern, (ii) additional administrative expenses involved in the appointment of a Chapter 7 trustee and (iii) additional expenses and claims, some of which would be entitled to priority, that would be generated during the liquidation and from the rejection of leases and other executory contracts in connection with a cessation of operations. In addition, if the Chapter 11 Cases are converted to cases under Chapter 7, that would constitute an event of default under the DIP Credit Agreement.\nAs a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, our historical financial information may be volatile and not be indicative of our future financial performance.\nDuring the Chapter 11 Cases, we expect our financial results under U.S. GAAP to continue to be volatile as asset impairments, asset dispositions, restructuring activities and expenses, contract terminations and rejections, and claims assessments may significantly impact our Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result, our historical financial performance may not be indicative of our financial performance after the date of the bankruptcy filing.\nOur capital structure will likely be significantly altered under any Chapter 11 plan confirmed by the Court. Under fresh-start accounting rules that may apply to us upon the effective date of a Chapter 11 plan, our assets and liabilities would be adjusted to fair value, which could have a significant impact on our financial statements. Accordingly, if fresh-start accounting rules apply, our financial condition and results of operations following our emergence from Chapter 11 would not be comparable to the financial condition and results of operations reflected in our historical financial statements. In connection with the Chapter 11 Cases and the development of a Chapter 11 plan, it is also possible that additional restructuring and related charges may be identified and recorded in future periods. Such charges could be material to our consolidated financial position, liquidity and results of operations.\nTransfers of our equity, or issuances of equity in connection with our Chapter 11 Cases, may impair our ability to utilize our federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards in future years.\nUnder federal income tax law, a corporation is generally permitted to deduct from taxable income net operating losses carried forward from prior years. We have NOLs of approximately $2.2 billion as of December 31, 2018. Our ability to utilize our NOLs to offset future taxable income and to reduce federal income tax liability is subject to certain requirements and restrictions. If we experience an \u201cownership change,\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, then our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards may be substantially limited, which could have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations. Generally, there is an \u201cownership change\u201d if one or more shareholders owning five percent or more of a corporation\u2019s common stock (\"Substantial Shareholder\") have aggregate increases in their ownership of such stock of more than 50 percentage points over the prior three-year period.\nWe received relief from the Court to establish notice and sell-down procedures for trading of our common shares in order to provide us with the ability to formulate a plan of reorganization that preserves our tax attributes. Under the order, prior to any proposed acquisition or disposition of equity securities that would result in an increase or decrease in the amount of our equity securities owned by a Substantial Shareholder, or that would result in a person or entity becoming a Substantial Shareholder, such person or entity is required to file with the Court and notify us of such acquisition or disposition. We have the right to seek an injunction from the Court to prevent certain acquisitions or sales of our common shares if the acquisition or sale would pose a material risk of adversely affecting our ability to utilize such tax attributes.\nFollowing the implementation of a plan of reorganization, it is possible that an \u201cownership change\u201d may be deemed to occur. Under Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, absent an application exception, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d the amount of its net operating losses that may be utilized to offset future taxable income generally is subject to an annual limitation. If an ownership change occurs and our NOLs are subject to the Section 382 limitation, this could adversely impact our future cash flows if we have taxable income and are not able to offset it through the utilization of our NOLs. See further discussion of the impact of the restructuring on our tax attributes as part of \"Note 12. Income taxes\" in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe have significant exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices since none of our estimated future production is covered by commodity derivative contracts and we may not be able to enter into commodity derivative contracts covering our estimated future production on favorable terms or at all.\nDuring the Chapter 11 Cases, our ability to enter into commodity derivative contracts covering estimated future production is limited under the DIP Credit Agreement. We are only permitted to enter into commodity derivative contracts with lenders under the DIP Credit Agreement. As a result, we may not be able to enter into commodity derivative contracts covering our production in future periods on favorable terms or at all. None of our estimated future production is currently covered by commodity derivative contracts; therefore, we will continue to be significantly impacted by changes in commodity prices if we cannot or choose not to enter into commodity derivative contracts in the future. Our inability to hedge the risk of low commodity prices in the future, on favorable terms or at all, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have and may continue to experience increased levels of employee attrition as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases.\nAs a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, we have and may continue to experience increased levels of employee attrition, and our employees likely will face considerable distraction and uncertainty. A loss of key personnel or material erosion of employee morale could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our ability to engage, motivate and retain key employees or take other measures intended to motivate and incentivize key employees to remain with us through the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases is limited by restrictions on implementation of incentive programs under the Bankruptcy Code. The loss of services of members of our senior management team could impair our ability to execute our strategy and implement operational initiatives, which would be likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, Liquidity and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nOil and natural gas prices, which are subject to fluctuations, have declined substantially from historical highs. Reductions in oil and natural gas prices have, and may in the future, adversely affect our revenues as well as our ability to maintain or increase our borrowing capacity, repay current or future indebtedness and obtain additional capital on attractive terms.\nOur future financial condition, access to capital, cash flow and results of operations depend upon the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas. We are particularly dependent on prices for natural gas. Historically, oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nweather conditions;\n\u2022\nthe price and quantity of imports and exports of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\npolitical conditions and events in other oil-producing and natural gas-producing countries, including embargoes, hostilities in the Middle East and other sustained military campaigns, and acts of terrorism or sabotage;\n\u2022\nthe actions of the OPEC and other significant oil and natural gas producing nations;\n\u2022\ndomestic and international government regulation, legislation and policies, including levying tariffs on oil and natural gas imports;\n\u2022\nthe level of global oil and natural gas inventories;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels and other energy sources; and\n\u2022\noverall economic conditions.\nOil and natural gas prices are currently depressed compared to recent historical levels; however, they may never return to historical highs or remain at a level that allows us to economically operate our business. Prices of oil and natural gas have historically been extremely volatile and we expect this volatility to continue.\nDuring 2018, the NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas price fluctuated from a high of $6.88 per Mmbtu to a low of $2.48 per Mmbtu, while the NYMEX WTI crude oil price ranged from a high of $76.41 per Bbl to a low of $42.53 per Bbl. For the five years ended December 31, 2018, the NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas price ranged from a high of $7.94 per Mmbtu to a low of $1.49 per Mmbtu, while the NYMEX WTI crude oil price ranged from a high of $107.26 per Bbl to a low of $26.21 per Bbl.\nOn December 31, 2018, the spot market price for natural gas at Henry Hub was $3.07 per Mmbtu, a 3% increase from December 31, 2017. On December 31, 2018, the spot market price for crude oil at Cushing was $45.41 per Bbl, a 25% decrease from December 31, 2017. For 2018, our average realized prices (before the impact of derivative financial instruments) for oil and natural gas were $66.78 per Bbl and $2.85 per Mcf, respectively, compared with 2017 average realized prices of $49.82 per Bbl and $2.51 per Mcf, respectively.\nOur revenues, cash flow and profitability, as well as our ability to maintain or increase our borrowing capacity, to repay current or future indebtedness and to obtain additional capital on attractive terms, depend substantially upon oil and natural gas prices. Any sustained reductions in oil and natural gas prices will directly affect our revenues and can indirectly impact expected production by changing the amount of funds available to us to reinvest in exploration and development activities. Further reductions in oil and natural gas prices could also reduce the quantities of reserves that are commercially recoverable. Depressed oil and natural gas prices and reductions in our reserves could have other adverse consequences, including our ability to obtain the exit financing required to consummate a plan of reorganization. Additionally, further or continued declines in prices could result in additional non-cash charges to earnings due to impairments to our oil and natural gas properties.\nIn light of the depressed commodity price environment, there is risk that, among other things:\n\u2022\nthird parties\u2019 confidence in our commercial or financial ability to explore and produce oil and natural gas could erode, which could impact our ability to execute on our business strategy;\n\u2022\nit may become more difficult to retain, attract or replace key employees;\n\u2022\nemployees could be distracted from performance of their duties or more easily attracted to other career opportunities; and\n\u2022\nour suppliers, vendors and service providers could renegotiate the terms of our arrangements, terminate their relationship with us or require financial assurances from us.\nThe occurrence of certain of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in the differential between NYMEX or other benchmark prices of oil and natural gas and the reference or regional index price used to price our actual oil and natural gas sales could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe reference or regional index prices that we use to price our oil and natural gas sales sometimes reflect a premium or discount to the relevant benchmark prices, such as NYMEX. The difference between the benchmark price and the price we reference in our sales contracts is called a differential. We cannot accurately predict oil and natural gas differentials. Changes in differentials between the benchmark price for oil and natural gas and the reference or regional index price we reference in our sales contracts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We have experienced significant volatility in our price differentials including crude oil production from the Eagle Ford shale and natural gas production from certain areas in Appalachia. Our crude oil production from the Eagle Ford shale is currently sold at a price based on the WTI index plus or minus the differential to indices correlated to the Louisiana Light Sweet index. During 2018, the monthly average of this differential ranged from a high of WTI plus $4.99 per barrel to a low of WTI less $0.99 per barrel. Our natural gas production from the Marcellus shale in Northeast Pennsylvania is sold at a price based on a Platts index that represents value into the Transco Leidy Pipeline. Due to the high levels of production in this region without sufficient pipeline capacity or infrastructure to the Northeast United States markets, the monthly average of this differential during 2018 ranged from a low of NYMEX less $0.31 per Mmbtu to a high of NYMEX less $1.38 per Mmbtu. These differentials vary depending on factors such as supply, demand, pipeline capacity, infrastructure and weather. These differentials continue to be volatile; however, the differentials in the region have the potential to be favorably impacted by the expansion of infrastructure and other sources of demand for natural gas in the Northeast region in future years.\nWe may encounter obstacles to marketing our oil and natural gas, which could adversely impact our revenues.\nMarket conditions or the unavailability of satisfactory oil and natural gas transportation arrangements or infrastructure may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production. The availability of a ready market for our oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors, including the demand for and supply of oil and natural gas and the proximity of reserves to pipelines and terminal facilities.\nOur ability to market our production depends, in substantial part, on the availability and capacity of gathering systems, pipelines, processing facilities and oil and condensate trucking operations owned and operated by third-parties. Our failure to obtain these services on acceptable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business. Transportation space on the gathering systems and pipelines we utilize is occasionally limited or unavailable due to repairs, outages caused by accidents or other events, or improvements to facilities or due to space being utilized by other companies that have priority transportation agreements. We may be required to shut-in wells due to lack of a market or inadequacy or unavailability of crude oil or natural gas pipelines, gathering systems or trucking capacity. A portion of our production may also be interrupted, or shut-in, from time to time for numerous other reasons, including as a result of accidents, excessive pressures, maintenance, weather, field labor issues or other disruptions of service. Curtailments and disruptions may last from a few days to several months, and we have no control over when or if third-party facilities are restored.\nWe have experienced production curtailments in our producing regions resulting from offsetting fracturing stimulation operations. As we have increased our knowledge of our shale properties, we have begun to shut-in production on adjacent wells when conducting completion operations. Due to the high production capabilities of these wells, these volumes can be significant. Our access to transportation options can also be affected by U.S. federal and state regulation of oil and natural gas production and transportation, general economic conditions and changes in supply and demand.\nThese factors and the availability of markets are beyond our control. Any significant curtailment in gathering, processing or pipeline system capacity, significant delay in the construction of necessary facilities or lack of availability of transportation would interfere with our ability to market our oil and natural gas production, and could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and results of operations.\nOur oil production in the South Texas region may be curtailed if we are not able to find an operational or commercial solution for the associated natural gas production.\nIn our South Texas region, the primary purchaser of our natural gas allegedly terminated a long-term natural gas sales contract on May 31, 2017. As a result, our ability to transport or sell the natural gas from this region continues to be limited due to the existing infrastructure and we may experience significant curtailments of production in the future if we cannot find an\noperational or commercial solution. After the alleged termination of the long-term natural gas sales contract, we have either sold natural gas on short-term sales contracts or flared natural gas in order to avoid significant curtailments of our oil production. However, our ability and the costs associated with entering into natural gas sales contracts in the future are highly uncertain.\nIn January 2018, we commenced the flaring of natural gas produced in our South Texas region pursuant to temporary flare permits. We submitted a request to the Texas Railroad Commission for an extension of the permits to continue the aforementioned flaring of natural gas for up to two years (the \u201cFlaring Application\u201d). We went before the Texas Railroad Commission at a hearing regarding the Flaring Application in May 2018 and expect that a final ruling will be issued during 2019. See further discussion in \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d. If the Flaring Application is denied or, in the future, we are unable, for any sustained period, to secure acceptable delivery or transportation arrangements or encounter production related difficulties, we may be required to shut-in or curtail production of both oil and natural gas from the affected wells in the South Texas region. Any such shut-in or curtailment or an inability to obtain acceptable terms for delivery of the oil and natural gas produced from our fields, would materially and adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations. We continue to evaluate alternatives, including construction of a Company-owned gathering system or the negotiation of a new gathering agreement.\nWe may experience a financial loss if any of our significant customers fail to pay us for our oil or natural gas or reduce the volume of oil and natural gas that they purchase from us.\nOur ability to collect payments from the sale of oil and natural gas to our customers depends on the payment ability of our customer base, which includes several significant customers. If any one or more of our significant customers fails to pay us for any reason, we could experience a material loss. We are managing our credit risk as a result of the current commodity price environment through the attainment of financial assurances from certain customers. In addition, if any of our significant customers cease to purchase our oil or natural gas or reduce the volume of the oil or natural gas that they purchase from us, the loss or reduction could have a detrimental effect on our production volumes and may cause a temporary interruption in sales of, or a lower price for, our oil and natural gas. We have filed a lawsuit against a subsidiary of Shell regarding their failure to remit payment under certain natural gas sales agreements in the East Texas and North Louisiana regions, see further discussion in \"Item 3. Legal proceedings\".\nThere are risks associated with our drilling activity that could impact our results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to develop properties in new or emerging formations may be subject to more uncertainties than drilling in areas that are more developed or have a longer history of established production.\nOur drilling involves numerous risks, including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs. We must incur significant expenditures to identify and acquire properties and to drill and complete wells. Additionally, seismic and other technology does not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that oil or natural gas is present or economically producible. The costs of drilling and completing wells are often uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors, including unexpected drilling conditions, pressure or irregularities in formations, equipment failures or accidents, weather conditions and shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment. We have experienced some delays in contracting for drilling rigs and in obtaining fracture stimulation crews and materials. Also, we may experience issues with the availability of water and sand used in our drilling and hydraulic fracturing activities. All of these risks could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe results of our drilling in new or emerging formations, including our properties in shale formations, are more uncertain initially than drilling results in areas that are developed, have established production or where we have a longer history of operation. Because new or emerging formations have limited or no production history, we are less able to use past drilling results in those areas to help predict future drilling results. Our experience with horizontal drilling in these areas to date, as well as the industry\u2019s drilling and production history, while growing, is limited. The ultimate success of these drilling and completion techniques will be better evaluated over time as more wells are drilled and production profiles are better established. We have implemented several initiatives to manage our base production and minimize the decline from our shale properties. If these initiatives are not successful and we are required to incur significant expenditures to manage our base production, this could negatively impact our production and cash flows from operations.\nIf our drilling results are less than anticipated or we are unable to execute our drilling program because of capital constraints, lease expirations, and/or natural gas and oil prices decline, our investment in these areas may not be as attractive as we anticipate and we could incur material impairments of undeveloped properties and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nCertain of our undeveloped leasehold assets are subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on the acreage.\nLeases on oil and natural gas properties typically have a term after which they expire unless, prior to expiration, a well is drilled and production of hydrocarbons in paying quantities is established. If our leases expire and we are unable to renew the leases, we will lose our right to develop the related properties. While we seek to actively manage our leasehold inventory through drilling wells to hold the leasehold acreage that we believe is material to our operations, our drilling plans for these areas are subject to change.\nWe conduct a substantial portion of our operations through joint interest and joint venture arrangements. Material disagreements with our partners could have a material adverse effect on the success of these operations, our financial condition and our results of operations. Furthermore, the actions taken by our partners could prevent or alter our development plans.\nWe conduct a substantial portion of our operations through joint interest and joint venture arrangements with third parties. In many instances, we depend on these third parties for elements of these arrangements, such as payments of substantial development and other costs. The performance of these third party obligations or the ability of third parties to meet their obligations under these arrangements is outside our control. If these parties do not meet or satisfy their obligations under these arrangements, the performance and success of these arrangements, and their value to us, may be adversely affected. If our current or future joint interest or joint venture partners are unable to meet their obligations, we may be forced to undertake the obligations ourselves and/or incur additional expenses in order to have some other party perform such obligations. In such cases we may also be required to enforce our rights, which may cause disputes among our partners and us. If any of these events occur, they may adversely impact us, our financial performance and results of operations.\nSuch arrangements may involve risks not otherwise present when exploring and developing properties directly, including, for example:\n\u2022\nour partners may share certain approval rights over major decisions;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that our partners might become insolvent or bankrupt, leaving us liable for their shares of joint interest or joint venture liabilities;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that we may incur liabilities as a result of an action taken by our partners;\n\u2022\npartners may be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives;\n\u2022\ndisputes between us and our partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses, delay or terminate projects and prevent our officers and directors from focusing their time and effort on our business; and\n\u2022\nthat under certain joint venture arrangements, neither joint venture partner may have the power to control the venture and an impasse could be reached that might have a negative influence on our investment in the joint venture.\nThe failure to resolve disagreements with our partners could adversely affect our ability to transact the business that is the subject of such arrangement, which would in turn negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe owners of working interests may not consent to the development of certain properties that we operate, which may require us to assume their share of the working interest during the development and a period after the well is on production. This may require us to expend additional capital that was not anticipated as part of our development plans and assume additional risks associated with the development and future performance of the properties. The owners of working interests in certain properties that we operate may also hold rights within the respective operating agreements that could prevent us from performing additional development activities on the properties such as recompletions and other workovers without their consent.\nWe may be unable to acquire or develop additional reserves, which would reduce our revenues and access to capital.\nOur success depends upon our ability to find, develop or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are profitable to produce. Factors that may hinder our ability to acquire or develop additional oil and natural gas reserves include competition, access to capital, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and the number and attractiveness of properties for sale. If we are unable to conduct successful development activities or acquire properties containing Proved Reserves, our total Proved Reserves will generally decline as a result of production. Also, our production will generally decline. We may be unable to locate additional reserves, drill economically productive wells or acquire properties containing Proved Reserves.\nAcquisitions, development drilling and exploratory drilling are the main methods of replacing reserves. However, development and exploratory drilling operations may not result in any increases in reserves for various reasons. Our future oil and natural gas production depends on our success in finding or acquiring additional reserves. If we fail to replace reserves through drilling or acquisitions, our level of production and cash flows will be adversely affected.\nWe may not correctly evaluate reserve data or the exploitation potential of properties as we engage in our acquisition, exploration, development and exploitation activities.\nOur future success will depend on the success of our acquisition, exploration, development and exploitation activities. Our decisions to purchase, explore, develop or otherwise exploit properties or prospects will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained from production reports and engineering studies, geophysical and geological analyses and seismic and other information, the results of which are often inconclusive and subject to various interpretations. These decisions could significantly reduce our ability to generate cash needed to service our debt and fund our capital program and other working capital requirements.\nOur estimates of oil and natural gas reserves involve inherent uncertainty, which could materially affect the quantity and value of our reported reserves, our financial condition and the value of our common shares.\nNumerous uncertainties are inherent in estimating quantities of Proved Reserves, including many factors beyond our control. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains estimates of our Proved Reserves and the PV-10 and Standardized Measure of our Proved Reserves. These estimates are based upon reports of our independent petroleum engineers. These reports rely upon various assumptions, including assumptions required by the SEC as to oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. These estimates should not be construed as the current market value of our estimated Proved Reserves.\nThe process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex, requiring significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. As a result, the estimates are inherently imprecise evaluations of reserve quantities and future net revenue and such estimates prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers at different times, may vary substantially.\nOur actual future production, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves may vary substantially from those we have assumed in the estimates. Any significant variance in our assumptions could materially affect the quantity and value of reserves, the amount of PV-10 and Standardized Measure described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and our financial condition. In addition, our reserves, the amount of PV-10 and Standardized Measure may be revised downward or upward, based upon production history, results of future exploitation and development activities, prevailing oil and natural gas prices, decisions and assumptions made by engineers and other factors. A material decline in prices paid for our production can adversely impact the estimated volumes and values of our reserves. Similarly, a decline in market prices for oil or natural gas may adversely affect our PV-10 and Standardized Measure. Any of these negative effects on our reserves or PV-10 and Standardized Measure may negatively affect the value of our common shares.\nImpairments of our asset values could have a substantial negative effect on our results of operations and net worth.\nWe follow the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties. Depending upon oil and natural gas prices in the future, and at the end of each quarterly and annual period when we are required to test the carrying value of our assets using full cost accounting rules, we may be required to record an impairment to the value of our oil and natural gas properties if the present value of the after-tax future cash flows from our oil and natural gas properties falls below the net book value of these properties. We have in the past experienced, and may experience in the future, ceiling test impairments with respect to our oil and natural gas properties. As discussed above, we are also currently in Chapter 11 proceedings and, upon the approval of a Chapter 11 plan, may be required to apply fresh-start accounting principles that may cause us to experience additional impairments. See \u201cItem 1A. Risk Factors - As a result of the Chapter 11 cases, our historical financial information may be volatile and not be indicative of our future financial performance\u201d for additional information.\nOur evaluation of impairment is based upon estimates of Proved Reserves. The value of our Proved Reserves may be lowered in future periods as a result of a decline in prices of oil and natural gas, a downward revision of our oil and natural gas reserves or other factors. As a result, our evaluation of impairment for future periods is subject to uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of Proved Reserves, in projecting the future rates of production and in the timing of development activities. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Because several of these factors are beyond our control, we cannot accurately predict or control\nthe amount of ceiling test impairments in future periods. Future ceiling test impairments could negatively affect our results of operations and net worth.\nWe did not recognize any impairments to our proved oil and natural gas properties for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. We may have additional impairments of our oil and natural gas properties in future periods if the cost of our unamortized proved oil and natural gas properties exceeds the limitation under the full cost method of accounting. The possibility and amount of any future impairment is difficult to predict, and will depend, in part, upon future oil and natural gas prices to be utilized in the ceiling test, estimates of proved reserves and future capital expenditures and operating costs.\nWe also test goodwill for impairment annually or when circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. If the book value of our reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, an impairment charge will occur, which would negatively impact our results of operations and net worth. As a result of our testing of goodwill for impairment, we did not record an impairment charge for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nWe are exposed to operating hazards and uninsured risks that could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow.\nOur operations are subject to the risks inherent in the oil and natural gas industry, including the risks of:\n\u2022\nfires, explosions and blowouts;\n\u2022\npipe failures;\n\u2022\nabnormally pressured formations; and\n\u2022\nenvironmental accidents such as oil spills, natural gas leaks, ruptures or discharges of toxic gases, brine or well fluids into the environment (including groundwater contamination).\nWe have in the past experienced some of these events during our drilling, production and midstream operations. These events may result in substantial losses to us from:\n\u2022\ninjury or loss of life;\n\u2022\nsevere damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment;\n\u2022\npollution or other environmental damage;\n\u2022\nenvironmental clean-up responsibilities;\n\u2022\nregulatory investigation;\n\u2022\npenalties and suspension of operations; or\n\u2022\nattorneys\u2019 fees and other expenses incurred in the prosecution or defense of litigation.\nAs is customary in our industry, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks. Our insurance may not be adequate to cover these potential losses or liabilities. Furthermore, insurance coverage may not continue to be available at commercially acceptable premium levels or at all. Due to cost considerations, from time to time we have declined to obtain coverage for certain drilling activities. We do not carry business interruption insurance. Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured or under-insured events could require us to make large unbudgeted cash expenditures that could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow.\nWe are subject to complex federal, state, local and other laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our operations.\nOur oil and natural gas development and production operations are subject to complex and stringent laws and regulations. In order to conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations, we must obtain and maintain numerous permits, approvals and certificates from various federal, state and local governmental authorities. We may incur substantial costs in order to comply with these existing laws and regulations. In addition, our costs of compliance may increase if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted, or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations. Our business is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations as interpreted and enforced by governmental authorities possessing jurisdiction over various aspects of the exploration for, production and sale of, oil and natural gas. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations, as interpreted and enforced, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For additional information, see \u201cItem 1. Business - Applicable Laws and Regulations\".\nOur business exposes us to liability and extensive regulation on environmental matters, which could result in substantial expenditures and could negatively impact production.\nOur operations are subject to numerous complex U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the discharge of materials into the water and air, the generation, management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the clean-up of contaminated sites. Laws, rules and regulations protecting the environment have changed frequently and the changes often include increasingly stringent requirements.\nIn general, the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry has been the subject of increasing scrutiny and regulation by environmental authorities. For example, the EPA has identified ensuring environmental compliance by the energy extraction sector as one of its enforcement initiatives for fiscal years 2017 - 2019. However, the EPA has proposed to transition away from a sector specific initiative for the 2020-2023 fiscal years to a more general focus on significant sources of VOCs.\nCompliance with environmental laws and regulations often increases our cost of doing business and, in turn, decreases our profitability. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the incurrence of investigatory or remedial obligations as well as associated natural resource damages, or the issuance of injunctive relief. Any changes that result in more stringent or costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to maintain compliance, and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our earnings, results of operations, competitive position or financial condition. Changes to the requirements for drilling, completing, operating, and abandoning wells and related facilities could have similar adverse effects on us.\nIn addition, we could incur substantial expenditures complying with environmental laws and regulations, including future environmental laws and regulations which may be more stringent than those currently in effect. For example, the regulation of GHG emissions by the EPA or by various states in the areas in which we conduct business could have an adverse effect on our operations and demand for our oil and natural gas production. Moreover, the EPA has shown a general increased scrutiny on the oil and gas industry through its regulations under the CAA, SDWA, RCRA, TSCA and CWA.\nThe environmental laws and regulations to which we are subject may, among other things:\n\u2022\nrequire us to apply for and receive a permit before drilling commences or certain associated facilities are developed;\n\u2022\nrestrict the types, quantities and concentrations of substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling, hydraulic fracturing, and production activities;\n\u2022\nlimit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other \u201cwaters of the United States,\u201d threatened and endangered species habitats and other protected areas;\n\u2022\nrequire remedial measures to mitigate pollution from current or former operations, such as cleaning up spills, dismantling abandoned facilities, pit closure or plugging abandoned wells;\n\u2022\nrequire additional control and monitoring devices on equipment; and\n\u2022\nimpose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations.\nOur operations may be impacted by recent or changing regulatory standards. For example, the EPA issued effluent limitation guidelines limiting our ability to dispose of waste water from hydraulic fracturing activities into publicly owned wastewater treatment systems. The EPA and state regulators are also reviewing the practices for the disposal of solid waste in surface impoundments from exploration and production facilities under Subtitle D of RCRA and may continue to refine those requirements. The EPA and state regulators are also expanding National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permitting for storm water discharges at drilling sites.\nChanges in regulation can also occur at a state or local level. For example, the State of Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection is updating oil and gas regulations which include more stringent permitting requirements, waste handling disposal and water restoration requirements. Some localities, for example in Texas, are enacting water usage restrictions that may impact oil and gas exploration. In addition, some states have considered, and notably California has adopted, a state specific GHG regulatory program that may limit GHG emissions or may require costs in association with the control of GHG emissions.\nThe implementation of climate change regulations could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for our oil and natural gas production.\nGHG regulations could require us to incur increased operating costs and could have an adverse effect on demand for our oil and natural gas production. In the most recent Congressional session, a resolution was proposed which aimed to dramatically reduce GHG emissions, including a transition from fossil fuel. It is unclear what the future of this or other legislation would be. However, such legislation if adopted could have an adverse effect on demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce.\nIn the absence of comprehensive federal legislation on GHG emission control, the EPA attempted to require the permitting of GHG emissions. Although the U.S. Supreme Court struck down GHG permitting requirements for GHG as a stand-alone pollutant, it upheld the EPA\u2019s authority to control GHG emissions when a source has to secure a major source permit to control the emissions of other criteria pollutants. These permitting provisions, to the extent applicable to our operations, could require us to implement emission controls or other measures to reduce GHG emissions and we could incur additional costs to satisfy those requirements. Additionally, the EPA established GHG reporting requirements for a broad range of sources, including in the petroleum and natural gas industry, requiring those sources to monitor, maintain records on, and annually report their GHG emissions. Although this rule does not limit the amount of GHGs that can be emitted, it requires us to incur costs to monitor record and report GHG emissions associated with our operations.\nAs part of a move to reduce GHG emissions, the EPA has issued new rules limiting methane emissions from new or modified oil and gas sources. The rules amend the air emissions rules for the oil and natural gas sources and natural gas processing and transmission sources to include new standards for methane. Simultaneously with the methane rules, the EPA adopted new rules governing the aggregating of multiple surface sites into a single-source of air quality permitting purposes. The grouping together of sources may cause a group of sources to be treated as a \u201cmajor source\u201d and face enhanced regulation under federal environmental laws, including the CAA.\nFederal, state and local legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays.\nHydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to stimulate natural gas production. Most hydraulic fracturing (other than hydraulic fracturing using diesel) is exempted from regulation under the SDWA. Congress has considered legislation to amend the federal SDWA to remove the exemption from regulation and permitting that is applicable to hydraulic fracturing operations and require reporting and disclosure of chemicals used by the oil and natural gas industry in the hydraulic fracturing process. Many states have adopted or are considering legislation regulating hydraulic fracturing, including the disclosure of chemicals used in the process. Such bills or similar legislation, if adopted, could increase the possibility of litigation and establish an additional level of regulation that could lead to operational delays or increased operating costs and could result in additional regulatory burdens, making it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and increasing our costs of compliance. At the state and local levels, some jurisdictions have adopted, and others are considering adopting, requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities, as well as bans on hydraulic fracturing activities. In the event that new or more stringent state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we have properties, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.\nIn addition, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing using diesel under the SDWA\u2019s Underground Injection Control Program (\u201cUIC\u201d) and has issued guidance regarding its authority over the permitting of these activities. Additionally, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that \u201cwater cycle\u201d activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources \u201cunder some circumstances,\u201d including water withdrawals for fracturing in times or areas of low water availability; surface spills during the management of fracturing fluids, chemicals or produced water; injection of fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity; injection of fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources; discharge of inadequately treated fracturing wastewater to surface waters; and disposal or storage of fracturing wastewater in unlined pits. If this assessment results in additional regulatory scrutiny, it could make it difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business. Consequently, these studies and initiatives could spur further legislative or regulatory action regarding hydraulic fracturing or similar production operations.\nFurther, in June 2016, the EPA published an effluent limit guideline final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants.\nThese new initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing may increase our cost of disposal and impact our business operations and could cause our hydraulic fracturing activities to become subject to additional permit requirements or operations restrictions which could lead to permitting delays and potential increases in costs. Restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we ultimately are able to produce.\nThe EPA has adopted rules to limit air emissions from oil and gas operations, subjecting oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission and storage operations to regulation under the NSPS and NESHAPS programs under the CAA. The EPA rules include NSPS standards for completions of hydraulically fractured natural gas wells. Before January 1, 2015, these standards require owners/operators to reduce VOC emissions from natural gas not sent to the gathering line during well completion either by flaring, using a completion combustion device, or by capturing the natural gas using green completions with a completion combustion device. Beginning January 1, 2015, operators must capture the natural gas and make it available for use or sale, which can be done through the use of green completions. The standards are applicable to newly fractured wells and also existing wells that are refractured. Further, the finalized regulations also establish specific new requirements, effective in 2012, for emissions from compressors, controllers, dehydrators, storage tanks, natural gas processing plants and certain other equipment. The implementation of these new requirements may result in increased operating and compliance costs, increased regulatory burdens and delays in our operations. There may also be further refinement to existing NSPS standards for VOCs as data is gathered about the implementation of those requirements.\nWe operate in a litigious environment.\nAny constituent could bring suit regarding our existing or planned operations or allege a violation of an existing contract. Any such action could delay when planned operations can actually commence or could cause a halt to existing production until such alleged violations are resolved by the courts. Not only could we incur significant legal and support expenses in defending our rights, but halting existing production or delaying planned operations could impact our future operations and financial condition. In addition, we are defendants in numerous cases involving claims by landowners for surface or subsurface damages arising from our operations and for claims by unleased mineral owners and royalty owners for unpaid or underpaid revenues customary in our business. We incur costs in defending these claims and from time to time must pay damages or other amounts due. Such legal disputes can also distract management and other personnel from their primary responsibilities. For additional information on our significant litigation matters, see \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings\" and \"Note 8. Commitments and contingencies\u201d in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by security threats, including cybersecurity threats, and other disruptions.\nAs an oil and natural gas production company, we face various security threats, including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable; threats to the safety of our employees; threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure or third party facilities and infrastructure, such as processing plants and pipelines; and threats from terrorist acts. Although we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor these threats and mitigate our exposure to such threats, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient in preventing security threats from materializing. If any of these events were to materialize, they could lead to losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure, personnel or capabilities essential to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The implementation of additional procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate security threats and to increase security for our information, facilities and infrastructure may result in increased capital and operating costs. Cybersecurity attacks in particular are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. These events could damage our reputation and lead to financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability.\nThere are inherent limitations in all internal controls over financial reporting, and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nWhile we have taken actions designed to address compliance with the internal control, disclosure control and other requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC implementing these requirements, there are inherent limitations in our ability to control all circumstances. Our management, including our chief financial officer and chief accounting officer, do not expect that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs. Because of the inherent\nlimitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, in our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Further, controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more persons, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, a control may be inadequate because of changes in conditions, such as growth of our company or increased transaction volume, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements included herein contain disclosures that express substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, indicating the possibility that we may not be able to operate in the future.\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements included herein have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and other commitments in the normal course of business. The Consolidated Financial Statements do not reflect any adjustments that might result from the outcome of our Chapter 11 proceedings. Our level of indebtedness has adversely impacted and is continuing to adversely impact our financial condition. The outcome of our Chapter 11 process is subject to a high degree of uncertainty and is dependent upon factors outside of our control, including actions of the Court and our creditors. The significant risks and uncertainties related to our liquidity and Chapter 11 proceedings described above raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nSee further discussion regarding our ability to continue as a going concern as part of \"Note 1. Organization and basis of presentation\" in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Shares\nOur common shares are no longer listed on a national securities exchange and were deregistered under the Exchange Act, which may have a negative impact on our share price, volatility and Liquidity.\nSince December 27, 2017, our common shares have been trading over the counter on the OTC Pink Marketplace under the ticker symbol \u201cXCOO.\u201d Our common shares continue to trade under that symbol with the added designation of \u201cQ\u201d to symbolize that we are currently in bankruptcy proceedings.\nOur bankruptcy proceedings, as well as the delisting of our common shares from the NYSE and commencement of trading on the OTC Pink Marketplace, has resulted and may continue to result in a significant reduction in some or all of the following, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our shareholders:\n\u2022\nthe liquidity of our common shares;\n\u2022\nthe market price of shares of our common shares;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations;\n\u2022\nthe number of institutional and other investors that will consider investing in shares of our common shares;\n\u2022\nthe number of market makers in our common shares;\n\u2022\nthe availability of information concerning the trading prices and volume of our common shares; and\n\u2022\nthe number of broker-dealers willing to execute trades in our common shares.\nThere is no assurance that we will continue to trade on the OTC Pink Marketplace as we are dependent on one or more market makers establishing a market for our common shares, and even if they continue to do so, there can be no assurance that an active trading market will be maintained. Broker-dealers may decline to trade in the OTC Pink Marketplace because (1) the market for such securities is often limited, (2) such securities are generally more volatile, and (3) the risk to investors is generally greater. Selling our shares could be difficult because smaller quantities of shares can be bought and sold, transactions can be delayed and securities analyst and media coverage of us may be reduced. These factors could result in lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for shares of our common shares as well as lower trading volume. We cannot provide any assurance that, even if our common shares continue to be listed or quoted on the OTC Pink Marketplace or another market or system, the market for our common shares will be liquid.\nOn February 15, 2019, we deregistered our common shares under the Exchange Act, which terminated the requirement to publicly file reports including financial statements and other pertinent information about the Company. As a result, our common share price and liquidity of our common shares may be further negatively impacted since there will be significantly less public information about the Company.\nWe believe it is highly likely that our existing common shares will be canceled at the conclusion of our Chapter 11 proceedings, and the holders of our existing common shares are not expected to be entitled to any recovery. As a result, we expect that the market for our common shares will be extremely limited during the pendency of our bankruptcy proceedings. See Item \"1A. Risk Factors - We believe it is highly likely that our existing common shares will be canceled at the conclusion of our Chapter 11 proceedings\".\nOur common share price may fluctuate or remain significantly depressed throughout the pendency of our bankruptcy proceedings.\nOur common shares currently trade on OTC Pink Marketplace but may have severely limited liquidity as a result of our bankruptcy proceedings, among other things. The market price of our common shares has previously experienced significant fluctuations as a result of:\n\u2022\nbankruptcy proceedings and the outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases;\n\u2022\ndilutive issuances of our common shares;\n\u2022\nannouncements relating to our business or the business of our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in expectations as to our future financial performance or changes in financial estimates of public market analysis;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated quarterly variations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nconditions generally affecting the oil and natural gas industry;\n\u2022\nthe success of our operating strategy; and\n\u2022\nthe operating and share price performance of other comparable companies.\nMany of these factors are beyond our control and we cannot predict their potential effects on the price of our common shares. The price of our common shares may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of these or other factors. However, we currently believe it is highly likely that our existing common shares will be canceled at the conclusion of our Chapter 11 proceedings, and the holders of our existing common shares are not expected to be entitled to any recovery. As a result, the market price of our common shares may remain significantly depressed during the pendency of our Chapter 11 proceedings. See \"Item 1A. Risk Factors - We believe it is highly likely that our existing common shares will be canceled at the conclusion of our Chapter 11 proceedings\".", "PERMNO": 91109, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "EXCE"}
