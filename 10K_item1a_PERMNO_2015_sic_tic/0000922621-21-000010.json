{"cik": "922621", "company": "ERIE INDEMNITY CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-25", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business involves various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to those discussed in this section. The risks and uncertainties described in the risk factors below, or any additional risk outside of those discussed below, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, or liquidity if they were to develop into actual events. This information should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and in other reports and materials we file periodically with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nOur risks have been divided into the following categories:\nRisks related to Erie Insurance Exchange - risks related to our dependence on our relationship with the Exchange associated with management fees, premium growth, and financial condition, as the Exchange is our sole customer and principal source of revenue\nOperating risks - risks stemming from events or circumstances that directly or indirectly affect our operations, including our operations as attorney-in-fact for the Exchange\nMarket, Capital, and Liquidity risks - risks that may impact the values or results or our investment portfolio, ability to meet financial obligations or covenants, or obtain capital as necessary\nAlthough we have organized risks generally according to these categories in the discussion below, risks may have impacts in more than one category and are included where the impact is most significant.\nRisks related to Erie Insurance Exchange\nIf the management fee rate paid by the Exchange is reduced or if there is a significant decrease in the amount of direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange, revenues and profitability could be materially adversely affected.\nWe are dependent upon management fees paid by the Exchange, which represent our principal source of revenue. Pursuant to the subscriber's agreement with the subscribers at the Exchange, we may retain up to 25% of all direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange. Therefore, management fee revenue from the Exchange is calculated by multiplying the management fee rate by the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange. Accordingly, any reduction in direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange and/or the management fee rate would have a negative effect on our revenues and net income.\nThe management fee rate is determined by our Board of Directors and may not exceed 25% of the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange. The Board of Directors sets the management fee rate each December for the following year. At their discretion, the rate can be changed at any time. The process of setting the management fee rate includes the evaluation of current year operating results compared to both prior year and industry estimated results for both Indemnity and the Exchange, and consideration of several factors for both entities including: their relative financial strength and capital position; projected revenue, expense and earnings for the subsequent year; future capital needs; as well as competitive position. The evaluation of these factors could result in a reduction to the management fee rate and our revenues and profitability could be materially adversely affected.\nServing as the attorney-in-fact in the reciprocal insurance exchange structure results in the Exchange being our sole customer. We have an interest in the growth of the Exchange as our earnings are largely generated from management fees based on the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange. If the Exchange's ability to grow or renew policies were adversely impacted, the premium revenue of the Exchange would be adversely affected which would reduce our management fee revenue. The circumstances or events that might impair the Exchange's ability to grow include, but are not limited to, the items discussed below.\nUnfavorable changes in macroeconomic conditions, including declining consumer confidence, inflation, high unemployment, and the threat of recession, among others, may lead the Exchange's customers to modify coverage, not renew policies, or even cancel policies, which could adversely affect the premium revenue of the Exchange, and consequently our management fee.\nThe Exchange faces significant competition from other regional and national insurance companies. The property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive on the basis of product, price and service. If the Exchange's competitors offer property and casualty products with more coverage or offer lower rates, and the Exchange is unable to implement product improvements quickly enough to keep pace, its ability to grow and renew its business may be adversely impacted. In addition, due to the Exchange's premium concentration in the automobile and homeowners insurance markets, it may be more sensitive to trends that could affect auto and home insurance coverages and rates over time, for example changing vehicle usage, usage-based methods of determining premiums, ownership and driving patterns such as ride sharing, advancements in vehicle or home technology or safety features such as accident and loss prevention technologies, the development of autonomous vehicles, or residential occupancy patterns, among other factors. Innovations by competitors or other market participants may increase the level of competition in the industry. If we fail to respond to those innovations on a timely basis, our competitive position and results may be materially adversely affected.\nThe Exchange markets and sells its insurance products through independent, non-exclusive insurance agencies. These agencies are not obligated to sell only the Exchange's insurance products, and generally also sell products of the Exchange's competitors. If agencies do not maintain their current levels of marketing efforts, bind the Exchange to unacceptable risks, place business with competing insurers, or the Exchange is unsuccessful in attracting or retaining agencies in its distribution system as well as maintaining its relationships with those agencies, the Exchange's ability to grow and renew its business may be adversely impacted. Additionally, consumer preferences may cause the insurance industry as a whole to migrate to a delivery system other than independent agencies.\nThe Exchange maintains a brand recognized for customer service. The perceived performance, actions, conduct and behaviors of employees, independent insurance agency representatives, and third-party service partners may result in reputational harm to the Exchange's brand. Specific incidents which may cause harm include but are not limited to disputes, long customer wait times, errors in processing a claim, failure to protect sensitive customer data, and negative or inaccurate social media or traditional media communications. Likewise, an inability to match or exceed the service provided by competitors, which is increasingly relying on digital delivery and enhanced distribution technology, may impede the Exchange's ability to maintain and/or grow its customer base. If third-party service providers fail to perform as anticipated, the Exchange may experience operational difficulties, increased costs and reputational damage. If an extreme catastrophic event were to occur in a heavily concentrated geographic area of subscribers/policyholders, an extraordinarily high number of claims could have the potential to strain claims processing and affect the Exchange's ability to satisfy its customers. Any reputational harm to the Exchange could have the potential to impair its ability to grow and renew its business.\nWe have an interest in the financial condition of the Exchange based on serving as the attorney-in-fact in the reciprocal insurance exchange structure and the Exchange being our sole customer. If the Exchange were to fail to maintain acceptable financial strength ratings, its competitive position in the insurance industry would be adversely affected. If a rating downgrade led to customers not renewing or canceling policies, or impacted the Exchange's ability to attract new customers, the premium revenue of the Exchange would be adversely affected which would reduce our management fee revenue. The circumstances or events that might impair the Exchange's financial condition include, but are not limited to, the items discussed below.\nFinancial strength ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies such as the Exchange. Higher ratings generally indicate greater financial stability and a stronger ability to meet ongoing obligations to policyholders. The Exchange's A.M. Best rating is currently A+ (\"Superior\"). Rating agencies periodically review insurers' ratings and change their rating criteria; therefore, the Exchange's current rating may not be maintained in the future. A significant downgrade in this or other ratings could reduce the competitive position of the Exchange, making it more difficult to attract profitable business in the highly competitive property and casualty insurance market and potentially result in reduced sales of its products and lower premium revenue.\nThe performance of the Exchange's investment portfolio is subject to a variety of investment risks. The Exchange's investment portfolio is comprised principally of fixed income securities, equity securities and limited partnerships. The fixed income portfolio is subject to a number of risks including, but not limited to, interest rate risk, investment credit risk, sector/concentration risk and liquidity risk. The Exchange's common stock and preferred equity securities have exposure to price risk, the risk of potential loss in estimated fair value resulting from an adverse change in prices. Limited partnerships are significantly less liquid and generally involve higher degrees of price risk than publicly traded securities. Limited partnerships, like publicly traded securities, have exposure to market volatility; but unlike fixed income securities, cash flows and return expectations are less predictable. If any investments in the Exchange's investment portfolio were to suffer a substantial decrease in value, the Exchange's financial position could be materially adversely affected through increased unrealized losses or impairments. A significant decrease in the Exchange's portfolio could also put it, or its subsidiaries, at risk of failing to satisfy regulatory or rating agency minimum capital requirements.\nProperty and casualty insurers are subject to extensive regulatory supervision in the states in which they do business. This regulatory oversight includes, by way of example, matters relating to licensing, examination, rate setting, market conduct, policy forms, limitations on the nature and amount of certain investments, claims practices, mandated participation in involuntary markets and guaranty funds, reserve adequacy, insurer solvency, restrictions on underwriting standards, accounting standards, and transactions between affiliates. Such regulation and supervision are primarily for the benefit and protection of policyholders. Changes in applicable insurance laws, tax statutes, regulations, or changes in the way regulators administer those laws, tax statutes, or regulations could adversely impact the Exchange's business, cash flows, results of operations, financial condition, or operating environment and increase its exposure to loss or put it at a competitive disadvantage, which could result in reduced sales of its products and lower premium revenue.\nProperty and casualty insurers face a significant risk of litigation and regulatory investigations and actions in the ordinary course of operating their businesses including the risk of class action lawsuits and claims regarding the infringement of the intellectual property of others. Plaintiffs in class action and other lawsuits against the Exchange may seek large or indeterminate amounts of damages, including punitive and treble damages, which may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. The Exchange is also subject to various regulatory inquiries, such as information requests, subpoenas, and books and record examinations from state and federal regulators and authorities.\nAs insurance industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. In some instances, these emerging issues may not become apparent for some time after the Exchange has issued the affected insurance policies. As a result, the full extent of liability under the Exchange's insurance policies may not be known for many years after the policies are issued. These issues may adversely affect the Exchange's business by either extending coverage beyond its underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims.\nThe Exchange's insurance operations are exposed to claims arising out of catastrophes. Common natural catastrophic events include hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, hail storms, and severe winter weather. The frequency and severity of these catastrophes is inherently unpredictable. Changing climate conditions have added to the unpredictability, frequency and severity of natural disasters and have created additional uncertainty as to future trends and exposures. A single catastrophic occurrence or aggregation of multiple smaller occurrences within its geographical region of the Exchange or its assumed property reinsurance portfolio could adversely affect the financial condition of the Exchange. Man-made disasters such as terrorist attacks and riots could also cause losses from insurance claims related to the property and casualty insurance operations, which could adversely affect its financial condition.\nIf the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic impair the Exchange\u2019s ability to grow or its financial condition, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a global pandemic. The significant economic disruption and uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic that began in 2020 continues to evolve and the pandemic\u2019s ultimate impact and duration remain highly uncertain at this time. If future waves of the virus occur or effective\nmedical treatments are not administered, future restrictions, including business closures and stay at home orders, and a prolonged recession remain a possibility. The resulting effects, including a decline in consumer activity, lower demand for certain services, high unemployment, payroll declines, and reduced personal income may cause customers to modify coverages, not renew or cancel policies, which may have a negative impact on the Exchange\u2019s written premiums, and therefore our management fees. Accordingly, the extent and duration of the effects on future customer demand and buying practices remains uncertain. A specific action taken by the Exchange both in response to changes in exposure as less driving occurs and to provide financial relief to the policyholders has resulted in a certain reduction to the Exchange\u2019s written premiums. In 2020, the Exchange and its subsidiaries announced an estimated $200 million in personal and commercial auto rate reductions effective beginning July 1, 2020 at the time of new policy issuance or policy renewal. Estimated remaining rate reductions related to this event of $110 million in premiums and a corresponding decrease of $28 million in management fee revenue will impact both the Exchanges\u2019 written premium and our management fee revenue in 2021. Longer term, there could be sustained changes in driving patterns if working remotely becomes more common and accepted, potentially having a negative impact on premium revenues. Further declines in economic conditions, potential regulatory actions, or competitive pressure could also impact the Exchange\u2019s rates and written premium, and therefore our management fees.\nThe Exchange is represented by independent agencies that serve as its sole distribution channel. The economic impact of the pandemic on independent agents\u2019 business operations or systems capabilities could make it difficult for independent agents to write new business and retain existing business and/or constrain the ability to recruit new agents, thereby impeding premium growth. While independent agents have been able to work remotely or safely in their offices, future waves of the virus could adversely impact their operations and their ability to write new business and provide service to existing policyholders. More broadly, independent agents may face challenges sustaining their own business operations and financial conditions that could result in the sale or closure of their businesses, thereby reducing the agency force of the Exchange. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic could be an accelerant to shifting consumer behaviors toward increased digital interactions.\nThe unknown risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic may cause additional uncertainty in the process of estimating loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. For example, the behavior of claimants and policyholders may change in unexpected ways, the disruption to the court system may impact the timing and amounts of claims settlements, and the actions taken by governmental bodies, both legislative and regulatory, in reaction to COVID-19 and their related impacts are hard to predict. As a result, the Exchange's estimated level of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves may change.\nThe Exchange\u2019s financial condition could be impacted by defaults or delays in collecting premiums from customers due to economic hardships. Regulatory actions including temporary suspension of policy cancellations for the nonpayment of premiums and relaxing due dates for premium payments could also have a negative impact to the Exchange. If there were legislative action to retroactively mandate coverage irrespective of terms, exclusions or other conditions included in business interruption policies that would otherwise preclude coverage, this could have a material impact on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Exchange.\nThe Exchange and its subsidiaries have been named as defendants in a number of pandemic-related lawsuits and, therefore, are subject to the risks and uncertainties of such litigation. There is also a risk that the Exchange could suffer reputational harm if any actions taken are not viewed as sufficient responses to the pandemic by customers or consumer organizations.\nWhile the Exchange\u2019s investment portfolio was negatively impacted by the significant disruption to financial markets in the first quarter of 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, market conditions substantially recovered through the remainder of the year. The value of the Exchange\u2019s invested assets could be adversely impacted and there is potential for further impairments on its investment portfolio as long as market conditions remain volatile in response to the developments of this pandemic and the related economic impacts.\nThe duration and extent of the impact on the Exchange\u2019s business, strategy, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows cannot be estimated with a high degree of certainty at this time given the ongoing developments of this pandemic and the related impacts on the economy and financial markets.\nOperating risks\nIf the costs of providing services to the Exchange are not controlled, our profitability could be materially adversely affected.\nPursuant to the subscriber's agreement, we perform policy issuance and renewal services for the subscribers at the Exchange and we serve as the attorney-in-fact on behalf of the Exchange with respect to its administrative services. The most significant costs we incur in providing policy issuance and renewal services are commissions, employee costs, and technology costs.\nCommissions to independent agents are our largest expense. Commissions include scheduled commissions to agents based upon premiums written as well as additional commissions and bonuses to agents, which are earned by achieving certain targeted measures. Changes to commission rates or bonus programs may result in increased future costs and lower profitability. Our second largest expense is employee costs, including salaries, healthcare, pension, and other benefit costs. Regulatory developments, provider relationships, and demographic and economic factors that are beyond our control indicate that employee healthcare costs could continue to increase which could reduce our profitability. The defined benefit pension plan we offer to our employees is affected by variable factors such as the interest rate used to discount pension liabilities, asset performance and changes in retirement patterns, which are beyond our control and any related future costs increases would reduce our profitability.\nTechnological development is necessary to facilitate ease of doing business for employees, agents and customers. Insurance company technological developments are focused on simplifying and improving the customer experience, increasing efficiencies, redesigning products and addressing other potentially disruptive changes in the insurance industry. As we continue to develop technology initiatives in order to remain competitive, our profitability could be negatively impacted as we invest in system development.\nIf we are unable to attract, develop, and retain talented executives, key managers, and employees our financial conditions and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur success is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain talented executives and other key management. Talent is defined as people with the right skills, knowledge, abilities, character, and motivation. The loss of the services and leadership of certain key officers and the failure to attract and develop talented new executives and managers could prevent us from successfully communicating, implementing, and executing business strategies.\nOur success also depends on our ability to attract, develop, and retain a talented employee base. The inability to staff all functions of our business with employees possessing the appropriate talent, failure to recognize and respond to changing trends and other circumstances that affect our employees, or failure to instill appropriate cultural expectations and behavioral norms within our employees could have an adverse effect on our business performance. Staffing appropriately talented employees for the handling of claims and servicing of customers, rendering of disciplined underwriting, and effective sales and marketing are critical to the core functions of our business. In addition, talented employees in the actuarial, finance, human resources, law, and information technology areas are also essential to support our core functions.\nIf we are unable to ensure system availability or effectively manage technology initiatives, we may experience adverse financial consequences and/or may be unable to compete effectively.\nOur business is highly dependent upon the effectiveness of our technology and information systems which support key functions of our core business operations including processing applications and premium payments, providing customer support, performing actuarial and financial analysis, and maintaining key data. Additionally, the Exchange relies heavily on technology systems for processing claims. In order to support our business processes and strategic initiatives in a cost and resource efficient manner, we must maintain the effectiveness of existing technology systems and continue to both develop new, and enhance existing, technology systems. As we invest in the development of our systems, costs and completion times could exceed original estimates, and/or the project may not deliver the anticipated benefit or perform as expected. If we do not effectively and efficiently manage and upgrade our technology systems, our ability to serve our customers and implement our strategic initiatives could be adversely impacted.\nAdditionally, we depend on a large amount of data to price policies appropriately, track exposures, perform financial analysis, report to regulatory bodies, and ultimately make business decisions. Should this data be inaccurate or insufficient, risk exposure may be underestimated and/or poor business decisions may be made. This may in turn lead to adverse operational or financial performance and adverse customer or investor confidence.\nIf we experience difficulties with technology, data and network security, including as a result of cyber attacks, third-party relationships or cloud-based relationships, our ability to conduct our business could be adversely impacted.\nIn the normal course of business, we collect, use, store and where appropriate, disclose data concerning individuals and businesses. We also conduct business using third-party vendors who may provide software, data storage, cloud-based computing and other technology services. We have on occasion experienced, and will continue to experience, cyber threats to our data and systems. Cyber threats can create significant risks such as destruction of systems or data, denial or interruption of service, disruption of transaction execution, loss or exposure of customer data, theft or exposure of our intellectual property,\ntheft of funds or disruption of other important business functions. The business we conduct with our third-party vendors may expose us to increased risk related to data security, service disruptions or effectiveness of our control system.\nIn addition, we are subject to numerous federal and state data privacy laws relating to the privacy of the nonpublic personal information of our customers, employees and others. The improper access, disclosure, or misuse or mishandling of information sent to or received from a customer, employee or third party could result in legal liability, regulatory action and reputational damage. Third parties on whom we rely for certain business processing functions are also subject to these risks, and their failure to adhere to these laws and regulations could negatively impact us.\nWe employ a company-wide cybersecurity program of technical, administrative, physical and disclosure controls intended to reduce the risk of cyber threats and protect our information, as well as to communicate potential material threats and incidents. Our cybersecurity philosophy and approach align to the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework and its core elements to identify, protect, detect, respond and recover from the various forms of cyber threats. Our practices include, but are not limited to, cybersecurity protocols and controls, system monitoring and detection, communication of incidents to appropriate management, vendor risk management, and ongoing privacy and cybersecurity training for employees and contractors concerning cyber risk. We periodically assess the effectiveness of our cybersecurity efforts including independent validation and verification and security assessments conducted by independent third parties. The number, complexity and sophistication of cyber threats continue to increase over time. The controls we have implemented, and continue to develop, may not be sufficient to prevent events like unauthorized physical or electronic access, denial of service, cyber attacks, or other security breaches to our computer systems or those of third parties with whom we do business. In some cases, such events may not be immediately detected and/or the impact of such events immediately determined.\nOur Board of Directors oversees our activities with respect to managing cyber risk through its Risk Committee. Management periodically reports on our cybersecurity risk management program including our risk evaluation and the results of independent third-party security assessments, and our efforts to mitigate cyber related risks.\nTo date, we are not aware of any material cybersecurity breach with respect to our systems or data. Any cyber incident or other security breach could cause disruption in our business operations and may result in other negative consequences including significant remediation costs, loss of revenue, additional regulatory scrutiny, fines, litigation, monetary damages and reputational harm. While we maintain cyber liability insurance to mitigate the financial risk around cyber incidents, such insurance may not cover all costs associated with the consequences of information or systems being compromised. As a result, in the event of a material cybersecurity breach, our business, cash flows, financial condition or results of operations could be materially, adversely affected.\nIf events occurred causing interruption of our operations, facilities, systems or business functions, it could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results.\nWe have an established business continuity plan to ensure the continuation of core business operations in the event that normal business operations could not be performed due to a catastrophic or other event. While we continue to test and assess our business continuity plan to validate it meets the needs of our core business operations and addresses multiple business interruption events, there is no assurance that core business operations could be performed upon the occurrence of such an event. Employee absence, physical premises damage, systems failures or outages could compromise our ability to perform our business functions in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to conduct business and hurt our relationships with our business partners and customers. Our business continuity is also dependent on third-party personnel, infrastructure and systems on which we rely. Our operations and those of our third-party vendors may become vulnerable to damage or disruption due to circumstances beyond our or their control, such as from catastrophic events, power anomalies or outages, natural disasters, network failures, and cyber attacks. Disruption of our operations for any reason could result in a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe are subject to applicable insurance laws, tax statutes, and regulations, as well as claims and legal proceedings, which, if determined unfavorably, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe face a significant risk of litigation and regulatory investigations and actions in the ordinary course of operating our businesses including the risk of class action lawsuits. We are, have been, or may become subject to class actions and individual suits alleging breach of fiduciary or other duties, including our obligations to indemnify directors and officers in connection with certain legal matters. We are also subject to litigation arising out of our general business activities such as contractual and employment relationships and claims regarding the infringement of the intellectual property of others. Plaintiffs in class action and other lawsuits against us may seek large or indeterminate amounts of damages, including punitive and treble damages, which may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. We are also subject to various regulatory inquiries, such as\ninformation requests, subpoenas, and books and record examinations from state and federal regulators and authorities. In addition, changes in the way regulators administer applicable laws, tax statutes, or regulations could adversely impact our business, cash flows, results of operations, or financial condition.\nThe effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, the business operations of our customers and/or independent agents, or our third-party vendor operations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIf the COVID-19 pandemic results in conditions that constrain the Exchange\u2019s ability to grow its written premiums, our management fee revenue could be negatively impacted. Certain expenses within our cost of operations could increase as a result of the pandemic, including but not limited to agent compensation, technology costs, and potentially healthcare costs, among others. Our agent incentive bonuses include a profitability component. If claims frequency and loss expenses continue to decline, the profitability component of our agent incentive bonuses will continue to improve, increasing our agent compensation costs. Technology costs may continue to increase as a result of supporting remote work capabilities for our employees. If a significant number of our employees and/or their dependents were to become infected, there is a potential for increased healthcare costs for treatments on COVID-19 as well as the potential for increased use of third-party services to maintain service. Also, future pension costs could increase as a result of a lower discount rate or investment returns related to the adverse market conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur business continuity plans were implemented upon the outbreak of this pandemic, including transitioning the vast majority of our employees and third-party contractors to remote work capabilities. We have had no significant interruption to our core business processes or systems to date. We have processes in place with our critical third-party vendors to understand impacts on their business and their business continuity plans. We have had no significant interruption to any third-party vendor relationships, business processes or systems to date. No significant challenges have been identified in our, or our third-party vendor\u2019s ongoing business continuity plans, however if future challenges were to arise, this could result in an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Also, while we have not experienced any delays in internal initiatives to date, future challenges could arise that impact the timing and execution of certain initiatives. Having shifted to remote working arrangements, we also face a heightened risk of cybersecurity attacks or data security incidents. While cyber threats have remained at a constant level, new cybersecurity tactics, techniques, and practices continue to evolve. Additionally, we are more dependent on internet and telecommunications access and capabilities. If we experience difficulties with technology, data and network security, telecommunications access, outsourcing relationships or cloud-based technology, our ability to conduct our business could be negatively impacted.\nIndemnity\u2019s workforce is largely concentrated in Erie, Pennsylvania. If a significant outbreak affects the labor force in this area, or if a significant operating function had a high level of infections at one time, it could impact the policy acquisition, underwriting, claims and/or support services provided to the policyholders of the Exchange and/or our independent agents.\nWith the increasing number of COVID-19 related disputes, there is a risk that Indemnity could become subject to pandemic related litigation. It is also possible that changes in economic conditions and steps taken by federal, state and local governments in response to COVID-19 could require an increase in taxes at the federal, state and local levels, which would adversely impact our results of operations.\nWhile Indemnity\u2019s investment portfolio was negatively impacted by the significant disruption to financial markets in the first quarter of 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, market conditions substantially recovered through the remainder of the year. The value of our invested assets could be adversely impacted and there is potential for further impairments in our investment portfolio as long as market conditions remain volatile in response to the developments of this pandemic and the related economic impacts.\nThe duration and extent of the impact on our business, strategy, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows cannot be estimated with a high degree of certainty at this time given the ongoing developments of this pandemic and the related impacts on the economy and financial markets.\nMarket, Capital, and Liquidity risks\nThe performance of our investment portfolio is subject to a variety of investment risks, which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nAt December 31, 2020, our investment portfolio consisted of approximately 84% fixed maturity securities, with the remaining 16% invested in equity securities and other investments.\nGeneral economic conditions and other factors beyond our control can adversely affect the value of our investments and the realization of net investment income, or result in realized investment losses. In addition, downward economic trends also may have an adverse effect on our investment results by negatively impacting the business conditions and impairing credit for the issuers of securities held in our respective investment portfolios. This could reduce fair values of investments and generate significant unrealized losses or impairment charges which may adversely affect our financial results.\nThe performance of the fixed income portfolio is subject to a number of risks including, but not limited to:\n\u2022Interest rate risk - the risk of adverse changes in the value of fixed income securities as a result of increases in market interest rates.\n\u2022Investment credit risk - the risk that the value of certain investments may decrease due to the deterioration in financial condition of, or the liquidity available to, one or more issuers of those securities or, in the case of structured securities, due to the deterioration of the loans or other assets that underlie the securities, which, in each case, also includes the risk of permanent loss.\n\u2022Sector/Concentration risk - the risk that the portfolio may be too heavily concentrated in the securities of one or more issuers, sectors, or industries. Events or developments that have a negative impact on any particular industry, group of related industries, or geographic region may have a greater adverse effect on our investment portfolio to the extent that the portfolio is concentrated within those issuers, sectors, or industries.\n\u2022Liquidity risk - the risk that we will not be able to convert investment securities into cash on favorable terms and on a timely basis, or that we will not be able to sell them at all, when desired. Disruptions in the financial markets or a lack of buyers for the specific securities that we are trying to sell, could prevent us from liquidating securities or cause a reduction in prices to levels that are not acceptable to us.\n\u2022Reinvestment risk - the possibility that the cash flows produced by an investment will have to be reinvested at a reduced rate of return. Approximately 38% of our fixed maturity portfolio is expected to mature over the next three years.\nOur equity securities have exposure to price risk. Equity markets, sectors, industries, and individual securities may also be subject to some of the same risks that affect our fixed income portfolio, as discussed above.\nAll of our fixed income and equity securities are subject to market volatility. To the extent that future market volatility negatively impacts our investments, our financial condition will be negatively impacted. We review the fixed income portfolio on a continuous basis to evaluate positions that are in an unrealized loss position to determine whether impairments are a result of credit loss or other factors. Inherent in management's evaluation of a security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential. The primary factors considered in our review of investment valuation include the extent to which fair value is less than cost, historical operating performance and financial condition of the issuer, short- and long-term prospects of the issuer and its industry, specific events that occurred affecting the issuer, including rating downgrades, and, depending on the type of security, our intent to sell or our ability and intent to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in value. As the process for determining impairments is highly subjective, changes in our assessments may have a material effect on our operating results and financial condition. See also Part II, Item 7A. \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\".\nIn July 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\"), which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. After this date, the FCA will no longer require banks to make LIBOR submissions. Following discussions with the FCA and other official sector bodies, the Intercontinental Exchange Benchmark Administration announced in November 2020 that it is considering the publication of certain USD LIBOR settings through June 30, 2023. Approximately 23% of our investment portfolio includes securities with LIBOR exposure where the stated final maturity date extends beyond June 30, 2023. For securities without adequate fallback provisions already in place, there are ongoing efforts to establish an alternative reference rate. The transition of our investments to an alternative reference rate may result in adverse changes to the value and return on those investments. Due to uncertainty surrounding alternative rates, we are unable to predict the overall impact of this change at this time.\nDeteriorating capital and credit market conditions or a failure to accurately estimate capital needs may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs and access capital.\nSufficient liquidity and capital levels are required to pay operating expenses, income taxes, and to provide the necessary resources to fund future growth opportunities, satisfy certain financial covenants, pay dividends on common stock, and repurchase common stock. Management estimates the appropriate level of capital necessary based upon current and projected results, which includes evaluating potential risks. Failure to accurately estimate our capital needs may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition until additional sources of capital can be obtained. Further, a deteriorating financial condition may create a negative perception of us by third parties, including investors, and financial institutions, which could impact our ability to access additional capital in the debt or equity markets.\nOur primary sources of liquidity are management fee revenue and cash flows generated from our investment portfolio. In the event our current sources do not satisfy our liquidity needs, we have the ability to access our $100 million bank revolving line of credit, from which there were no borrowings as of December 31, 2020, or liquidate assets in our investment portfolio. Volatility in the financial markets could limit our ability to sell certain of our fixed income securities or cause such investments to sell at deep discounts.\nIn the event these traditional sources of liquidity are not available, we may have to seek additional financing. Our access to funds will depend upon a number of factors including current market conditions, the availability of credit, market liquidity, and the timing of obtaining credit ratings.
