RISK FACTORS.\nYou should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before investing in our common stock. Our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks, and, as a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY\nThe novel coronavirus (COVID-19) global pandemic has had, and is expected to continue to have, material adverse impacts on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe United States and other countries are experiencing a major global health pandemic related to the outbreak of COVID-19, which has resulted in related severe disruptions to retail operations and supply chains and the global economy overall. Governmental authorities across the globe have taken and continue to take dramatic actions to slow down the spread of the disease, at various levels and in different phases across regions. Although restrictions have been eased in many regions and most all of our retail stores have reopened, we may be required to close stores again or adhere to increased operational restrictions including public health directives or quarantine policies. Even in the absence of stringent federal, state or local mandates, continued deterioration in discretionary consumer spending or social distancing measures may extend the duration of the adverse impact on retail traffic in our Company-operated or our customers' retail stores. The extent and magnitude that the impact of COVID-19 will continue to have on our business will depend on various factors, including its duration, severity and any resurgences.\nThe impact of COVID-19 on our business has included, and is expected to continue to include, the following:\n\u2022Retail store closures or reduced operating hours and/or decreased retail traffic;\n\u2022Disruption to our distribution centers and our third-party manufacturing partners and other vendors, including through the effects of facility closures, reductions in operating hours, labor shortages, and real time changes in operating procedures, including for additional cleaning and disinfection procedures;\n\u2022Impacts to our distribution and logistics providers\u2019 ability to operate or increases in their operating costs. These supply chain effects may have an adverse effect on our ability to meet consumer demand, including digital demand, and could result in an increase in our costs of production and distribution, including increased freight and logistics costs and other expenses;\n\u2022Additional expenses as we continue to implement safety measures and other precautions to protect the health and well-being of our employees and customers in our retail stores;\n\u2022Significant disruption of global financial markets, which have increased the cost of accessing capital and could have a negative impact on our ability to access capital in the future; and\n\u2022Negative adverse impacts to the global economy, including decreases or shifts in consumer demand, spending and/or channel preferences.\nWe have taken several measures to respond to operational and financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. At the onset of the pandemic, we temporarily closed almost all Company-operated retail locations to the general public, but have since reopened them in accordance with local guidelines. We have also implemented global travel restrictions, remote work flexibility, and enhanced cleaning and sanitation protocols at our facilities, including offices, manufacturing locations and distribution centers. We have taken several precautionary measures to strengthen our near-term cash position and provide for additional working capital flexibility, including drawdowns from our revolving credit facility during the second quarter of 2020, reductions in select operating and capital expenditures and adjustments in supply chain capacity to better align with demand; however, given the complex and rapidly evolving nature of the pandemic, we may need to take additional actions to respond to the operational and financial impact.\nA prolonged, widespread pandemic will adversely impact global economies and financial markets, which will result in an economic downturn that will reduce demand for our products. These and other impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic could have the effect of heightening many of the other risks set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, such as those relating to our reputation, brands, product sales, results of operations or financial condition. The severity, magnitude and duration of the current COVID-19 pandemic is uncertain, rapidly changing and depends on events beyond our knowledge or control. We might not be able to anticipate or respond to all impacts on a timely basis to prevent near- or long-term adverse impacts to our results. As a result, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, material adverse impacts on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur revenues and profits depend on the level of consumer spending for apparel, which is sensitive to global economic conditions and other factors. A decline in consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe success of our business depends on consumer spending on apparel, and there are a number of factors that influence consumer spending, including actual and perceived economic conditions, disposable consumer income, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, interest rates, consumer credit availability, unemployment, stock market performance, weather conditions, energy prices, consumer discretionary spending patterns and tax rates in the international, national, regional and local markets where our products are sold.\n10 Kontoor Brands, Inc 2020 Form 10-K\nThe current global economic environment is unpredictable, and adverse economic trends or other factors could negatively impact the level of consumer spending, which could have a material adverse impact on us.\nThe apparel industry is highly competitive, and our success depends on our ability to gauge consumer preferences and product trends, and to respond to constantly changing markets.\nWe compete with numerous apparel brands and manufacturers. Competition is generally based upon brand name recognition, price, design, product quality, selection, service and purchasing convenience. Some of our competitors are larger and have more resources than us in certain product categories and regions. In addition, we compete directly with the private label brands of our wholesale customers. Our ability to compete within the apparel industry depends on our ability to:\n\u2022Anticipate and respond to changing consumer preferences and product trends in a timely manner;\n\u2022Develop attractive, innovative and high-quality products that meet consumer needs;\n\u2022Maintain strong brand recognition;\n\u2022Price products appropriately;\n\u2022Provide best-in-class marketing support and intelligence;\n\u2022Ensure product availability and optimize supply chain efficiencies;\n\u2022Adapt to a more digitally driven consumer landscape;\n\u2022Respond to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022Produce or procure quality products on a consistent basis; and\n\u2022Obtain sufficient retail store space and effectively present our products at retail.\nFailure to compete effectively or to keep pace with rapidly changing consumer preferences, markets and product trends could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, there are significant shifts underway in the wholesale and retail (e-commerce and retail store) channels. We may not be able to manage our brands within and across channels sufficiently, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully anticipate changing consumer preferences and product trends or economic conditions, and, as a result, we may not successfully manage inventory levels to meet our future order requirements. We often schedule internal production and place orders for products with independent manufacturers before our customers\u2019 orders are firm. If we fail to accurately forecast consumer demand, we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product required to meet the demand. Inventory levels in excess of consumer demand may result in inventory write-downs, the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices or excess inventory held by our wholesale customers, which could have a negative impact on future sales, an adverse effect on the image and reputation of our brands and negatively impact profitability. On the other hand, if we underestimate demand for our products, our manufacturing facilities or third-party manufacturers may not be able to produce products to meet consumer requirements, and this could result in delays in the shipment of products and lost revenues, higher costs for our freight or expedited shipments, as well as damage to our reputation and relationships. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our brand image as well as our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business and the success of our products could be harmed if we are unable to maintain the images of our brands.\nOur success to date has been due in large part to the growth of our brands\u2019 images and our customers\u2019 connection to our brands. If we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to changing consumer demand, including customers' desire for sustainable products, the names and images of our brands may be impaired. Even if we react appropriately to changes in consumer preferences, consumers may consider our brands\u2019 images to be outdated or associate our brands with styles that are no longer popular. In addition, brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of qualities, including merchandise quality and corporate integrity. Negative claims or publicity regarding us, our brands or our products could adversely affect our reputation and sales regardless of whether such claims are accurate. Social media, which accelerates the dissemination of information, can increase the challenges of responding to negative claims. In the past, many apparel companies have experienced periods of rapid growth in sales and earnings followed by periods of declining sales and losses. Our businesses may be similarly affected in the future. In addition, we have sponsorship contracts with a number of athletes, musicians and celebrities and feature those individuals in our advertising and marketing efforts. Actions taken by those individuals associated with our products could harm their reputations, which could adversely affect the images of our brands.\n11 Kontoor Brands, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K\nOur profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on margins.\nThe apparel industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors, including intense competition, consolidation in the retail industry, rising commodity and conversion costs, pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, changes in consumer demand and shifts to online shopping and purchasing. Customers may increasingly seek markdown allowances, incentives and other forms of economic support. If these factors cause us to reduce our sales prices to retailers and consumers, and we fail to sufficiently reduce our product costs or operating expenses, our profitability will decline. This could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nOur direct-to-consumer business includes risks that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe sell merchandise direct-to-consumer through our e-commerce sites. Our direct-to-consumer business is subject to numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on our results. Risks include, but are not limited to, (i) U.S. or international resellers purchasing merchandise and reselling it overseas outside of our control, (ii) failure of the systems that operate the stores and websites, and their related support systems, including computer viruses, theft of customer information, privacy concerns, telecommunication failures and electronic break-ins and similar disruptions, (iii) credit card fraud and (iv) risks related to our direct-to-consumer distribution centers and processes. Risks specific to our e-commerce business also include (i) diversion of sales from our wholesale customers, (ii) difficulty in recreating the in-store experience through direct channels, (iii) liability for online content, (iv) changing patterns of consumer behavior and (v) intense competition from online retailers. Our failure to successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect sales in our e-commerce business, as well as damage our reputation and brands.\nThe retail industry has experienced financial difficulty that could adversely affect our business.\nRecently there have been consolidations, reorganizations, restructurings, bankruptcies and ownership changes in the retail industry, much of which is a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These events individually, and together, could materially, adversely affect our business. These changes could impact our opportunities in the market and increase our reliance on a smaller number of large customers. In the future, retailers are likely to further consolidate, undergo restructurings or reorganizations or bankruptcies, realign their affiliations or reposition their stores\u2019 target markets. In addition, consumers have continued to transition away from traditional wholesale retailers to large online retailers. These developments could result in a reduction in the number of stores that carry our products, an increase in ownership concentration within the retail industry, an increase in credit exposure to us or an increase in leverage by our customers over their suppliers.\nFurther, the global economy periodically experiences recessionary conditions with rising unemployment, reduced availability of credit, increased savings rates and declines in real estate and securities values. These recessionary conditions could have a negative impact on retail sales of apparel. The lower sales volumes, along with the possibility of restrictions on access to the credit markets, could result in our customers experiencing financial difficulties including store closures, bankruptcies or liquidations. This could result in higher credit risk to us relating to receivables from our customers who are experiencing these financial difficulties. If these developments occur, our inability to shift sales to other customers or to collect on our trade accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur balance sheet includes intangible assets and goodwill. A decline in the fair value of an intangible asset or of a business unit could result in an asset impairment charge, which would be recorded as an operating expense in our statement of operations.\nOur policy is to evaluate indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill for possible impairment as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of such assets may be below their carrying amount. In addition, intangible assets that are being amortized are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. For these impairment tests, we use various valuation methods to estimate the fair value of our business units and intangible assets. If the fair value of an asset is less than its carrying value, we would recognize an impairment charge for the difference. For example, we recorded a $32.6 million non-cash impairment charge related to the Rock & Republic\u00ae trademark intangible asset in 2019. Refer to Note 7 to the Company's financial statements.\nIt is possible that we could have an impairment charge for goodwill or trademark and trade name intangible assets in future periods if (i) overall economic conditions in future years vary from our current assumptions, (ii) business conditions or our strategies for a specific business unit or brand change from our current assumptions, (iii) investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace or (iv) enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies, or of actual sales transactions of comparable companies, were to decline, resulting in lower comparable multiples of net revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and, accordingly, lower implied values of goodwill and intangible assets. Although a charge would be non-cash, a future impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nA significant portion of our revenues and gross profit is derived from a small number of large customers. The loss of any of these customers or the inability of any of these customers to pay us could substantially reduce our revenues and profits.\nA small portion of our customers account for a significant portion of net revenues. Sales to our ten largest customers accounted for 60% of total net revenues in 2020, and our top customer, Walmart, accounted for 38%, 34% and 32% of our total net revenues in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We expect that these customers will continue to represent a significant portion of our net sales in\n12 Kontoor Brands, Inc 2020 Form 10-K\nthe future. Sales to our wholesale customers are generally on a purchase order basis and not subject to long-term agreements. A decision by any of our major wholesale customers to significantly decrease the volume of products purchased from us could substantially reduce net revenues and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our larger customers generally have the scale to develop supply chains that enable them to change their buying patterns, or develop and market their own private label and other economy brands that compete with some of our products. This ability also makes it easier for them to resist our efforts to increase prices, reduce inventory levels and, potentially, discontinue our products. Many of our largest customers have already developed significant private label brands under which they design and market apparel and accessories that compete directly with our products. These retailers have assumed an increasing degree of inventory risk in their private label products and, as a result, may first cancel advance orders with us in order to manage their own inventory levels downward during periods of unseasonable weather or weak economic cycles. In addition, if any of our customers devote less selling space to our categories of apparel, our sales to those customers could be reduced even if we maintain our share of their apparel business. Any such reduction in our categories of apparel selling space could result in lower sales and our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nWe may not succeed in our business strategy.\nOne of our key strategic objectives is growth. We seek to grow organically and potentially, in the future, through acquisitions. We seek to grow by expanding our share with winning customers; stretching brands to new regions, channels, and categories; managing costs; leveraging our supply chain across Kontoor Brands; and expanding our direct-to-consumer business with emphasis on our e-commerce business. However, we may not be able to grow our existing businesses. For example:\n\u2022We may not be able to transform our model to be more consumer- and retail-centric;\n\u2022We may not be able to expand our market share with winning customers, or our wholesale customers may encounter financial difficulties and thus reduce their purchases of our products;\n\u2022We may not be able to expand our brands in Asia or other geographies, transform our business in certain regions or achieve the expected results from our supply chain initiatives;\n\u2022We may not be able to successfully integrate our Wrangler\u00ae and Lee\u00ae brand platforms or achieve the expected growth, cost savings or synergies from such integration;\n\u2022We may have difficulty recruiting, developing or retaining qualified employees;\n\u2022We may not be able to achieve our direct-to-consumer expansion goals and manage our growth effectively;\n\u2022We may not be able to offset rising commodity or conversion costs in our product costs with pricing actions or efficiency improvements;\n\u2022We may have difficulty completing potential acquisitions or dispositions, and we may not be able to successfully integrate a newly acquired business or achieve the expected growth, cost savings or synergies from such integration; and\nFailure to implement our strategic objectives may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe use third-party suppliers and manufacturing facilities worldwide for a substantial portion of our raw materials and finished products, which poses risks to our business operations.\nDuring 2020, approximately 64% of our units were purchased from independent manufacturers primarily located in Asia, with substantially all of the remainder produced by Kontoor Brands-owned and -operated manufacturing facilities located in Mexico and Nicaragua. Any of the following could impact our ability to produce or deliver our products, or our cost of producing or delivering products and, as a result, our profitability:\n\u2022Political or labor instability in countries where our facilities, contractors and suppliers are located;\n\u2022Changes in local economic conditions, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, in countries where our facilities, contractors, and suppliers are located;\n\u2022Political or military conflict could cause a delay in the transportation of raw materials and products to us and an increase in transportation costs;\n\u2022Disruption at domestic and foreign ports of entry could cause delays in product availability and increase transportation times and costs;\n\u2022Heightened terrorism or security concerns could subject imported or exported goods to additional, more frequent or lengthier inspections, leading to delays in deliveries or impoundment of goods for extended periods;\n\u2022Decreased scrutiny by customs officials for counterfeit goods, leading to more counterfeit goods and reduced sales of our products, increased costs for our anti-counterfeiting measures and damage to the reputation of our brands;\n13 Kontoor Brands, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K\n\u2022Disruptions at suppliers and manufacturing or distribution facilities caused by natural and man-made disasters;\n\u2022Disease epidemics and health-related concerns, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, have resulted and could in the future result in closed factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials and scrutiny or embargo of our goods produced in infected areas;\n\u2022Imposition of regulations and quotas relating to imports and our ability to adjust timely to changes in trade regulations could limit our ability to produce products in cost-effective countries that have the required labor and expertise;\n\u2022Imposition of duties, taxes and other charges on imports; and\n\u2022Imposition or the repeal of laws that affect intellectual property rights.\nAlthough no single supplier and no one country is critical to our overall production needs, if we were to lose a supplier it could result in interruption of finished goods shipments to us, cancellation of orders by customers and termination of relationships. This, along with the damage to our reputation, could have a material adverse effect on our net revenues and, consequently, our results of operations.\nIn addition, although we audit our third-party material suppliers and contracted manufacturing facilities and set strict compliance standards, actions by a third-party supplier or manufacturer that fail to comply could expose us to claims for damages, financial penalties and reputational harm, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nFluctuations in wage rates and the price, availability and quality of raw materials, including commodity costs, and finished goods could increase costs.\nFluctuations in the price, availability and quality of fabrics such as denim, including cottons, blends, synthetics, and wools, or other raw materials used by us in our manufactured products, or of purchased finished goods, could have a material adverse effect on our cost of goods sold or our ability to meet our customers\u2019 demands. The prices we pay depend on demand and market prices for the raw materials used to produce them. The price and availability of such raw materials may fluctuate significantly, depending on many factors, including general economic conditions and demand, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, crop yields, energy prices, weather patterns, freight rates and speculation in the commodities markets. Prices of purchased finished products also depend on wage rates in Asia and other geographic areas where our independent contractors are located, as well as freight costs from those regions. Inflation can also have a long-term impact on us because increasing costs of materials and labor may impact our ability to maintain satisfactory margins. For example, the cost of the materials that are used in our manufacturing process, such as oil-related commodity prices and other raw materials, such as cotton, dyes and chemicals, and other costs, such as fuel, energy and utility costs, can fluctuate as a result of inflation and other factors. Similarly, a significant portion of our products are manufactured in other countries and declines in the value of the U.S. dollar may result in higher manufacturing costs. In addition, fluctuations in wage rates required by legal or industry standards could increase our costs. In the future, we may not be able to offset cost increases with other cost reductions or efficiencies or to pass higher costs on to our customers. This could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nWe rely on a limited number of North American mills for raw material sourcing, and we may not be able to obtain raw materials on a timely basis or in sufficient quantity or quality.\nWe rely on a limited number of third-party suppliers for raw materials in North America. Such products may be available, in the short-term, from only one or a very limited number of sources. In 2020, approximately 63% of our raw materials were provided by our top three suppliers in North America. We have no long-term contracts with our suppliers or manufacturing sources, and we compete with other companies for raw materials, production and quota capacity. We may experience a significant disruption in the supply of raw materials from current sources or, in the event of a disruption, we may be unable to locate alternative materials suppliers of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all. In addition, if we experience significant increased demand, or if we need to replace an existing supplier or manufacturer due to consolidation, closure or otherwise, we may be unable to locate additional supplies of raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or we may be unable to locate any supplier or manufacturer with sufficient capacity to meet our requirements or to fill our orders in a timely manner. Identifying a suitable supplier is an involved process that requires us to become satisfied with their quality control, responsiveness and service, financial stability and labor and other ethical practices. Even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing sources, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our suppliers and manufacturers in our methods, products and quality control standards. Delays related to supplier changes could also arise due to an increase in shipping times if new suppliers are located farther away from our markets or from other participants in our supply chain. Any delays, interruption or increased costs in the supply of raw materials or manufacture of our products could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand for our products and could result in lower net revenue and income from operations both in the short and long term.\nIf we encounter problems with our distribution system, our ability to deliver our products to the market could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on owned or independently operated distribution facilities to warehouse and ship product to our customers. Our distribution system includes computer-controlled and automated equipment, which may be subject to a number of risks related to security or\n14 Kontoor Brands, Inc 2020 Form 10-K\ncomputer viruses, the proper operation of software and hardware, power interruptions or other system failures. Because substantially all of our products are distributed from a relatively small number of locations, our operations could also be interrupted by earthquakes, floods, fires or other natural disasters affecting our distribution centers. We maintain business interruption insurance, but it may not adequately protect us from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities, such as the long-term loss of customers or an erosion of brand image. In addition, our distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties, including the transportation of product to and from our distribution facilities. Transportation of our products may be interrupted due to events such as marine disasters, bad weather or natural disasters, mechanical or electrical failures, public health crises, grounding, capsizing, fire, explosions and collisions, piracy, cyber attacks, human error and war and terrorism resulting in delays, damages or losses. If we encounter problems with our distribution system, our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve operating efficiencies could be materially adversely affected.\nOur revenues and cash requirements are affected by seasonality.\nOur business is typically affected by seasonal trends, with a higher proportion of net revenues and operating cash flows generated during the second half of the fiscal year, which typically includes the back-to-school and holiday selling seasons. Poor sales in the second half of the fiscal year would have a material adverse effect on our full year operating results and cause higher inventories. In addition, fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales.\nWe may be adversely affected by unseasonal or severe weather conditions.\nOur business may be adversely affected by unseasonal or severe weather conditions. Periods of unseasonably warm weather in the fall or winter, or periods of unseasonably cool and wet weather in the spring or summer, can negatively impact retail traffic and consumer spending. In addition, severe weather events such as snowstorms or hurricanes typically lead to temporarily reduced retail traffic. Any of these conditions could result in negative point-of-sale trends for our merchandise and reduced replenishment shipments to our wholesale customers.\nWe are in the process of implementing an Enterprise Resource Planning (\"ERP\") software system and challenges with the implementation of the system may impact our business and operations.\nWe are in the process of implementing a company-wide ERP software program and the related infrastructure to support future growth and to integrate our processes. Our ERP software program has involved, and will continue to involve, substantial expenditures on system hardware and software, as well as design, development and implementation activities. The implementation of the ERP software program may prove to be more difficult, costly, or time consuming than expected, and it is possible that the system will not yield the benefits anticipated. Any disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of our new ERP software program could materially impact our operations and adversely affect our ability to process orders, manage our inventory, ship products, provide customer support, fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business. Additionally, future cost estimates related to our new ERP software system are based on assumptions which are subject to wide variability.\nWe rely significantly on information technology. Any inadequacy, interruption, integration failure or security failure of this technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business.\nOur ability to effectively manage and operate our business depends significantly on information technology systems. We rely heavily on information technology to track sales and inventory and manage our supply chain, and the majority of our systems are currently supplied to us by VF pursuant to the TSA associated with the Separation. We are also dependent on information technology, including the Internet, for our direct-to-consumer sales, including our e-commerce operations and retail business credit card transaction authorization. We expect to upgrade or replace many of these systems as we transition from the TSA. Despite our preventative efforts, our systems and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to damage, failure or interruption due to viruses, data security incidents, technical malfunctions, natural disasters or other causes, or in connection with upgrades to our systems or the implementation of new systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, difficulty in integrating new systems or systems of acquired businesses or a breach in security of these systems could adversely impact the operations of our business, including management of inventory, ordering and replenishment of products, manufacturing and distribution of products, e-commerce operations, retail business credit card transaction authorization and processing, corporate email communications and our interaction with the public on social media.\nWe are subject to data security and privacy risks that could negatively affect our business operations, results of operations or reputation.\nIn the normal course of business, we often collect, retain and transmit certain sensitive and confidential customer information, including credit card information, over public networks. There is a significant concern by consumers and employees over the security of personal information transmitted over the Internet, identity theft and user privacy. Data security attacks are increasingly sophisticated, and if unauthorized parties gain access to our networks or databases, or those of our third-party service providers, they may be able to steal, publish, delete or modify our private and sensitive information, including credit card information and personal information. Despite the security measures we currently have in place and our commitment to risk management practices, our facilities and systems and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to, and unable to anticipate or detect, data security breaches and data loss. In addition, employees or third-party service providers may intentionally or inadvertently cause data\n15 Kontoor Brands, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K\nsecurity breaches, through failing to follow polices, trainings, or otherwise, that result in the unauthorized release of personal or confidential information. We take, and require our third-party service providers that store, process or transmit personal or sensitive information on our behalf to take, reasonable measures to protect data and comply with applicable laws related to information security and privacy. But we cannot control the efforts of third-party service providers and cannot guarantee the compliance of their systems and processes. We and our customers could suffer harm if valuable business data or employee, customer and other proprietary information were corrupted, lost or accessed or misappropriated by third parties due to a security failure in our systems or one of our third-party service providers. It could require significant expenditures to remediate any such failure or breach, severely damage our reputation and our relationships with customers, result in unwanted media attention and lost sales and expose us to risks of litigation and liability. In addition, as a result of recent security breaches at a number of prominent retailers, the media and public scrutiny of information security and privacy has become more intense and the regulatory environment has become increasingly uncertain, rigorous and complex. As a result, we may incur significant costs to comply with current and new state, federal, and international laws regarding the protection and unauthorized disclosure of personal and other sensitive information such as the General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union, the United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulation, and state laws in the U.S. related to information security and privacy such as the California Consumer Privacy Act. As the regulatory environment relating to information security and privacy becomes increasingly more demanding with many new requirements surrounding the handling, protection and use of personal and other sensitive information, the increased complexity in these types of laws and inherent conflicts between jurisdictions may result in our inability or failure to comply with applicable requirements, despite our focus and efforts. Any failure to comply with the laws and regulations surrounding the protection of personal information could subject us to legal and reputational risks, including significant fines for non-compliance, any of which could have a negative impact on revenues and profits.\nOur business is exposed to the risks of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Our hedging strategies may not be effective in mitigating those risks.\nApproximately 22% of our total net revenues in 2020 are derived from markets outside the U.S. Our international businesses operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in currency exchange rates affect the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency-denominated amounts at which our international businesses purchase products, incur costs or sell products. In addition, for our U.S.-based businesses, the majority of products are sourced from independent contractors or our manufacturing facilities located in foreign countries. As a result, the costs of these products are affected by changes in the value of the relevant currencies. Furthermore, much of our licensing net revenue is derived from sales in foreign currencies. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn accordance with our operating practices, we plan to hedge a significant portion of our foreign currency transaction exposures arising in the ordinary course of business to reduce risks in our cash flows and earnings. Our hedging strategy may not be effective in reducing all risks, and no hedging strategy can completely insulate us from foreign exchange risk.\nFurther, our use of derivative financial instruments may expose us to counterparty risks. Although we plan to enter only into hedging contracts with counterparties having investment grade credit ratings, it is possible that the credit quality of a counterparty could be downgraded or a counterparty could default on its obligations, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nClimate change, and related legislative and regulatory responses to climate change, may adversely impact our business.\nThere is increasing concern that a gradual rise in global average temperatures due to increased concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will cause significant changes in weather patterns around the globe, an increase in the frequency, severity and duration of extreme weather conditions and natural disasters, and water scarcity and poor water quality. These events could adversely impact the cultivation of cotton, which is a key resource in the production of our products, disrupt the operation of our supply chain and the productivity of our contract manufacturers, increase our production costs, impose capacity restraints and impact the types of apparel products that consumers purchase. These events could also compound adverse economic conditions and impact consumer confidence and discretionary spending. As a result, the effects of climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nIn many countries, governmental bodies are enacting new or additional legislation and regulations to reduce or mitigate the potential impacts of climate change. If we, our suppliers or our contract manufacturers are required to comply with these laws and regulations, or if we choose to take voluntary steps to reduce or mitigate our impact on climate change, we may experience increases in energy, production, transportation and raw material costs, capital expenditures or insurance premiums and deductibles, which could adversely impact our operations. Inconsistency of legislation and regulations among jurisdictions may also affect the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations. Any assessment of the potential impact of future climate change legislation, regulations or industry standards, as well as any international treaties and accords, is uncertain given the wide scope of potential regulatory change in the countries in which we operate.\nOur operations and earnings may be affected by legal, regulatory, political and economic risks.\nOur ability to maintain the current level of operations in our existing markets and to capitalize on growth in existing and new markets is subject to legal, regulatory, political and economic risks. These include the burdens of complying with U.S. and international laws and regulations, unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and the economic uncertainty associated with the recent exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d) or any other similar referendums that may be held.\n16 Kontoor Brands, Inc 2020 Form 10-K\nChanges in regulatory, geopolitical policies and other factors may adversely affect our business or may require us to modify our current business practices. While enactment of any such change is not certain, if such changes were adopted, our costs could increase, which would reduce our earnings.\nChanges to trade policy, including tariff and import/export regulations, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in policies governing foreign trade and manufacturing in the countries where we currently sell our products or conduct our business could adversely affect our business. The U.S. government has instituted or proposed changes in trade policies that include the negotiation or termination of trade agreements, the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the U.S., economic sanctions on individuals, corporations or countries, and other government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries where we conduct our business. It may be time-consuming and expensive for us to alter our operations in order to adapt to or comply with any such changes.\nThe new tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade policy have in the past and could continue to trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, and certain foreign governments have instituted or are considering imposing retaliatory measures on certain U.S. goods. We do a significant amount of business that would be impacted by changes to the trade policies of the U.S. and foreign countries (including governmental action related to tariffs, international trade agreements, or economic sanctions). Such changes have the potential to adversely impact the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof, our industry and the global demand for our products, and as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to comply with anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nWe are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, in addition to the anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and anti-money laundering laws of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate, such as the U.K. Bribery Act. Although we implement policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws and audit our third-party material suppliers and contracted manufacturing facilities, our employees, contractors and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, may take actions in violation of our policies. Any such violation, or allegations of such violation, could result in sanctions or other penalties and have an adverse effect on our business, reputation and operating results.\nChanges in tax laws could increase our worldwide tax rate and materially affect our financial position and results of operations.\nAs a global business, we are subject to taxation in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Many jurisdictions in which we operate are discussing potential changes to their respective taxation regimes or adopting additional regulations. Specifically, countries in the European Union and around the globe have adopted and/or proposed changes to current tax laws. Organizations such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development have published action plans that, if adopted, could increase our tax obligations in countries where we conduct business. Due to the large scale of our global business activities, many of these enacted and proposed changes to the taxation of our activities could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations.\nWe may have additional tax liabilities.\nAs a global company, we determine our income tax liability in various tax jurisdictions based on an analysis and interpretation of local tax laws and regulations. This analysis requires a significant amount of judgment and estimation and is often based on various assumptions about the future actions of the local tax authorities. These determinations are the subject of periodic U.S. and international tax audits. Although we accrue for uncertain tax positions, our accrual may be insufficient to satisfy unfavorable findings. Unfavorable audit findings and tax rulings may result in payment of taxes, fines and penalties for prior periods and higher tax rates in future periods, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur business is subject to national, state and local laws and regulations for environmental, consumer protection, employment, privacy, safety and other matters. The costs of compliance with, or the violation of, such laws and regulations by us or by independent suppliers who manufacture products for us could have a material adverse effect on our operations and cash flows, as well as on our reputation.\nOur business is subject to comprehensive national, state and local laws and regulations on a wide range of environmental, consumer protection, employment, privacy, safety and other matters. We could be adversely affected by costs of compliance with or violations of those laws and regulations. In addition, while we do not control their business practices, we require third-party suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations regarding working conditions, employment practices and environmental compliance. The costs of products purchased by us from independent contractors could increase due to the costs of compliance by those contractors.\nFailure by us or our third-party suppliers to comply with such laws and regulations, as well as with ethical, social, product, labor and environmental standards, or related political considerations, could result in interruption of finished goods shipments to us, cancellation of orders by customers and termination of relationships. If one of our independent contractors violates labor or other laws, implements labor or other business practices or takes other actions that are generally regarded as unethical, it could jeopardize our\n17 Kontoor Brands, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K\nreputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions, including boycotts that may reduce demand for our merchandise. Damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal controls, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or timely or prevent or detect fraud, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or the market price of our securities.\nIn accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our management is required to conduct an annual assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and include a report on these internal controls in our annual reports, and our independent registered public accounting firm is required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls annually. These reporting and other obligations may place significant demands on our management, administrative and operational resources, including accounting systems and resources. We may experience higher than anticipated operating expenses during the implementation of these changes and thereafter. If management or our independent registered public accounting firm determines that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected, and we could become subject to investigations by the SEC, the NYSE or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources. In addition, if our controls are not effective, our ability to accurately and timely report our financial position and results of operations could be impaired, which could result in late filings of our annual and quarterly reports under the Exchange Act, restatements of our combined financial statements, a decline in our stock price, suspension or delisting of our common stock from the NYSE, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations.\nThe loss of members of our executive management and other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe depend on the services and management experience of our executive officers and business leaders who have substantial experience and expertise in our business. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on us. Our future success also depends on our ability to recruit, retain and engage our personnel sufficiently. Competition for experienced and well-qualified personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel.\nMost of the employees in our production and distribution facilities are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and any material job actions could negatively affect our results of operations.\nIn North America, most of our production and distribution employees are covered by various collective bargaining agreements, and outside North America, most of our production and distribution employees are covered by either industry-sponsored and/or government-sponsored collective bargaining mechanisms. Any work stoppages or other job actions by these employees could harm our business and reputation.\nWe may be unable to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights.\nOur trademarks, trade names, patents, and other intellectual property rights are important to our success and our competitive position. We are susceptible to others copying our products and infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating our intellectual property rights, especially with the shift in product mix to higher priced brands and innovative new products in recent years.\nActions we have taken to establish and protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent copying of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to invalidate our trademarks or block sales of our products as a violation of the trademarks and intellectual property rights of others. In addition, unilateral actions in the U.S. or other countries, including changes to or the repeal of laws recognizing trademark or other intellectual property rights, could have an impact on our ability to enforce those rights.\nSome of our brands, such as Wrangler\u00ae and Lee\u00ae, enjoy significant worldwide consumer recognition. The higher pricing of those products creates additional risk of counterfeiting and infringement, misappropriation or other violation by third parties. The counterfeiting of our products or the infringement, misappropriation or other violation of our intellectual property rights by third parties could diminish the value of our brands and adversely affect our net revenues.\nThe value of our intellectual property could diminish if others assert rights in or ownership of our trademarks and other intellectual property rights, or trademarks that are similar to our trademarks. We may be unable to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction. In some cases, there may be trademark owners who have prior rights to our trademarks because the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. In other cases, there may be holders who have prior rights to similar trademarks.\nThere have been, and there may in the future be, opposition and cancellation proceedings from time to time with respect to some of our intellectual property rights. In some cases, litigation may be necessary to protect or enforce our trademarks and other intellectual property rights. Furthermore, third parties may assert intellectual property claims against us, and we may be subject to liability, required to enter into costly license agreements, if available at all, required to rebrand our products and/or prevented from selling some of our products if third parties successfully oppose or challenge our trademarks or successfully claim that we infringe,\n18 Kontoor Brands, Inc 2020 Form 10-K\nmisappropriate or otherwise violate their trademarks, copyrights, patents or other intellectual property rights. Bringing or defending any such claim, regardless of merit, and whether successful or unsuccessful, could be expensive and time-consuming and have a negative effect on our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to the risk that our licensees may not generate expected sales or maintain the value of our brands.\nDuring 2020, we generated $18.7 million in net revenues from licensing royalties. Although we generally have significant control over our licensees\u2019 products and advertising, we rely on our licensees for, among other things, operational and financial controls over their businesses. Failure of our licensees to successfully market licensed products or our inability to replace existing licensees, if necessary, could adversely affect our net revenues, both directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products. Risks are also associated with a licensee\u2019s ability to:\n\u2022Obtain capital;\n\u2022Manage labor relations;\n\u2022Maintain relationships with its suppliers;\n\u2022Manage credit risk effectively;\n\u2022Maintain relationships with its customers; and\n\u2022Adhere to our Global Compliance Principles.\nIn addition, we rely on our licensees to help preserve the value of our brands. Although we attempt to protect our brands through approval rights over design, production processes, quality, packaging, merchandising, distribution, advertising and promotion of our licensed products, we cannot completely control the use of our licensed brands by our licensees. The misuse of a brand by a licensee, including through the marketing of products under one of our brand names that do not meet our quality standards, could have a material adverse effect on that brand and on us.\nRISKS RELATING TO INDEBTEDNESS AND FINANCING\nOur ability to obtain short-term or long-term financing on favorable terms, if needed, could be adversely affected by geopolitical risk and volatility in the capital markets.\nAny disruption in the capital markets, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, could limit the availability of funds or the ability or willingness of financial institutions or investors to extend capital in the future. This could adversely affect our liquidity and funding resources or significantly increase our cost of capital. An inability to access capital and credit markets may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur failure to maintain satisfactory credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity, capital position, borrowing costs and access to capital markets.\nAny downgrades in our credit ratings by the major independent rating agencies could increase the cost of borrowing under any indebtedness we may incur. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings, and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade, may have a negative impact on our liquidity, capital position and access to capital markets.\nWe have debt obligations that could restrict our business and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nOn May 17, 2019, the Company entered into a $1.55 billion senior secured credit facility under which we incurred $1.05 billion of indebtedness under a newly structured third-party debt issuance, the proceeds of which were used primarily to finance a cash transfer to VF in connection with the Separation. At inception, this facility consisted of a five-year $750.0 million term loan A facility (\u201cTerm Loan A\u201d), a seven-year $300.0 million term loan B facility (\u201cTerm Loan B\u201d) and a five-year $500.0 million revolving credit facility (the \u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d) (collectively, the \u201cCredit Facilities\u201d) with the lenders and agents party thereto. The Credit Facilities contain certain affirmative and negative covenants customary for financings of this type, including maintenance of ratios for consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to both consolidated debt and interest and covenants that restrict or limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, incur certain liens, pay dividends, make certain investments, sell certain assets and enter into certain strategic transactions, including mergers and acquisitions. In addition, beginning with the fiscal year ended 2020, the Company is subject to make additional mandatory repayments on Term Loan B if excess cash flow exceeds a specified threshold, as defined in the Credit Agreement. These covenants and restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business, and may limit our ability to react to market conditions or take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. If the Company fails to comply with any covenants, the lenders may terminate their obligation to make advances and declare any outstanding obligations to be immediately due and payable. This debt obligation could restrict our future business strategies and could adversely impact our future results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Additionally, the Separation increased our overall interest expense and decreased the overall debt capacity and commercial credit available to the Company.\n19 Kontoor Brands, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K\nOn May 5, 2020, given the uncertainties of COVID-19 and the associated impact on future results of operations, the Company entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement (the \u201cAmendment\u201d) to address potential financial covenant compliance issues during future reporting periods. The Amendment established a temporary relief period for the Company (the \"Relief Period\") for certain provisions regarding financial covenants. The Company provided written notification to the administrative agent that it had terminated the temporary Relief Period effective February 26, 2021.\nThis level of debt could have significant consequences on our future operations, including:\n\u2022Making it more difficult for us to meet our payment and other obligations under our outstanding debt;\n\u2022Resulting in an event of default if we fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in our debt agreements, which could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable;\n\u2022Reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes;\n\u2022Limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and the general economy; and\n\u2022Placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged.\nAny of the above-listed factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may also incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR COMMON STOCK.\nThe price of our Common Stock has fluctuated significantly and may continue to fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price of our Common Stock has fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate, significantly due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022Fluctuations in our quarterly or annual earnings results or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022Failures of our operating results to meet the estimates of securities analysts or the expectations of our shareholders, or changes by securities analysts in their estimates of our future earnings;\n\u2022Significant changes announced by our customers, suppliers or competitors;\n\u2022Changes in market valuations or earnings of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022Changes in laws or regulations which adversely affect our industry or us;\n\u2022General economic, industry and stock market conditions, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022Future significant sales of our common stock by our shareholders or the perception in the market of such sales;\n\u2022Future issuances of our common stock by us; and\n\u2022The other factors described in these \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThese and other factors may cause the market price and demand for our common stock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock. In addition, in the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. If any of our shareholders brought a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit. Such a lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management from our business.\nThe trading market for our common stock may also be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nProvisions in our amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and certain provisions of North Carolina law could delay or prevent a change in control of Kontoor Brands.\nThe existence of certain provisions of our amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and North Carolina law could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of Kontoor Brands that a shareholder may consider favorable. These include provisions:\n20 Kontoor Brands, Inc 2020 Form 10-K\n\u2022Providing for a classified Board of Directors until our annual meeting of shareholders held in 2023;\n\u2022Providing that our directors may be removed by our shareholders only for cause while our Board is classified;\n\u2022Providing that the removal of our directors with or without cause after our Board is de-classified must be approved by the holders of at least 80% of the voting power of Kontoor Brands;\n\u2022Providing the right to our Board of Directors to issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock without shareholder approval;\n\u2022Authorizing a large number of shares of stock that are not yet issued, which would allow our Board of Directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management, thereby protecting the continuity of our management, or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of us;\n\u2022Prohibiting shareholders from calling special meetings of shareholders or taking action by written consent;\n\u2022Establishing advance notice and other requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by shareholders at our annual shareholder meetings; and\n\u2022Requiring the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of the voting power of Kontoor Brands to approve certain business combinations.\nWe believe these provisions will protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors and by providing our Board of Directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers. However, these provisions apply even if a takeover offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our Board of Directors determines is not in our and our shareholders\u2019 best interests.\nOur amended and restated articles of incorporation designate North Carolina as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our shareholders, which could limit our shareholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us and limit the market price of our common stock.\nPursuant to our amended and restated articles of incorporation, to the fullest extent permitted by law, and unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the North Carolina Business Court (or another state or federal court located in North Carolina, if a dispute does not qualify for designation to the North Carolina Business Court or the North Carolina Business Court otherwise lacks jurisdiction) shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors or officers or other employees to us or our shareholders; (iii) any action asserting a claim against us or any director or officer or other employee of ours arising pursuant to any provision of North Carolina law or our amended and restated articles of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us or any director or officer or other employee of ours relating to the internal affairs doctrine. Our amended and restated articles of incorporation further provide that if an action described in the preceding sentence is filed in a court other than as specified above in the name of any shareholder, such shareholder is deemed to have consented to (i) personal jurisdiction before any state or federal court located in North Carolina, as appropriate, in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce our amended and restated articles of incorporation and (ii) having service of process made upon such shareholder in any such action by service upon such shareholder\u2019s counsel in the action as agent for such shareholder. The forum selection clause in our amended and restated bylaws may limit our shareholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us and limit the market price of our common stock.\nOur common stock is and will be subordinate to all of our future indebtedness and any preferred stock, and effectively subordinated to all indebtedness and preferred equity claims against our subsidiaries.\nShares of our common stock are common equity interests in us and, as such, will rank junior to all of our future indebtedness and other liabilities. Additionally, holders of our common stock may become subject to the prior dividend and liquidation rights of holders of any class or series of preferred stock that our Board of Directors may designate and issue without any action on the part of the holders of our common stock. Furthermore, our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon any of our subsidiaries\u2019 liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of that subsidiary\u2019s creditors and preferred shareholders.\n21 Kontoor Brands, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K\nWe cannot assure shareholders that our Board of Directors will declare dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWhile we currently return capital to shareholders through quarterly cash dividends, our Board of Directors may not declare dividends in the future or may decrease the amount of a dividend as compared to a prior period. Under the terms of the amendment to our Credit Facilities, dividend payments were suspended for the second and third quarters of 2020, with the opportunity to be re-evaluated after the third quarter based on achievement of certain levels of covenant compliance, which were attained based on third quarter results. However, the declaration and amount of any future dividends will be determined and subject to authorization by our Board of Directors and will be dependent upon multiple factors including our financial condition, earnings, cash flows, capital requirements, our ability to obtain debt and equity financing on acceptable terms as contemplated by our growth strategy and the terms of our outstanding indebtedness, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice and any other factors or considerations that our Board of Directors deems relevant. We may incur expenses or liabilities or be subject to other circumstances in the future that reduce or eliminate the amount of cash that we have available for distribution as dividends, including as a result of the risks described herein.\nRISKS RELATING TO THE SEPARATION.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits from the Separation, which could harm our business.\nWe may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the Separation, or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all. The Separation is expected to enhance strategic and management focus, provide a distinct investment identity and allow us to efficiently allocate resources and deploy capital. We may not achieve these and other anticipated benefits.\nIf we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits expected to result from the Separation, or if such benefits are delayed, our business could be harmed.\nOur historical combined financial information for the periods prior to the Separation is not necessarily representative of the results that we would have achieved as an independent, publicly traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results.\nOur historical combined financial information for the periods prior to the Separation included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K was derived from VF\u2019s consolidated financial statements and accounting records and are not necessarily indicative of our future results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, nor do they reflect what our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows would have been as an independent public company during the periods presented. Such historical combined financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is not necessarily indicative of our future results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nVF continues to perform functions for us on a transitional basis, and we may incur significant costs to perform these functions ourselves following the transition period.\nVF historically performed many important corporate functions for us, including internal audit, finance, accounting, tax, human resources, procurement, information technology, information security, supply chain, logistics, distribution, litigation management, real estate, environmental and public affairs. Following the Separation, VF has continued to provide some of these services to us on a transitional basis, following the transfer of VF's assets and liabilities related to Kontoor Brands or its subsidiaries (the \"Restructuring\") and VF\u2019s distribution to its shareholders of all the shares of Kontoor Brands\u2019 common stock (the \"Distribution\") pursuant to a Transition Services Agreement that we entered into with VF. We have a two-year Transition Services Agreement and have extended it by up to three months for certain services. VF may not successfully execute all of these functions during the transition period or we may have to expend significant efforts or costs materially in excess of those estimated under the Transition Services Agreement. Any interruption in these services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn addition, at the end of this transition period, we will need to perform these functions ourselves or hire third parties to perform these functions on our behalf. The costs associated with performing or outsourcing these functions may exceed the amounts reflected in our historical combined financial statements that were incurred as a business segment of VF. We began to incur costs in the second quarter of 2019 to establish the necessary infrastructure. A significant increase in the costs of performing or outsourcing these functions could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn connection with the Separation, VF has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities and we have agreed to indemnify VF for certain liabilities. If we are required to act under these indemnities to VF, we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations, which could adversely affect our financial results. Moreover, the VF indemnity may not be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of liabilities for which it will be allocated responsibility, and VF may not be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations to us in the future.\nPursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement and other agreements with VF, VF has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities, and we have agreed to indemnify VF for certain liabilities. Payments that we may be required to provide under indemnities to VF are not subject to any cap, may be significant and could negatively affect our business, particularly under indemnities relating to our actions that could affect the tax-free nature of the Separation. Third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for the liabilities that VF has agreed to retain, and under certain circumstances, we may be subject to continuing contingent liabilities of VF that arise relating to our operations during the time that we were a business segment of VF, such as certain tax liabilities which relate to periods during which our taxes were reported as a part of VF; liabilities retained by VF which relate to contracts or other obligations entered\n22 Kontoor Brands, Inc 2020 Form 10-K\ninto jointly by our and VF\u2019s retained business; pension and other post-employment liabilities, including unfunded liabilities, that apply to VF, including Kontoor; environmental liabilities related to sites at which both VF and Kontoor operated; and liabilities arising from third-party claims in respect of contracts in which both VF and Kontoor supplied goods or provided services.\nVF has agreed to indemnify us for certain of such contingent liabilities. While we have no reason to expect that VF will not be able to support its indemnification obligations to us, we can provide no assurance that VF will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations or that such indemnity obligations will be sufficient to cover our liabilities for matters which VF has agreed to retain, including such contingent liabilities. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from VF any amounts for which we are indemnified, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. Each of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe only have limited access to the insurance policies maintained by VF for events occurring prior to the Separation and VF\u2019s insurers may deny coverage to us under such policies.\nIn connection with the Separation, we entered into agreements with VF to address several matters associated with the Separation, including insurance coverage. The Separation and Distribution Agreement provides that Kontoor Brands no longer has insurance coverage under VF insurance policies in connection with events occurring before, as of or after the Distribution, other than coverage for (i) events occurring prior to the Distribution and covered by occurrence-based policies of VF as in effect as of the Distribution and (ii) events or acts occurring prior to the Distribution and covered by claims-made policies of VF as in effect as of the Distribution. However, VF\u2019s insurers may deny coverage to us for losses associated with occurrences prior to the Separation. Accordingly, we may be required to temporarily or permanently bear the costs of such lost coverage. Additionally, claims for losses associated with occurrences prior to the Separation may result in a substantial increase in our insurance premiums.\nSome of our directors and officers may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their equity ownership in VF.\nBecause of their current or former positions with VF, some of our directors and executive officers own shares of VF common stock and / or have options to acquire shares of VF common stock, and the individual holdings may be significant for some of these individuals compared to their total assets. This ownership may create actual or, the appearance of conflicts of interest when these directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for VF or us. For example, potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute that may arise between VF and us regarding the terms of the agreements governing the Separation and the relationship thereafter between the companies.\nIf the Restructuring and Distribution, together with certain related transactions, do not qualify as transactions that are tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes or non-U.S. tax purposes, VF and/or holders of VF common stock could be subject to significant tax liability.\nIt is intended that the Distribution, together with certain related transactions, will qualify as a tax-free \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\") and a tax-free distribution within the meaning of Section 355 of the Code. The consummation of the Separation and the related transactions was conditioned upon the receipt of opinions of certain of our tax advisers to the effect that such transactions would qualify for this intended tax treatment. In addition, it is intended that the Restructuring steps will qualify as transactions that are tax-free for U.S. federal income tax and applicable non-U.S. tax purposes. The opinions relied on certain representations, assumptions and undertakings, including those relating to the past and future conduct of our business, and the opinions would not be valid if such representations, assumptions and undertakings were incorrect. Notwithstanding the opinions, the IRS could determine that the Distribution should be treated as a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes if it determines that any of the representations, assumptions or undertakings that were relied on for the opinions are false or have been violated, if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinions, or for other reasons, including as a result of significant changes in the stock ownership of VF or us after the Distribution.\nIf the Restructuring and Distribution fail to qualify for tax-free treatment, for any reason, VF and/or holders of VF common stock would be subject to substantial U.S. and/or applicable non-U.S. taxes as a result of the Restructuring, Distribution and certain related transactions, and we could incur significant liabilities under applicable law or as a result of the Tax Matters Agreement.\nWe are subject to significant restrictions on our actions in order to avoid triggering significant tax-related liabilities.\nThe Tax Matters Agreement generally prohibits us from taking certain actions that could cause the Distribution and certain related transactions to fail to qualify as tax-free transactions, including:\n\u2022During the two-year period following the date of the Distribution (or otherwise pursuant to a \u201cplan\u201d within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code), we may not cause or permit certain business combinations or transactions to occur;\n\u2022During the two-year period following the date of the Distribution, we may not discontinue the active conduct of our business (within the meaning of Section 355(b)(2) of the Code);\n\u2022During the two-year period following the date of the Distribution, we may not sell or otherwise issue our common stock, other than pursuant to issuances that satisfy certain regulatory safe harbors set forth in Treasury regulations related to stock issued to employees and retirement plans;\n23 Kontoor Brands, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K\n\u2022During the two-year period following the date of the Distribution, we may not redeem or otherwise acquire any of our common stock, other than pursuant to open-market repurchases of less than 20% of our common stock (in the aggregate);\n\u2022During the two-year period following the date of the Distribution, we may not amend our articles of incorporation (or other organizational documents) or take any other action, whether through a shareholder vote or otherwise, affecting the voting rights of our common stock; and\n\u2022More generally, we may not take any action that could reasonably be expected to cause the Separation and certain related transactions to fail to qualify as tax-free transactions for U.S. federal income tax purposes or for non-U.S. tax purposes.\nIf we take any of the actions above and such actions result in tax-related losses to VF, we generally will be required to indemnify VF for such tax-related losses under the Tax Matters Agreement. Due to these restrictions and indemnification obligations under the Tax Matters Agreement, we may be limited in our ability to pursue strategic transactions, equity or convertible debt financings or other transactions that may otherwise be in our best interests. Also, our potential indemnity obligation to VF might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control that our shareholders may consider favorable.", "PERMNO": 18578, "SIC": 2300, "TIC": "KTB"}
