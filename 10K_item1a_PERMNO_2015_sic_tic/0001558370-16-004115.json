{"cik": "1013880", "company": "TELETECH HOLDINGS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-14", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties discussed in this section when evaluating our business. If any of these risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations (including revenue and profitability) could be materially adversely affected and the market price of our stock may decline.\nOur markets are highly competitive and we might not be able to compete effectively\nThe markets where we offer our services are highly competitive. Our future performance is largely dependent on our ability to compete successfully in markets we currently serve, while expanding into new, profitable markets. We compete with large multinational service providers (including the service arms of global technology providers); offshore service providers from lower-cost jurisdictions that offer similar services, often at highly competitive prices and more aggressive contract terms; niche solution or service providers that compete with us in a specific geographic markets, industry segments or service areas, including companies that rely on new technologies or delivery models; and in-house functions of large companies that use their own resources, rather than outsourcing customer care services we provide. Some of our competitors have greater financial or marketing resources than we do and, therefore, may be better able to compete.\nFurther, the continuing trend of consolidation in the technology sector and among business process outsourcing competitors in various geographies where we have operations may result in new competitors with greater scale, a broader footprint, better technologies and price efficiencies attractive to our clients. If we are unable to compete successfully and provide our clients with superior service and solutions at competitive prices, we could lose market share and clients to competitors, which would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf the TeleTech leadership team is unsuccessful in implementing our business strategy or if our new investments are not successful, our financial condition could be adversely affected\nOur growth strategy included a diversification of our business beyond contact center customer care outsourcing to an integrated customer experience platform that unites innovative technologies, strategic consulting, data analytics, digital marketing, client growth solutions, and customer care focused system design and integration. The strategy also includes an accelerated investment in the development of proprietary technologies, and the deployment of a multi business line sales function. These investments in technologies, integrated solution development and sales, however, may not lead to increased revenue and profitability as we may not be successful in deploying our new products and services. If we are not successful in creating value from these investments, the investments and lack of new integrated sales could have a negative impact on our operating results and financial condition.\nOur profitability could suffer if our cost-management strategies are unsuccessful\nOur ability to improve or maintain our profitability is dependent on our ability to successfully manage our costs. Our cost management strategies include optimizing the alignment between the demand for our services and our resource capacity, the costs of service delivery, the cost of sales, and general and administrative costs, as a percentage of revenues. If we are not effective in managing our operating and administrative costs in response to changes in demand and pricing for our services; if we are unable to absorb or pass on to our clients the increases in our costs of operations, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nCyber attacks on our systems and disclosure of personal information could result in harm to our reputation, legal liability, and service outages, any of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations\nOur business is dependent upon our information technology systems. Information security breaches, computer viruses, interruption or loss of business data, DDoS (denial of service) attacks, and other cyber attacks on any of these systems could disrupt the normal operations of our contact centers, our cloud platform offerings, and our enterprise services, impeding our ability to provide critical services to our clients and preventing key personnel from being able to perform their duties or communicate within our organization. Our business involves the use, storage and transmission of information about our clients, customers of our clients, and our employees. While we take reasonable measures to protect the security of and unauthorized access to our systems and the privacy of personal and proprietary information that we access and store, our security controls over our systems may not prevent the improper access to or disclosure of this information. Such unauthorized access or disclosure subject us to liability under our contracts and laws, and could harm our reputation resulting in loss of revenue, and loss of business opportunities.\nIn recent years there have been an increasing number of high profile security breaches at private and public companies and government agencies, and security experts have warned about the growing risks of hackers, cyber criminals and a broad range of potential attacks targeting information technology systems. While we have taken measures to protect our systems from intrusion, we cannot be certain that advances in cyber criminal capabilities, discovery of new system vulnerabilities, and attempts to exploit such vulnerabilities will not compromise or breach the technology protecting our systems and the information that we manage and control. Cyber attacks may force us to expend significant additional resources in response to system disruptions or security breaches, including additional investments in repairing system damage, reconfiguring and rerouting systems to reduce vulnerabilities; cyber security protection costs, and litigation and resolution of related legal claims. A significant security breach could materially harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur results of operations and ability to grow could be materially adversely affected if we cannot adapt our services offerings to changes in technology\nOur success depends on our ability to develop and implement technology, consulting and outsourcing services and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology. Areas of significant change include mobility, cloud-based computing, and processing and analyzing large and unstructured data. Our growth and profitability will depend on our ability to develop and adopt new technologies that expand our existing solutions and service offerings to leverage new technological trends and developments, and achieve cost efficiencies in our operations. We may not be successful in anticipating or responding to new technology developments and our integration of new technologies may not achieve their intended cost reductions. Services and technologies offered by our competitors may make our service offerings obsolete. Our failure to innovate, maintain technological advantage, or respond effectively and timely to transformational changes in technology could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur cloud solutions present execution and competitive risks\nWe are devoting significant resources to extend our current cloud solutions which are and will continue to be materially dependent upon certain third party infrastructure and licensed software. There can be no assurance that such third parties will continue to support and maintain their products and services. In addition to certain software development costs, we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services.\nCertain new competitors offer alternative cloud-based services for consumers and business customers. While we believe our expertise, investments in infrastructure, and the breadth of our cloud-based services provide us with a solid foundation to compete, it is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to be successful.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain industry leaders for key positions in our business, our business and our strategy execution can be adversely impacted\nOur business success depends on contributions of senior management and key personnel. Our ability to attract, motivate and retain key senior management staff is conditioned on our willingness to pay adequate compensation and incentives. We compete for top senior management candidates with other, often larger, companies that at times have access to greater resources. Our ability to attract senior management is also impacted by our requirement that members of senior management sign non-compete agreements as a condition to joining TeleTech. If we are not able to attract and retain industry leaders, we would be unable to compete effectively and our growth may be limited, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and prospects.\nA large portion of our revenue is generated from a limited number of clients and the loss of one or more of our clients could cause adversely effect on our business\nWe rely on strategic, long-term relationships with large, global companies in targeted industries. As a result, we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from relatively few clients. Our five and ten largest clients collectively represented 35% and 48% of our revenue in 2015 while the largest client represented 10% of our revenue in 2015.\nAlthough we have multiple engagements with each of our largest clients and all contracts are unlikely to terminate at the same time, the contracts with our five largest clients expire between 2016 and 2020 and there can be no assurance that these contracts will continue to be renewed at all or be renewed on favorable terms. The loss of all or part of a major client\u2019s business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, if the loss of revenue was not replaced with profitable business from other clients.\nWe serve clients in industries that have historically experienced a significant level of consolidation. If one of our clients is acquired by another company (including another one of our clients) our business volume and revenue may materially decrease due to the termination or phase out of an existing client contract, volume discounts or other contract concessions which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur delivery model involves geographic concentration exposing us to significant operational risks\nOur business model is dependent on our service delivery centers and enterprise support functions being located in low cost jurisdictions around the globe. We have presence in 24 countries, but our customer care management delivery capacity and our back office functions are concentrated in the Philippines and Latin America, and our technology solutions delivery centers are concentrated in a few locations in the United States. Natural disasters (floods, winds and earthquakes), terrorist attacks, pandemics, insufficient infrastructure (large-scale utilities outages, telecommunication and transportation disruptions), labor or political unrest, and restriction on repatriation of funds at some of these locations may interrupt or limit our ability to operate or may increase our costs. Our business continuity and disaster recovery plans, while extensive, may not be effective, particularly if catastrophic events occur.\nOur dependence on our delivery centers and enterprise services support functions in the Philippines, which is subject to frequent severe weather, natural disasters, and occasional security threats, represents a particular risk. This geographic concentration could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although we procure business interruption insurance to cover some of these exposures, adequate insurance may not be available on an ongoing basis for a reasonable price.\nOur growth of operations could strain our resources and cause our business to suffer\nWe plan to continue growing our business organically through aggressive expansion and sales efforts and through strategic acquisitions, while maintaining tight controls on our expenses and overhead. Lean overhead functions combined with focused growth may place a strain on our management systems, infrastructure and resources, resulting in internal control failures, missed opportunities, and staff attrition which could impact our business and results of operations.\nOur results of operation and share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting and we are not able to prevent or timely detect all errors or acts of fraud\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. As disclosed in Item 9A. Controls and Procedures, our management has identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting related to the effectiveness of our control environment and controls over account reconciliations, journal entries, revenue, and impairments.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement in our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As a result of the material weaknesses discussed above, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2015. Although we are taking remedial actions in response to the identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, there can be no assurances that we will be able to prevent future control deficiencies, including material weaknesses, from occurring, nor that our remediation actions will be successful. If additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements. These misstatements could result in restatements of our consolidated financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could lead to a decline in our stock price.\nAny internal and disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Inherent limitations within a control system include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by individuals acting alone or in collusion with others to override controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in the design of a cost effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not always be prevented or timely detected, even if we are successful in remediating the material weaknesses previously identified by management.\nOur financial results depend on our capacity utilization and our ability to forecast demand and make timely decisions about staffing levels, investments and operating expenses\nOur ability to meet our strategic growth and profitability objectives depends on how effectively we manage our contact center capacity against the fluctuating and seasonal client demands. Predicting customer demand and making timely staffing level decisions, investments and other operating expenditure commitments in each of our delivery center locations is key to our successful project execution and profitability maximization. We can provide no assurance that we will continue to be able to achieve or maintain desired delivery center capacity utilization, because quarterly variations in client volumes, many of which are outside our control, can have a material adverse effect on our utilization rates. If our utilization rates are below expectations, because of our very high fixed costs of operation, our financial conditions and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf we cannot recruit, hire, train, and retain qualified employees in balance with the demand of our clients, our business will be adversely affected\nOur business is labor intensive and our ability to locate and train employees with the right skills at the right price point is critical to achieving our growth objective. Demand for qualified personnel with multiple language capabilities and fluency in English may exceed supply. Employees with new backgrounds and skills may also be required to keep pace with evolving technologies and client demands. While we invest and make progress in employee retention, we continue to experience high employee turnover and are continuously recruiting and training replacement staff. Some of our facilities are located in geographies with low unemployment, which makes it costly to hire personnel, and in several jurisdictions, jurisdiction-specific wage regulations are changing quickly which make it difficult to recruit new employees. Our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel at costs acceptable under our contracts, our costs associated with attracting, training, and retaining employees, and the challenge of managing the continuously changing and seasonal client demands could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur commercial success is subject to the terms of our client contracts, many of which can increase the volatility of our revenue and could impact our margins\nMany of our contracts have termination for convenience clauses, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation. Although many of our contracts can be terminated for convenience, our relationships with our top five clients have ranged from two to 19 years with the majority of these clients having completed multiple contract renewals with us. Yet, our contracts, do not guarantee a minimum revenue level or profitability, and clients may terminate them or materially reduce customer interaction volumes, which would reduce our earning potential. This could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and makes it harder to make projections.\nMany of our contracts utilize performance pricing that link some of our fees to the attainment of performance criteria, which could increase the variability of our revenue and operating margin. A majority of our contracts include performance clauses that condition our fees on the achievement of agreed-upon performance criteria. These performance criteria can be complex, and at times they are not entirely within our control. If we fail to satisfy our contract performance metrics, our revenue under the contracts and our operating margin are reduced.\nWe may not always offset increased costs with increased fees under long-term contracts. The pricing and other terms of our client contracts, particularly our long-term contact center agreements, are based on estimates and assumptions we make at the time we enter into these contracts. These estimates reflect our best judgments regarding the nature of the engagement and our expected costs to provide the contracted services and could differ from actual results. Not all our larger long-term contracts allow for escalation of fees as our cost of operations increase. While many of our contracts allow periodic fee adjustments based on increases in certain price indices, in the past several years, our payroll costs, including healthcare costs, have increased at rates much greater than increases in these indices. If we cannot negotiate long-term contract terms that provide for fee adjustments to reflect increases in our cost of service delivery, our business, financial conditions and results of operation would be materially impacted.\nOur contracts seldom address the impacts of currency fluctuation on our costs of delivery. As we continue to leverage our global delivery model, more of our expenses may be incurred in currencies other than those in which we bill for services. An increase in the value of certain currencies, such as Australian dollar against the US dollar and Philippine peso, could increase costs for our delivery at offshore sites by increasing our labor and other costs that are denominated in local currencies. Our contractual provisions, cost management efforts, and currency hedging activities may not be able to offset the currency fluctuation impact, resulting in the decrease of the profitability of our contracts.\nOur pricing depends on effectiveness of our forecasting of the level of effort. Pricing for our services in our technology and strategic consulting businesses is highly contingent on our ability to accurately forecast the level of effort and cost necessary to deliver our services, which is data dependent and could turn out to be materially inaccurate. The inaccurate level of effort in project estimates could yield lower profit margins or become unprofitable, resulting in adverse impacts on our results of operations.\nWe face special risks associated with our business outside of the United States\nAn important component of our growth strategy is service delivery outside of the United States and our continuing international expansion. In 2015 we derived approximately 47% of our revenue from operations outside of the United States. Conducting business abroad is subject to a variety of risks, including:\n\u00b7\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations, restrictions on currency movement, and impact of international tax laws could adversely affect our results of operations, if we are forced to maintain assets in currencies other than the US dollars, while our financial results are reported in US dollars;\n\u00b7\nlonger payment cycles and/or difficulties in accounts receivable collections could impact our cash flows and results of operations;\n\u00b7\npolitical and economic instability and unexpected changes in regulatory regimes could adversely affect our ability to deliver services overseas and our ability to repatriate cash;\n\u00b7\ninconsistent regulations, licensing and legal requirements may increase our cost of operations as we endeavor to comply with multiple, complex laws that differ from one country to another;\n\u00b7\nterrorist attacks and civil unrests in some of the countries where we do business (e.g. tension in the Middle East and Latin America, and terror attacks in Europe), and the resulting need for enhanced security measures may impact our ability to deliver services, threaten the safety of our employees, and increase our costs of operations; and\n\u00b7\nspecial challenges in managing risks inherent in international operations, such as unique and prescriptive labor rules and corrupt business environments may cause an inadvertent violation of laws that we may not be able to immediately detect or correct.\nWhile we monitor and endeavor to mitigate timely the relevant regulatory, geopolitical, and other risks related to our operations outside of the United States, we cannot assess with certainty what impact such risks are likely to have over time on our business, and we can provide no assurance that we will always be able to mitigate these risks successfully and avoid material impact to our business and results of operations.\nUncertainty of tax regulations and treatment of permanent establishments in certain countries where we do business may affect our taxation levels and affect our ability to collect for services rendered\nCurrently, we operate in multiple countries, in entity forms and under laws that are advantageous to us, from operational and tax perspectives. Any changes in the regulatory frameworks in the countries where we currently operate could lead to higher taxation levels, change in our legal operating status, or lead to higher costs associated with maintaining certain entities, which may materially affect our business, operating costs, and results of operations.\nOur strategy of growing through selective acquisitions and mergers involves risks of failing to successfully identify, acquire and integrate businesses and realize returns on our investments\nWe evaluate opportunities to expand the scope of our services through acquisitions and mergers. Yet, we may be unable to identify companies that complement our strategies and which are available to be acquired at valuation levels accretive to our business.\nOur acquisition strategy involves other potential risks, including the inability to integrate acquired companies effectively and realize the full amounts of anticipated synergies and benefits from the acquisitions; the diversion of management\u2019s attention to the integration of the acquired businesses at the expense of delivering results for the legacy business; the risk that we will not be able to retain key employees of the acquired business or that they will not be effective as part of TeleTech operations; the impact of liabilities of the acquired business undiscovered or underestimated as part of the acquisition due diligence; and the unforeseen difficulties experienced by the acquired operations due to the acquisition or the integration which could result in short or longer term effects on our operating results.\nCorporate social engineering attacks and other phishing scams aimed at the company may result in the inadvertent loss of cash and cash equivalent resources\nThe increased activity and sophistication of corporate social engineering attacks and other phishing scams in recent months have increased the risk of inadvertent transfer of large amounts of cash and cash equivalents from the various bank accounts we have around the world. We actively train and inform our employees and key personnel about these risks and, while we have implemented a series of measures to curb these risks, the very nature of these attacks may deceive one or more employees, thereby resulting in a material loss.\nIntellectual property infringement by us and by others may adversely impact our ability to innovate and compete\nOur services or solutions could infringe intellectual property of others impacting our ability to deploy them with clients. There can be no assurance that services and solutions we utilize in our business or offer to clients do not infringe the intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, we and members of our supply chain receive assertions that our service offerings or technologies infringe on the patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. These claims could require us to cease activities, incur expensive licensing costs, or engage in costly litigation, which could adversely affect our business and results of operation.\nOur intellectual property may not always receive favorable treatment from the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the European Patent Office or similar foreign intellectual property adjudication and registration agencies; and our \u201cpatent pending\u201d intellectual property may not receive a patent or may be subject to prior art limitations. The lack of legal system sophistication in certain countries where we do business or lack of commitment to protection of intellectual property rights, may prevent us from being able to defend our intellectual property and related technology against infringement by others, leading to a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIncreases in the cost of communication and data services or significant interruptions in such services could adversely affect our business\nOur business is significantly dependent on telephone, internet and data service provided by various domestic and foreign communication companies. Any disruption of these services could adversely affect our business. We have taken steps to mitigate our exposure to service disruptions by investing in complex and multi-layered redundancies, and we can transition services among different of our contact centers around the world. Despite these efforts, there can be no assurance, however, that the redundancies we have in place would be sufficient to maintain operations without disruption.\nOur inability to obtain communication and data services at favorable rates could negatively affect our business results. Where possible, we have entered into long-term contracts with various providers to mitigate short term rate increases and fluctuations. There is no obligation, however, for the vendors to renew their contracts with us, or to offer the same or lower rates in the future, and such contracts are subject to termination or modification for various reasons outside of our control. A significant increase in the cost of communication services that is not recoverable through an increase in the price of our services could adversely affect our business.\nOur financial results may be adversely impacted by foreign currency exchange rate risk\nMany contracts that we service from delivery centers outside of the United States (for example in Bulgaria, Canada, Costa Rica, Mexico, and the Philippines) are typically priced, invoiced, and paid in U.S. and Australian dollars, and Euro, while the costs incurred to operate these delivery centers are denominated in the functional currency of the applicable operating subsidiary. The fluctuations between the currencies of the contract and operating currencies present foreign currency exchange risks. Furthermore, because our financial statements are denominated in US dollars, but approximately 23% of our revenue is derived from contracts denominated in other currencies, our results of operations could be adversely affected if the US dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies.\nWhile we hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to continue to successfully manage this foreign currency exchange risk and avoid adverse impacts on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nCompliance with laws, including unexpected changes to such laws could adversely affect our results of operations\nOur business is subject to extensive regulation by U.S. and foreign national, state and provincial authorities relating to confidential client and customer data, customer communications, telemarketing practices, and licensed healthcare and financial services activities, among other areas. Costs and complexity of compliance with existing and future regulations could adversely affect our profitability. If we fail to comply with regulations relevant to our business, we could be subject to civil or criminal liability, monitory damages and fines. Private lawsuits and enforcement actions by regulatory agencies may materially increase our costs of operations and impact our ability to serve our clients.\nAs we provide services to clients\u2019 customers residing in over 80 countries, we are subject to numerous, and sometimes conflicting, legal regimes on matters as diverse as import/export controls, communication content requirements, trade restrictions and sanctions, tariffs, taxation, data privacy, labor relations, wages and severance, health care requirements, internal and disclosure control obligations, and immigration. Violations of these regulations could impact our reputation and result in financial liability, criminal prosecution, unfavorable publicity, restrictions on our ability to process information and breach of our contractual commitments.\nAdverse changes in laws or regulations that impact our business may negatively affect the sale of our services, slow the growth of our operations, or mandate changes to how we deliver our services, including our ability to use offshore resources. These changes could threaten our ability to continue to serve certain markets.\nVolatile and uncertain economic conditions and effect of these conditions on our clients could have an adverse effect on the profitability of our business\nEver changing and increasingly unstable global economic conditions affect our clients\u2019 businesses and may, therefore, affect our business and our profitability. We generate revenue based, in large part, on the amount of time our employees devote to our clients\u2019 customers, and our clients\u2019 willingness to invest in their customer relationships. Consequently, our revenue depends on consumers\u2019 interest in and use of our clients\u2019 products and services, which may be adversely affected by general economic conditions. Uncertain economic conditions and slow economic recovery may impact our clients\u2019 willingness to procure our technology and strategic consulting services and may impact products and services that require their customers to use our customer care services. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely affected if any of our major clients were unable to pay for our services due to volatile economic conditions.\nThe current trend to outsource customer care may not continue and the prices that clients are willing to pay for the services may diminish, adversely affecting our business\nOur growth depends, in large part, on the willingness of our clients and potential clients to outsource customer care and management services to companies like TeleTech. There can be no assurance that the customer care outsourcing trend will continue; and our clients and potential clients may elect to perform in-house customer care and management services that they currently outsource. Reduction in demand for our services and increased competition from other providers and in-house service alternatives would create pricing pressures and excess capacity that could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nUnfavorable regulation and negative public perception about digital marketing could adversely affect our business and results of operations\nWith the growth of online marketplace and e-commerce, there is increasing awareness and concern among the general public, privacy advocates, mainstream media, and government bodies regarding the reach of digital marketing and its potential impact on individual privacy interests. For example, in recent years, consumer advocates and certain government agencies have publicly criticized companies that collect, store and use personal data for commercial purposes. This public scrutiny may lead to unfavorable regulation, public distrust of digital marketing industry, consumer reluctance to share and permit use of personal data, and increased consumer opt-out rates, any of which could negatively influence, change or reduce our ability to provide our digital marketing and related analytics services and current and prospective clients\u2019 demand for our offerings, adversely affecting our business and results of operations. Any unfavorable publicity or negative public perception about us or the digital marketing industry in general may affect not only our digital marketing business but our reputation, in general, and our businesses unrelated to digital marketing.\nHealth epidemics could disrupt our business and adversely affect our financial results\nOur contact centers typically seat hundreds of employees in one location. Accordingly, an outbreak of a contagious infection in one or more of the markets in which we do business may result in significant worker absenteeism, lower capacity utilization rates, voluntary or mandatory closure of our delivery centers, travel restrictions on our employees, and other disruptions to our business. Any prolonged or widespread health epidemic could severely disrupt our business operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur credit facility contains covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business or execute on our strategy\nOur credit facility contains common operating and financial covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on how we operate our business and require us to meet certain financial metrics quarterly. Complying with these covenant restrictions may limit our ability to engage in certain activities, including incurring additional indebtedness, making certain investments and capital expenditures, acquisitions, selling certain assets, stock repurchases, payment of existing obligations, or replenishment of cash reserves.\nAs a result of these covenant restrictions, our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and to obtain additional financing, if needed, may be restricted, and we may be prevented from engaging in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us. Our ability to comply with these covenants is dependent on our future performance, which will be subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including prevailing economic conditions. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to meet the financial covenants under our credit facility, or that in the event of noncompliance, will be able to obtain waivers or amendments from the lenders. If we fail to comply with the covenants the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the credit facilities, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable, and there can be no assurance that we would have adequate resources to comply with the accelerated repayment schedule or that the assets securing such indebtedness would be sufficient to repay it in full that indebtedness, which could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition.\nThe volatility of our stock price may result in loss of investment\nOur share price has been and may continue to be subject to substantial fluctuation. We believe that market prices of outsourced customer care management services stock in general have experienced volatility and such volatility will affect our stock price. As we continue to diversify our service offerings to include growth, technology and strategic consulting, our stock price volatility may stabilize or it may be further impacted by stock price fluctuations in these new relevant industries. In addition to fluctuations specific to our industry and service offerings, we believe that various other factors such as general economic conditions, changes or volatility in the financial markets, and changing market condition for our clients could impact the valuation of our stock. The quarterly variations in our financial results, acquisition and divestiture announcements by us or our competitors, strategic partnerships and new service offering, our failure to meet our growth objectives or exceeding our targets, and securities analysts\u2019 perception about our performance could cause the market price of our shares to fluctuate substantially in the future.\nOur Chairman and Chief Executive Officer controls majority of our stock and has control over all matters requiring action by our stockholders\nKenneth D. Tuchman, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, directly and beneficially owns approximately 64.9% of TeleTech\u2019s common stock. As a result, Mr. Tuchman could exercise control over all matters requiring action by our stockholders, including the election of our entire Board of Directors. Therefore, a change in control of our company could not be effected without his approval, even when such a change of control could benefit our other stockholders.", "PERMNO": 83916, "SIC": 7389, "TIC": "TTEC"}
