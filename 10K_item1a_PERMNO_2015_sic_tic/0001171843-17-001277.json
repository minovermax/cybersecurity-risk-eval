RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to other information in this Report, the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our business, because such factors may have a significant impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition, and could cause our stock price to decline. The following sections discuss many, but not all, of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our future performance, but is not intended to be all-inclusive. As a result of the risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this Report, and the risks discussed in our other Securities and Exchange Commission filings, actual future results could differ materially from historical results or those projected in any forward-looking statements.\nRisks related to our growth strategy\nOur quarterly financial results may continue to reflect net losses and may be subject to fluctuations that may cause material variations in our quarterly operating results and make it difficult to forecast future performance.\nBased upon the number of variables within our business, it is subject to execution risk and it may be difficult to project results. As a small business we are subject to increased volatility in our results. Onvia has had a history of net losses and may continue to have losses in the future. Our operating plan considers our ability to execute these initiatives and generate results within a specific timeframe. If we are unable to execute our initiatives as planned, our quarterly financial results may fluctuate and future quarterly results will be affected. A significant portion of our subscription revenue for a particular quarter is derived from transactions that are initiated in previous quarters, because revenue is generally recognized ratably over the subscription term.\nOur current and future levels of operating expenses and capital expenditures are based largely on our growth plans and estimates of future revenue. These expenditure levels are, to a large extent, fixed in the short term. We may not be able to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall, and any significant shortfall in revenue relative to planned expenditures could harm our business and results of operations.\nOur consultative selling approach may not scale the business as planned.\nUnlike a traditional transactional sales process, the consultative selling process used by our sales organization with respect to enterprise clients focuses on fewer, more targeted prospects, which we expect to renew at higher rates with higher contract values than is typically achieved in a transactional sales process. The consultative sales process requires a longer sales cycle than a transactional model and requires the development of a substantial pipeline of qualified prospects to achieve consistent and predictable results. Due to the complexity of a consultative sale, our sales people may not be able to scale their individual results to maximize profitability. As a result of these risks, our business may not scale as planned.\nOur target market of companies with a strategic, long term interest in the public sector may not be adequate to scale our business as planned.\nOur sales effort is largely targeted to companies with a strategic, long term interest in conducting business with the national and regional public sector organized around three high growth industry market sectors: Infrastructure, Information Technology, and Business Services. By focusing on target companies in these industry market sectors, we may not identify qualified prospects in other industry market sectors and we may not have adequate industry knowledge to identify prospects within the targeted market sectors. As a result, our business may not scale as planned.\nOur self-service solution may not scale as planned.\nOur self-service solution gives companies, which primarily do business in three states or less, access a limited subset of our content. This approach may not be competitive with competitor offerings in the space and we may not be able to scale this portion of the business as planned, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur competitors may develop similar technologies that are more broadly accepted in the marketplace.\nThe functionality in Onvia\u2019s products provides business intelligence across industry verticals and geographic regions. If competitors introduce products with similar functionality or are able to more effectively market and price their products for broad client acceptance, new client acquisition and existing client retention would be adversely impacted. If we are unable to enhance functionality or increase marketing efforts to offset challenges from competitors, we may lose market share.\nRapid advances in technology and new mediums for distributing information may diminish the value of our service offerings.\nOur business model is predicated on providing access to and analysis of hard to find public and private sector information. Information in general is quickly becoming more accessible at a low cost as new distribution mediums, such as blogs, and new search technologies are developed. We may be unable to keep up with the rapid advances in information collection, and new technologies and mediums may be developed that commoditize the value of our services. If this were to occur, our revenues would suffer.\nRisks related to our product strategy\nWe may fail to introduce new content and products that are broadly accepted by clients and prospects, and there may be delays in the introduction of these tools and products.\nWe may not adequately identify and capture content that is valuable to new and existing clients. In addition, introducing new content and products is complex and we may not be successful in developing such new offerings on a timely basis, or at all. If client acceptance and adoption of our new products is below our expectations, projected growth rates and client acquisition and retention goals may not be achieved, and financial results would be harmed. We expect to utilize internally developed technology and technology licensed from third parties for the development of new content and products. If we are unable to develop or acquire the required technology on time, or at all, or if the launch of these new products is delayed for any other reason beyond our anticipated launch dates, projected growth rates may not be achieved.\nOnvia Exchange may not be widely used by our Government Clients.\nOur ability to scale Onvia Exchange relies on the voluntary participation of government agencies and their willingness to timely and consistently provide Onvia with agency maintained procurement data that may be normalized and made available to both our government and business clients. In the event that Onvia Exchange is not widely accepted and used by government agencies, our quality and content of government data may be reduced and negatively impact future data solutions.\nWe may be unable to control the cost of ongoing content collection or the cost of collecting new content types to support new product offerings.\nWe will need to identify cost effective sources and develop efficient collection processes for new content types required to support new product development plans. If we are unable to find new ways to collect content efficiently, and aggregate new content types in a cost effective manner, gross margins may decline.\nWe may overestimate the value to our clients of public sector contracting intelligence.\nWe believe there is a large unmet market need for robust public sector contracting information because it is information that is highly fragmented across different levels of agencies. Our business model assumes that clients will continue to pay recurring subscriptions for our content and delivery solutions and we expect increases in the annual value of these contracts as a result of this. If we have overestimated the value of this information, we will not achieve our forecasted revenue goals.\nFinancial, economic and market risks\nUtilization of our net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to annual limitations under the Internal Revenue Code, or may not be usable at all in the future.\nWe have substantial net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) that could be used to offset future tax liabilities arising from future taxable income. In 2011, we conducted a study and determined that an \u201cownership change\u201d occurred in 2001, as defined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (which is generally a greater than a 50 percentage point increase by certain \u201c5% shareholders\u201d over a rolling three-year period). Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the utilization of net deferred tax assets, such as NOLs and other tax attributes, once an ownership change has occurred. The ownership change which occurred in 2001 resulted in a permanent loss of $180.0 million of our U.S. federal NOLs. After this impairment, we had $77.5 million in NOLs as of December 31, 2016 available to offset future taxable net income.\nIt is possible that we could have an additional \u201cownership change\u201d under Section 382 of the Code in the future and lose a significant portion of our net deferred tax assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. As discussed in the following risk factor, we adopted a tax benefits preservation plan in early 2011, which was amended and restated in 2014, to mitigate the risk of future ownership changes.\nWe had approximately $25 million in net deferred tax assets, excluding valuation allowance, as of December 31, 2016. Realization of net deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income, including taxable income in prior carryback years, as well as future taxable income. We regularly review our net deferred tax assets for usability based on a history of earnings, expectations for future earnings and expected timing of reversals of temporary differences. In particular, we consider our three-year earnings trend to determine if we have generated cumulative net income or net losses over that period, which the accounting guidance considers significant evidence to evaluate in determining the existence and amount of any valuation allowance.\nAs a result of our cumulative three-year net loss, it is our best judgment that we should conclude that our net deferred tax assets are not more-likely-than-not to be utilized. Accordingly, we have maintained the valuation allowance as of December 31, 2016 to be 100% of our net deferred tax assets. We may reverse all or a portion of our valuation allowance in the future if it is determined that realization of these benefits is more likely than not.\nWe adopted a tax benefits preservation plan, designed to preserve the value of our net deferred tax assets, primarily related to net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d), which may discourage acquisition and sale of large blocks of our stock and may result in significant dilution for certain stockholders.\nIn April 2014, our Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) approved and adopted a tax benefits preservation plan in the form of the Amended and Restated Section 382 Rights Agreement (the \u201cAmended Rights Agreement\u201d), which amends and restates the previously approved Section 382 Rights Agreement, dated May 4, 2011.\nThe Amended Rights Agreement is designed to preserve stockholder value and the value of certain income tax assets primarily associated with NOLs by acting as a deterrent to any person acquiring beneficial ownership of 4.9% or more of Onvia\u2019s outstanding common stock without the approval of the Board. Ownership changes of greater than 5% could create an ownership change which could limit the realizable value of our NOLs.\nUnder the Amended Rights Agreement, one Preferred Stock Purchase Right (each, a \u201cRight\u201d) was distributed for each share of Common Stock outstanding as of the close of business on May 23, 2011. Pursuant to the Amended Rights Agreement and at the discretion of our Board, if any person or group becomes the beneficial owner (subject to certain restrictions) of 4.9% or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock the Rights may become exercisable. Upon exercise of a Right and payment of the purchase price of $20.00 (the \u201cPurchase Price\u201d), the holder will be entitled to receive a number of shares of Common Stock having a market value equal to two times the Purchase Price.\nThe Amended Rights Agreement may discourage existing 5% stockholders from selling their interest in a single block which may impact the liquidity of Onvia common stock, may deter institutional investors from investing in Onvia stock, and may deter potential acquirers from making premium offers to acquire Onvia, all factors which may depress the market price of our stock or prevent stockholders from receiving a premium in a change in control transaction.\nOur Board has formed an independent Rights Plan Committee to establish a process for evaluating indications of interest from shareholders interested in purchasing more than 4.9% of Onvia stock.\nProvisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may discourage takeover attempts and depress the market price of our stock.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, the state of our incorporation, can have the effect of making it difficult for a third-party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders. These provisions include:\n\u2022 the classification of our Board of Directors into three classes so that the directors serve staggered three-year terms, which may make it difficult for a potential acquirer to gain control of our Board;\n\u2022 authorizing the issuance of shares of undesignated preferred stock without a vote of stockholders; and\n\u2022 non-cumulative voting for the election of directors.\nWe may require additional financial resources which may not be available on favorable terms or at all.\nWe believe that our existing cash and investment balances, and projected cash flow from operations, will be sufficient to fund our plans for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future. However, we may require additional financial resources due to changed business conditions, implementation of our strategy or to pursue future business opportunities requiring investments of additional capital. If our existing financial resources are insufficient to satisfy our requirements, we may seek additional borrowings. Credit market conditions may negatively affect debt availability and cost, and, as a result, financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In addition, the incurrence of indebtedness would result in debt service obligations and could require us to agree to operating and financial covenants that would further restrict our operations.\nPolitical pressure as a result of deficits and budget shortfalls may lead to reduced spending by federal, state and local government agencies.\nShould agencies reduce spending, there may be fewer revenue opportunities to deliver to our clients. Existing clients that leverage our products primarily for new sales leads may perceive a drop in opportunities as a reduction in their return on investment, which could lead to reduced retention rates. In addition, prospects considering an investment in our products may perceive a decline in government spending as a signal that there will be fewer opportunities and they may decide against purchasing a business intelligence solution, or may decide against pursuing public sector opportunities all together, which would negatively impact new client acquisition.\nOperational risks\nWe may not effectively implement new technologies, and new product functionality could fail to perform as designed.\nWe periodically release products that employ new search technologies, ontology categorizations and complex database architecture in new and innovative ways. These technologies are usually built in house, or purchased from third party vendors and reengineered to meet our operational needs. If the creative application of these technologies does not work as planned or if we implement these new technologies poorly or in incompatible ways, our new products and services may not function properly, delivery of our products could be disrupted or delayed and our client retention and new client acquisition may suffer.\nSystem failures could cause an interruption in the services of our network and impact our ability to compile information and deliver our products to clients.\nAny system failure that causes an interruption in the service of our suite of products, disrupts our ability to aggregate, organize and publish new content, or reduces timely access to and delivery of our content could result in client dissatisfaction, which would impact client acquisition and retention rates. Further, prolonged or ongoing performance problems on our web sites or our application servers, which support bid creation and distribution, could damage our reputation and result in the permanent loss of clients.\nWe may not have sufficient business interruption insurance to cover losses from major interruptions. We have deployed our primary business application servers to a secure offsite facility with backup utility power and redundant Internet connectivity. Our current physical cloud based disaster recovery systems are not capable of recovering core business functionality in less than a period of 24 to 48 hours depending on severity in the event of a disaster scenario at the offsite facility. Production, Information Technology and Data department functions will be operational in the event of a local building disaster so that delivery of our products will not be significantly interrupted as long as the offsite facility is still operational. Our disaster recovery plan does not yet include automated failover of product distribution-related systems, requiring extensive manual intervention to complete the recovery process which could result in prolonged service interruptions and ultimately lower client satisfaction.\nOur current technology infrastructure and network software systems may be unable to accommodate our anticipated growth, and we may require a significant investment in these systems to accommodate performance and storage requirements of new and planned products.\nExpansion of the historical content contained in our products and future product offerings to clients have and will place significant additional demands on our enterprise-grade technology infrastructure. We add thousands of records to our database each day, which has required us to expand the storage capacity of the database and client access to this information requires significant computing power based on usage. If new content types, product introductions or workflow processes change current network and computing requirements or if growth in our client base exceeds our expectations, we may be required to make significant investments to upgrade our systems to accommodate such changes, which could negatively impact our cash flows and results of operations. We may not be successful in our efforts to upgrade our systems, or if we do successfully upgrade our systems, we may not do so on time and within budget. Failure to achieve a stable technological platform in time to handle increasing network usage may discourage potential clients from using our network.\nWe may not be able to attract and retain the services of our executive officers, directors, senior managers and other key employees, which could harm our business.\nOur business and operations are substantially dependent on the performance of senior management, directors and key employees. We face competition for the limited pool of these qualified professionals from other companies, some of which have a greater ability to attract and compensate these professionals. Our process for succession planning across all levels of the organization to provide business continuity includes developing, coaching and rewarding high performing employees. The loss and inability to replace any of these employees or directors, including any executive officers, would likely harm our business. In addition, a failure to retain key personnel or hire and train additional qualified personnel as required to support our business, could adversely affect the quality of our products and services, as well as future business and operating results.\nWe could incur substantial costs in the future as a result of cyber incidents.\nAs our dependence on digital technologies to conduct operations increases, so does the risk associated with cyber security. We may be unable to prevent targeted, random or accidental breaches of our security and could incur significant costs associated with lost or stolen information, including increased cyber security protection costs, lost revenues, reputational damage or increased litigation. We may not have sufficient cybersecurity insurance to cover losses from a major incident.\nPolitical, social or environmental conditions in off-shore locations may impact the collection and delivery of our content and/or development of new products.\nPortions of our content are aggregated and/or formatted by off-shore vendors. Delivery of that content may be impacted by local political, social or environmental conditions, which may result in delayed delivery to clients resulting in client dissatisfaction. We also outsource portions of our product development to off-shore vendors. Political, social or environmental conditions in those locations may result in delays of product releases.\nWe may be unable to effectively monitor and prevent unauthorized redistribution of our published information.\nIn the past we have identified a number of entities that have redistributed proprietary information without authorization and against our terms of use. We have been, and will continue to be, aggressive about monitoring and combating such unauthorized use, and are considering technological avenues for blocking such users from our database. However, if we fail to effectively combat such unauthorized use, our business could be harmed.\nOur services and products depend upon the continued availability of licensed technology from third parties, and we may not be able to obtain those licenses on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nWe license, and will continue to license, technology integral to our services and products from third parties. If we are unable to acquire or retain key third-party product licenses or integrate the related third-party products into our network services, our service and product development may be delayed. We also expect to acquire new licenses in the future as our business grows and technology evolves. We may not be able to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nRegulatory, judicial or legislative risks\nIf we are unable to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights our competitive position may be harmed.\nWe rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, confidentiality, non-compete and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, unauthorized third parties may obtain and use technology or other information that we regard as proprietary. Our intellectual property rights may not survive a legal challenge to their validity or provide significant protection for us. The laws of certain countries, particularly in emerging markets, do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Accordingly, we may not be able to protect our intellectual property against unauthorized third-party copying or use, which could adversely affect our competitive position. Additionally, there can be no assurance that another party will not assert that we have infringed its intellectual property rights.\nFuture regulations could be enacted that either directly restrict our business or indirectly impact our business by limiting the growth of e-commerce.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations governing the Internet and e-commerce. These laws and regulations may cover privacy, content, taxation, data protection, copyrights, electronic contracts and other communications, consumer protection, unencumbered Internet access to our services, the design and operations of websites, and the characteristics and quality of products and services. If enacted, unfavorable laws and regulations could limit the market for our services and offerings. Although many regulations might not apply to the business directly, we expect that laws regulating the collection or processing of personal or consumer information could indirectly affect our business. It is possible that legislation could expose companies involved in e-commerce to restrictions or liability, which could limit the growth of e-commerce generally. Legislation could hinder the growth in Internet use and decrease our acceptance as a medium for communication and commerce. If laws were enacted that made our products taxable at the state level, we may be required to pass those additional taxes along to our clients, which would increase the overall cost of our product to our end users and could impact the buying decisions of existing and potential new clients.\nOur access to new content from governmental entities and other third parties may be restricted.\nWe aggregate new information from various public data sources and other third parties and do not have exclusive access to this content. We cannot ensure that these data sources will continue to be available in the future. Moreover, public disclosure laws, which require governmental entities to produce bid information directly to members of the public, may negatively impact our business and reduce the value of our services to clients. The loss or the unavailability of data sources in the future, or the loss of right to distribute some of the data sources, would harm our business.\nOur proprietary content aggregation technology and processes are integral to our success. The content we collect primarily consists of facts related to specific public sector opportunities, transactions, and contacts. Although we endeavor to comply with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to the collection and distribution of our content, it\u2019s possible that our collection and distribution activities may subject us to claims, including breach of contract and intellectual property infringement. We may also be subject to claims that the collection or provision of certain information breached laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security. Even if these claims do not result in liability to us, we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against any claims.\nIf the process of content aggregation becomes regulated in the future and our process for acquiring government bids is no longer cost-effective, our business will be significantly harmed. If new regulations restricting our ability to charge a fee for public bid information are enacted, our business will be significantly harmed.", "PERMNO": 87797, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "ONVI"}
