{"cik": "201461", "company": "CITY NATIONAL CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis report and other reports and statements issued by the Company and its officers from time to time contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. These statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of our management, and on information currently available to our management. Forward-looking statements include information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations, and statements preceded by, followed by, or that include the words \"will,\" \"believes,\" \"expects,\" \"anticipates,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"estimates,\" or similar expressions.\nOur management believes these forward-looking statements are reasonable. However, you should not place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements, since they are based on current expectations. Actual results may differ materially from those currently expected or anticipated. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. By their nature, forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. These statements speak only as of the date they are made. The Company does not undertake to update forward-looking statements to reflect the impact of circumstances or events that arise after the date the forward-looking statements are made\nor to update earnings guidance including the factors that influence earnings. A number of factors, many of which are beyond the Company's ability to control or predict, could cause future results to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements. These factors include, without limitation, the significant factors set forth below.\nFactors That May Affect Future Results\nStockholders of the Corporation who make elections to receive cash, stock or mixed consideration in the Merger may be unable to sell their shares in the market pending the Merger. Stockholders of the Corporation may elect to receive cash, stock or mixed consideration in the Merger by completing an election form that will be provided to stockholders. Elections will require that stockholders making the election turn in their stock certificates representing stock of the Corporation. This means that during the time between when the election is made and the date the Merger is completed, stockholders of the Corporation will be unable to sell their common stock. If the Merger is unexpectedly delayed, this period could extend for a significant period of time. Stockholders of the Corporation can shorten the period during which they cannot sell their shares by delivering their election shortly before the election deadline. However, elections received after the election deadline will not be accepted or honored.\nThe Merger Agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the Merger may not be completed. The Merger Agreement is subject to a number of conditions which must be fulfilled in order to complete the Merger. Those conditions include: (i) approval by stockholders of the Corporation, (ii) receipt of certain regulatory approvals, (iii) the absence of any governmental order or law prohibiting the Merger, (iv) the effectiveness of the registration statement on Form to be filed by Royal Bank of Canada and (v) the authorization for listing of Royal Bank of Canada common shares on the NYSE and the Toronto Stock Exchange and the authorization for listing of Royal Bank of Canada preferred shares on the NYSE. The obligation of each party to consummate the Merger is also conditioned upon (i) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party, (ii) performance in all material respects by the other party of its obligations under the Merger Agreement and (iii) receipt by each party of a tax opinion from their respective counsels. If these conditions to the closing of the Merger are not fulfilled, then the Merger may not be completed. In addition, if the Merger is not completed by January 22, 2016, either Royal Bank of Canada or the Corporation may choose not to proceed with the Merger, and the parties can mutually decide to terminate the Merger Agreement at any time, before or after stockholder approval. In addition, Royal Bank of Canada may elect to terminate the Merger Agreement in certain other circumstances.\nTermination of the Merger Agreement could negatively impact us. If the Merger Agreement is terminated, our business may be adversely impacted by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the Merger. In addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated, the market price of our common stock might decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the Merger will be completed. If the Merger Agreement is terminated and our Board seeks another merger or business combination, stockholders cannot be certain that we will be able to find a party willing to offer equivalent or more attractive consideration than the consideration Royal Bank of Canada has agreed to provide in the Merger. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, we may be required to pay a termination fee of $220 million to Royal Bank of Canada.\nWe will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Merger is pending. Uncertainty about the effect of the Merger on employees and clients may have an adverse effect on us. These uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Merger is completed, and could cause clients and others that deal with us to seek to change their existing business relationships with us. Retention of certain employees may be challenging during\nthe pendency of the Merger, as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles. If key employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty or a desire not to remain with the business, our business could be negatively impacted. In addition, the Merger Agreement restricts us from making certain acquisitions and taking other specified actions without the consent of Royal Bank of Canada until the Merger occurs. These restrictions may prevent us from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the Merger.\nGeneral business and economic conditions may significantly affect our earnings. Our business, earnings and profitability are highly sensitive to general economic, political and industry conditions. These conditions include the yield curve, inflation, available money supply, the value of the United States dollar as compared to foreign currencies, fluctuations in both debt and equity markets, energy and commodity prices and the strength of the United States economy and the local economies in which we conduct business. The United States economy has moderately improved since the financial crisis and unemployment levels have declined, however uncertainty regarding the ability to sustain the pace of economic activity may continue to negatively impact consumers. There can be no assurance that these conditions will continue to improve and these conditions could worsen. The resulting economic pressure on consumers and uncertainty regarding continuing economic improvement may result in further changes in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the level of United States debt may have a destabilizing effect on financial markets. Despite improved financial market conditions, Europe, Asia and other global economies continue to face economic stresses, including lagging growth and significant debt levels, that could impact the capital markets generally, including the trading price of securities, such as our common stock, that do not have substantial direct exposure to foreign economies. A political, economic or financial disruption in the United States or other countries or regions could adversely impact our business by increasing volatility in financial markets generally.\nOur financial performance is highly dependent on the business environment in the States of California and New York, as well as on the economic conditions in the United States generally. The economic conditions in these markets can impact the demand for credit and other banking products and the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal on outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans. Our business can be negatively affected by changes in the financial performance and/or condition of our borrowers, including through decreased loan utilization rates, increased delinquencies and defaults and changes to our clients' ability to meet certain credit obligations. While real estate values have improved, declines in real estate and housing values could have a negative impact on the value of collateral securing loans and could lead to delinquencies and credit quality issues in our residential mortgage and home-equity loan portfolios which could have a negative effect on our results of operations. In addition, negative economic conditions coupled with elevated unemployment and reduced consumer spending could result in higher credit losses in our commercial loan, commercial real estate loan and commercial real estate construction loan portfolios.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act and related legislation regarding the financial services industry may have a significant adverse effect on our operations. The Dodd-Frank Act has had and will continue to have, a broad impact on the financial services industry, imposing significant regulatory and compliance changes, increased capital, leverage and liquidity requirements and numerous other requirements designed to improve supervision and oversight of the financial services sector. The federal agencies tasked with implementing the Dodd-Frank Act have engaged in significant rulemaking but a substantial amount of rulemaking remains to be completed. The federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the rules and regulations, and, as a result, many of the details and much of the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act may not be known for many months or years.\nMany of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, and related legislation and rulemaking, directly affect our business. For example, the implementation of the final Basel III standards significantly modifies the way we measure and manage capital. See Item 1, Business, \"Capital Adequacy and\nPrompt Corrective Action\", above and this Item 1A, Risk Factors, for further discussion. In addition, the Qualified Mortgage and Ability-To-Repay rules could have an impact on our standard underwriting and processing practices and our product offerings going forward, which could result in increased compliance costs. To the extent we fail to comply with applicable rules and regulations or fail to identify practices later deemed to be problematic, we could be subject to litigation, regulatory enforcement, fines and penalties. For example, UDAAP is a wide-ranging regulatory net intended to protect consumers and many areas are subject to intense regulatory scrutiny, from advertising and marketing materials to the order of processing and paying items in a checking account and includes activities by third-party vendors. These and other provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and any rules adopted to implement those provisions as well as any additional legislative or regulatory changes may impact the profitability of our business activities, may require that we change certain of our business practices, may materially affect our business model or affect retention of key personnel, may require us to raise additional regulatory capital and could expose us to additional costs (including increased compliance costs). We may also be required to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes and our ability to conduct our business as previously conducted or our results of operations or financial condition may be adversely affected. See Item 1, Business, \"Supervision and Regulation\" and \"The Dodd-Frank Act\" above for a further discussion of these and other regulatory changes.\nFurther significant changes in banking laws or regulations, the interpretation of those rules and regulations, and changes in federal monetary policy could materially affect our business. In addition to the Dodd-Frank Act discussed above, the banking industry is subject to extensive federal and state regulation. The implementation of new laws or changes in existing laws, including changes in the interpretations of such laws and related rules and regulations by regulators, courts or others, could have a negative impact on our business. Federal and state regulatory agencies also frequently adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied. Parts of our business are also subject to federal and state securities laws and regulations. Significant changes in these laws and regulations could also affect our business. For further discussion of the regulation of financial services, see Item 1, Business, \"Supervision and Regulation.\" We cannot predict the substance or impact of any change in regulation, whether by regulators or as a result of legislation, or in the way such statutory or regulatory requirements are interpreted or enforced. Compliance with such current and potential regulation and scrutiny may significantly increase our costs, impede the efficiency of our internal business practices, require us to increase our regulatory capital and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner.\nOur business is also impacted by federal monetary policy, particularly as implemented through the Federal Reserve System. Federal monetary policy significantly affects our credit conditions, primarily through open market operations in United States government securities, the discount rate for member bank borrowing, and bank reserve requirements. Changes in trade and monetary and fiscal policies and laws, including the interest rate policies of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to stringent capital requirements which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. The Dodd-Frank Act created the FSOC that will recommend to the Federal Reserve increasingly strict rules for capital requirements as companies grow in size and complexity, requires that the OCC seek to make countercyclical its capital requirements for national banks and applies the same leverage and risk-based capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions to most bank holding companies. These requirements, and any other new regulations, could adversely affect our ability to pay dividends, or could require us to reduce business levels or to raise capital, including in ways that may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe are also subject to risk-based capital guidelines implemented by the United States federal bank regulatory agencies based on the 1988 capital accord of the BCBS, referred to as Basel I. In December 2010, the BCBS published the final version of the Capital Accord commonly referred to as Basel III. In 2013, the United States banking regulators approved final rules implementing the regulatory capital and other related requirements under Basel III and the Dodd-Frank Act. The rule replaces the previous regulatory model established under Basel I and will be phased-in over several years with the final increased capital components required to be fully implemented by January 1, 2019.\nBasel III represents both an addition to, and a revision of, the approach of Basel II. Depository institutions subject to the Basel III capital requirements and that do not meet minimum capital requirements, will be subject to prompt corrective action by federal bank regulatory agencies. Prompt corrective action can include progressively more restrictive constraints on operations, management and capital distributions depending on how the institutions' capital levels compare to PCA standards. Stricter capital requirements and capital ratios could adversely affect our ability to pay dividends, or could require us to reduce business levels or to raise capital, including in ways that may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. See Item 1, Business, \"Capital Adequacy and Prompt Corrective Action,\" included elsewhere in this report for further discussion.\nChanges in interest rates affect our profitability. We derive our income mainly from the difference or \"spread\" between the interest we earn on loans, securities, and other interest-earning assets, and interest we pay on deposits, borrowings, and other interest-bearing liabilities. These rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, such as inflation, deflation, recession, and unemployment. In general, the greater this spread, the more we earn. When market rates of interest change, the interest we earn on our assets and the interest we pay on our liabilities fluctuate. This causes our spread to increase or decrease and affects our net interest income. Although we actively manage our asset and liability positions, we will periodically experience \"gaps\" in the interest rate sensitivities of our assets and liabilities, meaning that either our interest-bearing liabilities will be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than our interest-earning assets, or vice versa. In either event, if market interest rates should move contrary to our position, this \"gap\" would work against us, and our earnings may be negatively affected. In addition, interest rates affect how much money we lend, and changes in interest rates may negatively affect deposit growth. Changes in inflation, interest rates and market liquidity may also impact our margins and funding sources.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected if we were to suffer higher than expected losses on our loans due to a slow economy, real estate cycles or other economic events which could require us to increase our allowance for loan and lease losses. We assume credit risk from the possibility that we will suffer losses because borrowers, guarantors, and related parties fail to perform under the terms of their loans. We try to minimize and monitor this risk by adopting and implementing what we believe are effective underwriting and credit policies and procedures, including how we establish and review the allowance for loan and lease losses. We assess the likelihood of nonperformance, track loan performance, and diversify our credit portfolio. Those policies and procedures may not prevent unexpected losses that could adversely affect our results. We continually monitor changes in the economy, particularly housing prices and unemployment rates. There are inherent risks in our lending activities, including flat or volatile interest rates and changes in the economic conditions in the markets in which we operate, including California, New York, Nevada, Tennessee and Georgia. If economic conditions in the United States decline or do not continue to improve, this could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans or the value of collateral securing those loans. If the value of real estate in our markets declines materially, a significant portion of the loan portfolio could become under-collateralized which could have a negative effect on results of operations. We monitor the value of collateral, such as real estate, for loans made by us. Deterioration in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of the\nCompany's control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, \"Loan and Lease Portfolio\" and \"Asset Quality\" located elsewhere in this report for further discussion related to our loan portfolio and our process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for possible loan and lease losses.\nWe may experience further impairments of loans covered under loss-sharing agreements with the FDIC that could negatively impact our earnings. Covered loans consist of acquired loans that are covered under loss-sharing agreements with the FDIC. The Company updates its cash flow projections for covered loans on a quarterly basis. If the expected cash flows decrease due to an anticipated deterioration of performance of covered loans and/or the timing of cash flows and credit losses, a provision expense and an allowance for loan losses could be recognized. To the extent that incorrect assumptions in the value of the covered loans result in greater than anticipated losses in the covered loan portfolio exceeding the losses covered by the loss-sharing agreements with the FDIC, it could have a negative effect on our results of operations.\nDisruptions to our information systems and security breaches could adversely affect our business and reputation. In the ordinary course of business, we rely on electronic communications and information systems to conduct our businesses and to store sensitive data, including financial information regarding our clients. The integrity of information systems are under significant threat from cyber attacks by third parties, including through coordinated attacks sponsored by foreign nations and criminal organizations to disrupt business operations and other compromises to data and systems for political or criminal purposes. We employ an in-depth, layered, defensive approach that leverages people, processes and technology to manage and maintain cyber security controls.\nNotwithstanding the strength of our defensive measures, the threat from cyber attacks is severe, attacks are sophisticated and attackers respond rapidly to changes in defensive measures. Cyber security risks may also occur with our third-party service providers, and may interfere with their ability to fulfill their contractual obligations to us, with attendant potential for financial loss or liability that could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. We offer our clients the ability to bank remotely and provide other technology based products and services, which services include the secure transmission of confidential information over the Internet and other remote channels. To the extent that our client's systems are not secure or are otherwise compromised, our network could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, malicious software, phishing schemes and other security breaches. To the extent that our activities or the activities of our clients or third-party service providers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches and malicious software could expose us to claims, regulatory scrutiny, litigation and other possible liabilities. While to date we have not experienced a significant compromise, significant data loss or material financial losses related to cyber security attacks, our systems and those of our clients and third-party service providers are under constant threat and we may experience a significant event in the future. We may suffer material financial losses related to these risks in the future or we may be subject to liability for compromises to our client or third-party service provider systems. Any such losses or liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations, and could expose us to reputation risk, the loss of client business, increased operational costs, as well as additional regulatory scrutiny, possible litigation, and related financial liability. These risks also include possible business interruption, including the inability to access critical information and systems.\nWe may enter into new lines of business or offer new products and services which expose us to additional risk or which are not successful. We may enter into new lines of business or offer new products or services as new opportunities arise or as our business strategy changes. New lines of business or new products or services may involve significant business, reputational or regulatory risk, including increased regulatory scrutiny. The success of these efforts depends on many factors, including\nthe competitive landscape, market adoption and successful implementation. We may experience significant losses to the extent that we invest significant time and resources to a new line of business, product or service and it is not successful. There can be no assurance that we can successfully manage these risks and failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nA portion of the income generated by our wealth management division and asset management affiliates is subject to market valuation risks. A substantial portion of trust and investment fee income is based on equity, fixed income and other market valuations. As a result, volatility in these markets can positively or negatively impact noninterest income. In addition, because of the low interest rate environment, the off-balance sheet money market funds managed by our wealth management business may be at a greater risk of being moved by our clients to another company or to the Bank's on-balance sheet money market funds. As a result, this may have an unfavorable impact on our earnings.\nWe may experience write-downs of our financial instruments and other losses related to volatile and illiquid market conditions. Market volatility, illiquid market conditions and disruptions in the credit markets could make it difficult to value certain securities in our securities portfolio. Subsequent valuations, in light of factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the values of these securities in future periods. In addition, at the time of any sales and settlements of these securities, the price we ultimately realize will depend on the demand and liquidity in the market at that time and may be materially lower than their current fair value. Any of these factors could require us to take write-downs in the value of our securities portfolio, which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations in future periods.\nBank clients could move their money to alternative investments causing us to lose a lower cost source of funding. Demand deposits can decrease when clients perceive alternative investments, such as those available in our wealth management business, as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. Technology and other changes have made it more convenient for bank clients to transfer funds into alternative investments or other deposit accounts offered by other financial institutions or non-bank service providers. When clients move money out of bank demand deposits and into other investments, we lose a relatively low cost source of funds, increasing our funding costs and reducing our net interest income.\nIncreased competition from financial services companies and other companies that offer banking and wealth management services could negatively impact our business. We operate in a highly competitive environment and increased competition in our markets may result in downward pressure on pricing, lower loan levels, a reduction in deposits and/or assets under management, increased costs and may limit our ability to increase market share. Many competitors offer the banking services and wealth management services that we offer in our service area. These competitors, both domestic and foreign, include national, regional, and community banks. A substantial and permanent loss of either client accounts or assets under management at our wealth management affiliates or our wealth management division could have a negative impact on our results of operations. We also face intense competition from many other types of financial institutions, including, without limitation, savings and loans, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, credit unions, private equity funds, mortgage banks, and other financial intermediaries. Banks, trust companies, investment advisors, mutual fund companies, multi-family offices and insurance companies compete with us for trust and asset management business. In addition, technological advances and the growth of e-commerce have made it possible for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that were traditionally offered only by banks.\nWe also face intense competition for talent. Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to hire and retain key people. Competition for the best people in most businesses in which we engage can\nbe intense. If we are unable to attract, retain and motivate talented people, our business could suffer. The Dodd-Frank Act includes mandates requiring the Federal Reserve to establish compensation guidelines covering regulated financial institutions. Restrictions on executive compensation could have an adverse effect on our ability to hire or retain our talent.\nOur controls and procedures could fail or be circumvented. Management regularly reviews and updates our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurances of the effectiveness of these systems and controls, and that the objectives of these controls have been met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures, and any failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in accounting standards or tax legislation could have a negative impact on our business. Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. From time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements or elected representatives approve changes to tax laws that could affect our corporate taxes. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations.\nBusinesses we acquire may not perform as expected which could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations. We have in the past and may in the future seek to grow our business by acquiring other businesses. We cannot predict the frequency, size or timing of our acquisitions, and we typically do not comment publicly on a possible acquisition until we have signed a definitive agreement. There can be no assurance that our acquisitions will have the anticipated positive results, including results related to: the total cost of integration; the time required to complete the integration; the amount of longer-term cost savings; continued growth; or the overall performance of the acquired company or combined entity. Integration of an acquired business can be complex and costly. If the businesses we acquire do not perform as expected or we are not able to integrate successfully past or future acquisitions, there is a risk that results of operations could be adversely affected. We also expand our operations through de novo branching efforts. If our de novo branching efforts are not successful in driving new business, it could increase our operation costs and have a negative impact on our business.\nImpairment of goodwill or intangible assets associated with acquisitions would result in a charge to earnings. Goodwill and intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. We may be required to record a charge to earnings during the period in which any impairment of goodwill or intangibles is determined.\nOur business and financial results could be impacted materially by adverse results in legal proceedings and governmental investigations and inquiries. Aspects of our business involve risk of legal liability. We have been named or threatened to be named as defendants in various legal proceedings arising from our business activities. In addition, we may be the subject of governmental investigations and other forms of regulatory inquiry from time to time. The results of these legal proceedings and governmental investigations and inquiries could lead to significant monetary damages or penalties, restrictions on the way in which we conduct our business, reputational harm and loss of client business.\nAlthough we establish accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount\nof loss can be reasonably estimated, we do not have accruals for all legal proceedings where we face a risk of loss. In addition, amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to us from the legal proceedings in question. Thus, our ultimate losses may be higher or lower, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies.\nOur business and financial performance could be adversely affected, directly or indirectly, by disasters, by terrorist activities or by international hostilities. Neither the occurrence nor the potential impact of disasters, terrorist activities and international hostilities can be predicted. However, these occurrences could impact us directly as a result of damage to our facilities or by preventing us from conducting our business in the ordinary course, or indirectly as a result of their impact on our borrowers, the value of collateral, depositors, other clients, suppliers or other counterparties. We could also suffer adverse consequences to the extent that disasters, terrorist activities or international hostilities affect the financial markets or the economy in general or in any particular region. For example, a significant earthquake could impact us directly by disrupting our business operations or could lead to an increase in delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults that could result in our experiencing higher levels of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and provisions for credit losses.\nOur ability to mitigate the adverse consequences of such occurrences is in part dependent on the quality of our resiliency planning, and our ability, if any, to anticipate the nature of any such event that occurs. The adverse impact of disasters or terrorist activities or international hostilities also could be increased to the extent that there is a lack of preparedness on the part of national or regional emergency responders or on the part of other organizations and businesses that we deal with, particularly those that we depend upon but have no control over.\nNegative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely affect our earnings. Reputational risk, or the risk to our earnings and capital from negative public opinion, is inherent in our business. Negative public opinion can result from the actual or perceived manner in which we conduct our business activities, including activities in our private and business banking operations, wealth management and investment and trust operations; our management of actual or potential conflicts of interest and ethical issues; and our protection of confidential client information. Our brand and reputation may also be harmed by actions taken by third parties that we contract with to provide services to the extent such parties fail to meet their contractual, legal and regulatory obligations or act in a manner that is harmful to our clients. If we fail to supervise these relationships effectively, we could also be subject to regulatory enforcement, including fines and penalties. Negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to keep and attract clients and can expose us to litigation and regulatory action. We take steps to minimize reputation risk in the way we conduct our business activities and deal with our clients, communities and vendors but our efforts may not be sufficient.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due us. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 23916, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "CYN"}
