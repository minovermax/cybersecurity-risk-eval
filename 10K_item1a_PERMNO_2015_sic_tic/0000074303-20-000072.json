{"cik": "74303", "company": "OLIN Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information in this Form 10-K, the following factors should be considered in evaluating Olin and our business. All of our forward-looking statements should be considered in light of these factors. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently deem immaterial also may become important factors that affect us.\nSensitivity to Global Economic Conditions and Cyclicality-Our operating results could be negatively affected during economic and industry downturns.\nThe businesses of most of our customers, particularly our vinyls, urethanes and pulp and paper customers are, to varying degrees, cyclical and have historically experienced periodic downturns. These economic and industry downturns have been characterized by diminished product demand, excess manufacturing capacity and, in some cases, lower average selling prices. Therefore, any significant downturn in our customers\u2019 businesses or in global economic conditions could result in a reduction in demand for our products and could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nAlthough a majority of our sales are within North America, a large part of our financial performance is dependent upon a healthy economy beyond North America because we have a significant amount of sales abroad and our customers sell their products abroad. As a result, our business is and will continue to be affected by general economic conditions and other factors in Europe, Asia Pacific, particularly China, and Latin America, including fluctuations in interest rates, customer demand, labor and energy costs, currency changes and other factors beyond our control, such as public health epidemics. The demand for our products and our customers\u2019 products is directly affected by such fluctuations. In addition, our customers could decide to move some or all of their production to locations that are more remote from our facilities, and this could reduce demand for our products. We cannot assure you that events having an adverse effect on the industries in which we operate will not occur or continue, such as a downturn in the European, Asian Pacific, particularly Chinese, Latin American, or world economies, increases in interest rates or unfavorable currency fluctuations. Economic conditions in other regions of the world, predominantly Asia and Europe, can increase the amount of caustic soda produced and available for export to North America. The increased caustic soda supply can put downward pressure on our caustic soda prices, negatively impacting our profitability.\nCyclical Pricing Pressure-Our profitability could be reduced by declines in average selling prices of our products, particularly chlorine and caustic soda.\nOur historical operating results reflect the cyclical and sometimes volatile nature of the chemical and ammunition industries. We experience cycles of fluctuating supply and demand in each of our business segments, particularly in our Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment, which result in changes in selling prices. Periods of high demand, tight supply and increasing operating margins tend to result in increases in capacity and production until supply exceeds demand, generally followed by periods of oversupply and declining prices. Another factor influencing demand and pricing for chlorine and caustic soda is the price of natural gas. Higher natural gas prices increase our customers\u2019 and competitors\u2019 manufacturing costs, and depending on the ratio of crude oil to natural gas prices, could make them less competitive in world markets.\nIn the chlor alkali industry, price is the major supplier selection criterion. We have little or no ability to influence prices in these large commodity markets. Decreases in the average selling prices of our products could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. While we strive to maintain or increase our profitability by reducing costs through improving production efficiency, emphasizing higher margin products and by controlling transportation, selling and administration expenses, we cannot assure you that these efforts will be sufficient to fully offset the effect of possible decreases in pricing on operating results.\nBecause of the cyclical nature of our businesses, we cannot assure you that pricing or profitability in the future will be comparable to any particular historical period, including the most recent period shown in our operating results. We cannot assure you that the chlor alkali industry will not experience adverse trends in the future, or that our business, financial condition and results of operations will not be adversely affected by them.\nOur Winchester and Epoxy segments are also subject to changes in operating results as a result of cyclical pricing pressures, but to a lesser extent than our Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls segment. Selling prices of ammunition and epoxy materials are affected by changes in raw material costs and availability, customer demand, industry production capacity and declines in average selling prices of products of our Winchester and Epoxy segments could adversely affect our profitability.\nSuppliers-We rely on a limited number of third-party suppliers for specified feedstocks and services.\nWe obtain a significant portion of our raw materials from a few key suppliers. If any of these suppliers fail to meet their obligations under present or any future supply agreements, we may be forced to pay higher prices or incur higher costs to obtain the necessary raw materials. Any interruption of supply or any price increase of raw materials could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have entered into long-term agreements with Dow to provide specified feedstocks and services for a number of our facilities. These facilities are dependent upon Dow\u2019s infrastructure for services such as wastewater and ground water treatment. Any failure of Dow to perform its obligations under those agreements could adversely affect the operation of the affected facilities and our business, financial condition and results of operations. Most of these agreements are automatically renewable after their initial terms, but may be terminated by us or Dow after specified notice periods. If we are required to obtain an alternate source for these feedstocks or services, we may not be able to obtain pricing on as favorable terms. Additionally, we may be forced to pay additional transportation costs or to invest in capital projects for pipelines or alternate facilities to accommodate railcar or other delivery methods or to replace other services.\nA vendor may choose, subject to existing contracts, to modify its relationship due to general economic concerns or concerns relating to the vendor or us, at any time. Any significant change in the terms that we have with our key suppliers could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, as could significant additional requirements from suppliers that we provide them additional security in the form of prepayments or posting letters of credit.\nRaw Materials-Availability of purchased feedstocks and energy, and the volatility of these costs, impact our operating costs and add variability to earnings.\nPurchased feedstock and energy costs account for a substantial portion of our total production costs and operating expenses. We purchase certain raw materials as feedstocks.\nFeedstock and energy costs generally follow price trends in crude oil and natural gas, which are sometimes volatile. Ultimately, the ability to pass on underlying cost increases in a timely manner or at all is dependent on market conditions. Conversely, when feedstock and energy costs decline, selling prices generally decline as well. As a result, volatility in these costs could impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the availability of any of our principal feedstocks is limited or we are unable to obtain natural gas or energy from any of our energy sources, we may be unable to produce some of our products in the quantities demanded by our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on plant utilization and our sales of products requiring such raw materials. We have long-term supply contracts with various third parties for certain raw materials, including ethylene, electricity, propylene and benzene. As these contracts expire, we may be unable to renew these contracts or obtain new long-term supply agreements on terms comparable or as favorable to us, depending on market conditions, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, many of our long-term contracts contain provisions that allow our suppliers to limit the amount of raw materials shipped to us below the contracted amount in force majeure or similar circumstances. If we are required to obtain alternate sources for raw materials because our suppliers are unwilling or unable to perform under raw material supply agreements or if a supplier terminates its agreements with us, we may not be able to obtain these raw materials from alternative suppliers or obtain new long-term supply agreements on terms comparable or as favorable to us.\nCost Control-Our profitability could be reduced if we experience increasing raw material, utility, transportation or logistics costs, or if we fail to achieve targeted cost reductions.\nOur operating results and profitability are dependent upon our continued ability to control, and in some cases reduce, our costs. If we are unable to do so, or if costs outside of our control, particularly our costs of raw materials, utilities, transportation and similar costs, increase beyond anticipated levels, our profitability will decline.\nFor example, if our feedstock and energy costs increase, and we are unable to control those costs or pass the increased costs on to customers, our profitability in our Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls and Epoxy segments would be negatively affected. Similarly, costs of commodity metals and other materials used in our Winchester business, such as copper and lead, can vary. If we experience significant increases in these costs and are unable to raise our prices to offset the higher costs, the profitability in our Winchester business would be negatively affected.\nThird-Party Transportation-We rely heavily on third-party transportation, which subjects us to risks and costs that we cannot control, and which risks and costs may have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.\nWe rely heavily on railroad, truck, marine vessel, barge and other shipping companies to transport finished products to customers and to transport raw materials to the manufacturing facilities used by each of our businesses. These transport operations are subject to various hazards and risks, including extreme weather conditions, work stoppages and operating hazards, as well as domestic and international transportation and maritime regulations. In addition, the methods of transportation we utilize, including shipping chlorine and other chemicals by railroad and by barge, may be subject to additional, more stringent and more costly regulations in the future. If we are delayed or unable to ship finished products or unable to obtain raw materials as a result of any such new or modified regulations or public policy changes related to transportation safety, or these transportation companies\u2019 failure to operate properly, or if there are significant changes in the cost of these services due to new additional regulations, or otherwise, we may not be able to arrange efficient alternatives and timely means to obtain raw materials or ship goods, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations. If any third-party railroad that we utilize to transport chlorine and other chemicals ceases to transport certain hazardous materials, or if there are significant changes in the cost of shipping hazardous materials by rail or otherwise, we may not be able to arrange efficient alternatives and timely means to deliver our products or at all, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations.\nSecurity and Chemicals Transportation-New regulations on the transportation of hazardous chemicals and/or the security of chemical manufacturing facilities and public policy changes related to transportation safety could result in significantly higher operating costs.\nThe transportation of our products and feedstocks, including transportation by pipeline, and the security of our chemical manufacturing facilities are subject to extensive regulation. Government authorities at the local, state and federal levels could implement new or stricter regulations that would impact the security of chemical plant locations and the transportation of hazardous chemicals. Our Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls and Epoxy segments could be adversely impacted by the cost of complying with any new regulations. Our business also could be adversely affected if an incident were to occur at one of our facilities or while transporting products. The extent of the impact would depend on the requirements of future regulations and the nature of an incident, which are unknown at this time.\nProduction Hazards-Our facilities are subject to operating hazards, which may disrupt our business.\nWe are dependent upon the continued safe and reliable operation of our production facilities. Our production facilities are subject to hazards associated with the manufacture, handling, storage and transportation of chemical materials and products and ammunition, including leaks and ruptures, explosions, fires, inclement weather and natural disasters, unexpected utility disruptions or outages, unscheduled downtime, equipment failure, terrorism, transportation interruptions, transportation accidents involving our chemical products, chemical spills and other discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and environmental hazards. Due to the integrated nature of our large chemical sites, an incident at one plant could impact production across multiple plants at a facility. From time to time in the past, we have had incidents that have temporarily shut down or otherwise disrupted our manufacturing, causing production delays and resulting in liability for workplace injuries and fatalities. Some of our products involve the manufacture and/or handling of a variety of explosive and flammable materials. Use of these products by our customers could also result in liability if an explosion, fire, spill or other accident were to occur. We cannot assure you that we will not experience these types of incidents in the future or that these incidents will not result in production delays or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Major hurricanes have caused significant disruption in our operations on the U.S. Gulf Coast, logistics across the region and the supply of certain raw materials, which have had an adverse impact on volume and cost for some of our products. Due to the substantial presence we have on the U.S. Gulf Coast, similar severe weather conditions or other natural phenomena in the future could negatively affect our results of operations, for which we may not be fully insured.\nCredit Facility-Weak industry conditions could affect our ability to comply with the financial maintenance covenants in our senior credit facility.\nOur senior credit facility includes certain financial maintenance covenants requiring us to not exceed a maximum leverage ratio and to maintain a minimum coverage ratio.\nDepending on the magnitude and duration of economic or industry downturns affecting our businesses, including deterioration in prices and volumes, there can be no assurance that we will continue to be in compliance with these ratios. If we failed to comply with either of these covenants in a future period and were not able to obtain waivers from the lenders, we would need to refinance our current senior credit facility. However, there can be no assurance that such refinancing would be available to us on terms that would be acceptable to us or at all.\nInformation Security-A failure of our information technology systems, or an interruption in their operation due to internal or external factors including cyber-attacks, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur operations are dependent on our ability to protect our information systems, computer equipment and information databases from systems failures. We rely on both internal information technology systems and certain external services and service providers to manage the day-to-day operation of our business, operate elements of our manufacturing facilities, manage relationships with our employees, customers and suppliers, fulfill customer orders and maintain our financial and accounting records. Failure of any one or more than one of our information technology systems could be caused by internal or external events, such as incursions by intruders or hackers, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, failures in hardware or software, or power or telecommunication fluctuations or failures. The failure of our information technology systems to perform as anticipated for any reason or any significant breach of security could disrupt our business and result in numerous adverse consequences, including reduced effectiveness and efficiency of operations, increased costs or loss of important information, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We have technology and information security processes, periodic external service and service provider reviews, insurance policies and disaster recovery plans in place to mitigate our risk to these vulnerabilities. However, these measures may not be adequate to ensure that our operations will not be disrupted or our financial impact minimalized, should such an event occur.\nIntegration of Information Technology Systems-Operation on multiple Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) information systems, and the conversion to a new system, may negatively impact our operations.\nWe are highly dependent on our information systems infrastructure in order to process orders, track inventory, ship products in a timely manner, prepare invoices to our customers, make payments to our suppliers, maintain regulatory compliance and otherwise carry on our business in the ordinary course. We currently operate on multiple ERP information systems. Since we are required to process and reconcile our information from multiple systems, the chance of errors is greater. Inconsistencies in the information from multiple ERP systems could adversely impact our ability to manage our business efficiently and may result in heightened risk to our ability to maintain our books and records and comply with regulatory requirements. In 2017, we began a multi-year implementation of new enterprise resource planning, manufacturing, and engineering systems. The project includes the required information technology infrastructure (collectively, the Information Technology Project). The project is planned to standardize business processes across the chemicals businesses with the objective of maximizing cost effectiveness, efficiency and control across our global operations. At the end of 2019, Olin had successfully converted approximately 35% of our chemical business users to the new enterprise resource planning systems. The project is anticipated to be substantially completed during 2020. The transition to a new ERP system involves numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention away from normal daily business operations;\n\u2022\nloss of, or delays in accessing, data;\n\u2022\nincreased demand on our operations support personnel;\n\u2022\nincreased costs;\n\u2022\ninitial dependence on unfamiliar systems while training personnel to use new systems; and\n\u2022\nincreased operating expenses resulting from training, conversion and transition support activities.\nAny of the foregoing could result in a material increase in information technology compliance or other related costs, and could materially and negatively impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nImbalance in Demand for Our Chlor Alkali Products-A loss of a substantial customer for either our chlorine or caustic soda could cause an imbalance in customer demand for these products, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nChlorine and caustic soda are produced simultaneously and in a fixed ratio of 1.0 ton of chlorine to 1.1 tons of caustic soda. The loss of a substantial chlorine or caustic soda customer could cause an imbalance in customer demand for either our chlorine and caustic soda products. An imbalance in customer demand may require Olin to reduce production of both chlorine and caustic soda or take other steps to correct the imbalance. Since Olin cannot store large quantities of chlorine, we may not be able to respond to an imbalance in customer demand for these products quickly or efficiently. If a substantial imbalance occurred, we would need to reduce prices or take other actions that could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIndebtedness-Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $3,340.8 million of indebtedness outstanding. Outstanding indebtedness does not include amounts that could be borrowed under our $800.0 million senior revolving credit facility, under which $796.5 million was available for borrowing as of December 31, 2019 because we had issued $3.5 million of letters of credit. As of December 31, 2019, our indebtedness represented 58.0% of our total capitalization. At December 31, 2019, $2.1 million of our indebtedness was due within one year. Despite our level of indebtedness, we expect to continue to have the ability to borrow additional debt.\nOur indebtedness could have important consequences, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures, and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to accommodate growth by reducing funds otherwise available for other corporate purposes and to compete, which in turn could prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nlimiting our operational flexibility due to the covenants contained in our debt agreements;\n\u2022\nto the extent that our debt is subject to floating interest rates, increasing our vulnerability to fluctuations in market interest rates;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to pay cash dividends;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility for, or reacting to, changes in our business or industry or economic conditions, thereby limiting our ability to compete with companies that are not as highly leveraged; and\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to economic downturns.\nOur ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt will depend on a range of economic, competitive and business factors, many of which are outside our control. There can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make these payments. If we are unable to meet our expenses and debt obligations, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness before maturity, sell assets or issue additional equity. We may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness, sell assets or issue additional equity on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our debt obligations on commercially reasonable terms, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as on our ability to satisfy our debt obligations.\nLitigation and Claims-We are subject to litigation and other claims, which could cause us to incur significant expenses.\nWe are regularly a defendant in legal proceedings relating to our present and former operations. These include contract disputes, product liability claims, including ammunition and firearms, and proceedings alleging injurious exposure of plaintiffs to various chemicals and other substances (including proceedings based on alleged exposures to asbestos). Frequently, the proceedings alleging injurious exposure involve claims made by numerous plaintiffs against many defendants. Because of the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we are unable to predict the outcome of these proceedings and therefore cannot determine whether the financial impact, if any, will be material to our financial position, cash flows or results of operations.\nEffects of Regulation-Changes in or failure to comply with legislation or government regulations or policies could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.\nLegislation or regulations that may be adopted or modified by U.S. or foreign governments, including legislation or regulations intended to address climate change, import and export duties and quotas, anti-dumping measures and related tariffs, and tax regulation could significantly affect the sales, costs and profitability of our business. The chemical and ammunition industries are subject to legislative and regulatory actions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations. Existing and future government regulations and laws may reduce the demand for our products or impact our ability to use or manufacture certain products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. A material change in tax laws, treaties or regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate or a change in their interpretation or application could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEnvironmental Costs-We have ongoing environmental costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.\nOur operations and assets are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety regulations, including laws and regulations related to air emissions, water discharges, waste disposal and remediation of contaminated sites. The nature of our operations and products, including the raw materials we handle, exposes us to the risk of liabilities, obligations or claims under these laws and regulations due to the production, storage, use, transportation and sale of materials that can adversely impact the environment or cause personal injury, including, in the case of chemicals, unintentional releases into the environment. Environmental laws may have a significant effect on the costs of use, transportation, handling and storage of raw materials and finished products, as well as the costs of storage, handling, treatment, transportation and disposal of wastes. In addition, we are party to various government and private environmental actions associated with past manufacturing facilities and former waste disposal sites. We have incurred, and expect to incur, significant costs and capital expenditures in complying with environmental laws and regulations.\nThe ultimate costs and timing of environmental liabilities are difficult to predict. Liabilities under environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can be imposed retroactively and on a joint and several basis. One liable party could be held responsible for all costs at a site, regardless of fault, percentage of contribution to the site or the legality of the original disposal. We could incur significant costs, including clean-up costs, natural resource damages, civil or criminal fines and sanctions and\nthird-party lawsuits claiming, for example, personal injury and/or property damage, as a result of past or future violations of, or liabilities under, environmental or other laws.\nIn addition, future events, such as changes to or more rigorous enforcement of environmental laws or new information about the extent of remediation required, could require us to make additional expenditures, modify or curtail our operations and/or install additional pollution control equipment. It is possible that regulatory agencies may identify new chemicals of concern or enact new or more stringent clean-up standards for existing chemicals of concern. This could lead to expenditures for environmental remediation in the future that are additional to existing estimates.\nAccordingly, it is possible that some of the matters in which we are involved or may become involved may be resolved unfavorably to us, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, cash flows or results of operations. See \u201cEnvironmental Matters\u201d contained in Item 7 - \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d\nAbility to Attract and Retain Qualified Employees-We must attract, retain and motivate key employees, and the failure to do so may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe feel our success depends on hiring, retaining and motivating key employees, including executive officers. We may have difficulty locating and hiring qualified personnel. In addition, we may have difficulty retaining such personnel once hired, and key people may leave and compete against us. The loss of key personnel or our failure to attract and retain other qualified and experienced personnel could disrupt or materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, our operating results could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for employees or higher employee turnover, which may result in the loss of significant customer business or increased costs.\nPension Plans-The impact of declines in global equity and fixed income markets on asset values and any declines in interest rates and/or improvements in mortality assumptions used to value the liabilities in our pension plans may result in higher pension costs and the need to fund the pension plans in future years in material amounts.\nWe sponsor domestic and foreign defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees. Substantially all domestic defined benefit pension plan participants are no longer accruing benefits. However, a portion of our bargaining hourly employees continue to participate in our domestic qualified defined benefit pension plans under a flat-benefit formula. Our funding policy for the qualified defined benefit pension plans is consistent with the requirements of federal laws and regulations. Our foreign subsidiaries maintain pension and other benefit plans, which are consistent with local statutory practices. The determinations of pension expense and pension funding are based on a variety of rules and regulations. Changes in these rules and regulations could impact the calculation of pension plan liabilities and the valuation of pension plan assets. They may also result in higher pension costs, additional financial statement disclosure, and the need to fund the pension plan.\nAt December 31, 2019, the projected benefit obligation of $2,992.0 million exceeded the market value of assets in our qualified defined benefit pension plans by $792.7 million, as calculated under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 715 \u201cCompensation-Retirement Benefits\u201d (ASC 715). During 2019, we made a discretionary cash contribution to our domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan of $12.5 million. Based on our plan assumptions and estimates, we will not be required to make any cash contributions to the domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan at least through 2020.\nWe have international qualified defined benefit pension plans to which we made cash contributions of $2.4 million, $2.6 million and $1.7 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and we anticipate less than $5 million of cash contributions to international qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2020.\nThe impact of declines in global equity and fixed income markets on asset values may result in higher pension costs and may increase and accelerate the need to fund the pension plans in future years. For example, holding all other assumptions constant, a 100-basis point decrease or increase in the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets for our domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan would have decreased or increased, respectively, the 2019 defined benefit pension plan income by approximately $19.8 million. Holding all other assumptions constant for our domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan, a 50-basis point decrease in the discount rate used to calculate pension income for 2019 and the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2019 would have decreased pension income by $0.4 million and increased the projected benefit obligation by $160.0 million. A 50-basis point increase in the discount rate used to calculate pension income for 2019 and the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2019 for our domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan would have increased pension income by $0.6 million and decreased the projected benefit obligation by $145.0 million.\nInternational Sales and Operations-We are subject to risks associated with our international sales and operations that could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nOlin has an international presence, including the geographic regions of Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America. In 2019, approximately 41% of our sales were generated outside of the United States. These international sales and operations expose us to risks, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties and costs associated with complying with complex and varied laws, treaties, and regulations;\n\u2022\ntariffs and trade barriers;\n\u2022\noutbreaks of pandemic disease, such as coronavirus, which could cause us and our suppliers and/or customers to temporarily suspend operations in affected areas, restrict the ability of Olin to distribute our products or cause economic downturns that could affect demand for our products;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and regulations, including the imposition of economic or trade sanctions affecting international commercial transactions;\n\u2022\nrisk of non-compliance with anti-bribery laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on, or difficulties and costs associated with, the repatriation of cash from foreign countries to the United States;\n\u2022\nunfavorable currency fluctuations;\n\u2022\nchanges in local economic conditions;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in political or regulatory environments;\n\u2022\nlabor compliance and costs associated with a global workforce;\n\u2022\ndata privacy regulations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in maintaining overseas subsidiaries and international operations; and\n\u2022\nchallenges in protecting intellectual property rights.\nAny one or more of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAsset Impairment-If our goodwill, other intangible assets or property, plant and equipment become impaired in the future, we may be required to record non-cash charges to earnings, which could be significant.\nThe process of impairment testing for our goodwill involves a number of judgments and estimates made by management including future cash flows, discount rates, profitability assumptions and terminal growth rates with regards to our reporting units. Our internally generated long-range plan includes cyclical assumptions regarding pricing and operating forecasts for the chlor alkali industry. If the judgments and estimates used in our analysis are not realized or are affected by external factors, then actual results may not be consistent with these judgments and estimates, and we may be required to record a goodwill impairment charge in the future, which could be significant and have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe review long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and identifiable amortizing intangible assets, for impairment whenever changes in circumstances or events may indicate that the carrying amounts are not recoverable. If the fair value is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment is recognized for the difference. Factors which may cause an impairment of long-lived assets include significant changes in the manner of use of these assets, negative industry or market trends, a significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, extended period of idleness or a likely sale or disposal of the asset before the end of its estimated useful life. If our property, plant and equipment and identifiable amortizing intangible assets are determined to be impaired in the future, we may be required to record non-cash charges to earnings during the period in which the impairment is determined, which could be significant and have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nCredit and Capital Market Conditions-Adverse conditions in the credit and capital markets may limit or prevent our ability to borrow or raise capital.\nWhile we believe we have facilities in place that should allow us to borrow funds as needed to meet our ordinary course business activities, adverse conditions in the credit and financial markets could prevent us from obtaining financing, if the need arises. Our ability to invest in our businesses and refinance or repay maturing debt obligations could require access to the credit and capital markets and sufficient bank credit lines to support cash requirements. If we are unable to access the credit and capital markets on commercially reasonable terms, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations.\nLake City Plant Contract-Various risks associated with our transition and subsequent operation of the Lake City Army Ammunition Plant could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn 2019, our Winchester business was selected by the United States Army to operate and manage the Lake City Army Ammunition Plant in Independence, MO. Our bid for this contract was developed using assumptions about the operating conditions of the facility and the future demand of ammunition produced from that facility. These assumptions were based upon our knowledge of the facility and the market at the time of the bid as well as information that was provided to us by the United States Army during the solicitation process. If our assumptions were incorrect, we may experience additional costs or lower revenues than expected as a result of this contract.\nThe Lake City Plant contract is a fixed-price contract under which we have limited ability to pass along cost overruns.\nBeginning on October 1, 2019 and continuing until October 1, 2020, we are working with the incumbent contractor at the Lake City Plant to transition the plant to our management and control. We have developed a transition plan that involves transition of the workforce, negotiation of new labor contracts, implementation of information technology and operating systems and start-up of manufacturing processes. If we do not meet our timelines or otherwise fail to complete portions of our transition plan, we may incur additional costs or fail to meet the anticipated financial results associated with this contract.\nLabor Matters-We cannot assure that we can conclude future labor contracts or any other labor agreements without work stoppages.\nVarious labor unions represent a significant number of our hourly paid employees for collective bargaining purposes. The following labor contract will be required to be negotiated in 2020:\nWhile we believe our relations with our employees and their various representatives are generally satisfactory, we cannot assure that we can conclude any labor agreements without work stoppages and cannot assure that any work stoppages will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.", "PERMNO": 13610, "SIC": 2810, "TIC": "OLN"}
