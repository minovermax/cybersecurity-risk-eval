This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The statements contained in this communication that are not purely historical are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements give the Company\u2019s current expectations or forecasts of future events. These forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of words such as \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201cforecast,\u201d \u201cfuture,\u201d \u201cgoal,\u201d \u201cguidance,\u201d \u201chope,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201cpoised,\u201d \u201cpredict,\u201d \u201cproject,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cstrategy,\u201d \u201ctarget,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d and variations of such words and similar expressions. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that are often difficult to predict and beyond the Company\u2019s control, and could\ncause the Company\u2019s results to differ materially from those described. These risks and uncertainties include, without limitation: changes in general industry or regional market conditions; changes in consumer and customer preferences for our products (such as cameras replacing mirrors and/or autonomous driving); our ability to be awarded new business; continued uncertainty in pricing negotiations with customers; loss of business from increased competition; changes in strategic relationships; customer bankruptcies or divestiture of customer brands; fluctuation in vehicle production schedules (including the impact of customer employee strikes); changes in product mix; raw material and other supply shortages; supply chain disruptions; our dependence on key management; our dependence on information systems; higher raw material, fuel, energy and other costs; unfavorable fluctuations in currencies or interest rates in the regions in which we operate; costs or difficulties related to the integration and/or ability to maximize the value of any new or acquired technologies and businesses; changes in regulatory conditions; warranty and recall claims and other litigation and customer reactions thereto; possible adverse results of pending or future litigation or infringement claims; changes in tax laws; import and export duty and tariff rates in or with the countries with which we conduct business; negative impact of any governmental investigations and associated litigation including securities litigation relating to the conduct of our business; the length and severity of the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic, including its impact across our business on demand, operations, and the global supply chain. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made.\nThe Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law or the rules of the NASDAQ Global Select Market. Accordingly, any forward-looking statement should be read in conjunction with the additional information about risks and uncertainties identified under the heading \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in the Company\u2019s latest Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filed with the\u202fSEC, which risks and uncertainties now include the impacts of COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic that has affected, and will continue to affect, general economic and industry conditions, customers, suppliers, and the regulatory environment in which the Company operates. Includes content supplied by IHS Markit Light Vehicle Production Forecast of January 18, 2021 (http://www.gentex.com/forecast-disclaimer).\nThe following risk factors, together with all other information provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered.\nAutomotive Industry. Customers within the auto industry comprise approximately 98% of our net sales. The automotive industry has always been cyclical and highly impacted by levels of economic activity. The current economic environment continues to be uncertain, and continues to cause increased financial and production stresses evidenced by volatile automotive production levels (including continued decreases in light vehicle production in China), volatility with customer orders, supplier part and material shortages, automotive and Tier 1 supplier plant shutdowns, customer and supplier financial issues, commodity material cost increases and/or supply constraints, tariffs, consumer vehicle preference shifts (where we may have a lower penetration rate and lower content per vehicle), and supply chain stresses, all of which have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. If automotive customers (including their Tier 1 suppliers) and suppliers experience plant shutdowns, work stoppages, strikes, part shortages, etc., it could disrupt our shipments to these customers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. Automakers continue to experience volatility and uncertainty in executing planned new programs on time, due in part to continued vehicle complexity increases, which can result in delays or cancellations of new vehicle platforms, package configurations, and inaccurate volume forecasts. This makes it challenging for us to forecast future sales and manage costs, inventory, capital, engineering, research and development, and human resource investments, in addition to the aforementioned factors.\nKey Customers. We have a number of large customers, including three automotive customers which each account for 10% or more of our annual net sales in 2020 (including direct sales to OEM customers and sales through their Tier 1 suppliers): Volkswagen Group, Toyota Motor Company, and General Motors. The loss of all or a substantial portion of the sales to, or decreases in production by, any of these customers (or certain other significant customers) could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.\nPricing Pressures. We continue to experience on-going pricing pressures from our automotive customers and competitors, which have affected, and which will continue to affect our profit margins to the extent that we are unable to offset the price reductions with engineering and purchasing cost reductions, productivity improvements, increases in unit shipments of mirrors and electronics with advanced features, and/or new or advanced technologies, each of which pose an ongoing challenge, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.\nTariffs. The geo-political environment between the Unites States and other jurisdictions, including China and the European Union, continues to cause uncertainty on tariffs and trade. Starting in 2018, and throughout calendar year 2019, the United States enacted new tariffs on numerous raw materials that the Company imports from China, and likewise China also enacted retaliatory tariffs on the finished goods that the Company imports into China for distribution and sale in the China market. Such tariffs have increased the Company's input costs, and have the potential to challenge the Company's competitive position in foreign markets. The continuance of these tariffs and/or escalation of disputes in the geopolitical environment could continue to interfere with automotive supply chains and may have a continued negative impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and/or results of operations, especially since the Company primarily manufactures and ships from one location. We cannot predict what further action may be taken with respect to tariffs or trade relations between the U.S. and other governments, and any further changes in U.S. or international trade policy could have an adverse impact on our business.\nCompetition. We recognize that Magna Mirrors, our main competitor, may have considerably more resources available to it, and may present a formidable competitive threat. Additionally, other companies have demonstrated products that are competitive to our Full Display Mirror\u00ae system and other products. We acknowledge that dimming device (e.g., electrochromic) technology is the subject of research and development efforts by numerous third parties.\nFor example, our SmartBeam\u00ae product is a driver-assist feature for headlamp lighting control that competes with other multiple-function driver-assist features that include headlamp lighting control as one of the multiple functions. While we believe SmartBeam\u00ae is a low cost solution for a safety feature that makes nighttime driving safer by maximizing a vehicle's high-beam usage, competition from multiple-function driver-assist products has already and could continue to impact the success of SmartBeam\u00ae.\nOn March 31, 2014 the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers petitioned the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (\"NHTSA\") to allow automakers to use camera monitoring systems (\"CMS\") as an option to replace conventional rearview mirrors within North America, however, no final rule or legislation was made in response to this petition. At the annual SAE Government-Industry Meeting in January 2017, NHTSA requested that SAE develop Recommended Procedures for test protocols and performance criteria for CMS that would replace mirror systems on light vehicles in the U.S. market. SAE assigned the task to the Driver Vision Committee, and the SAE Driver Vision Committee created a CMS Task Force to draft the Recommended Procedures. NHTSA published a report dated October 2018 related to camera monitoring systems for outside mirror replacements. On October 10, 2019, an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) was published seeking public comment on permitting camera-based rear visibility systems, as an alternative to inside and outside rearview mirrors required under Federal motor vehicle safety standard (FMVSS) No. 111, \u201cRear Visibility,\u201d which currently requires that vehicles be equipped with rearview mirrors to provide drivers with a view of objects that are to their side or to their side and rear. This ANPRM builds on NHTSA's prior efforts to obtain supporting technical information, data, and analysis on CMS so that the agency can determine whether these systems can provide the same level of safety as the rearview mirrors currently required under FMVSS No. 111. The ANPRM states that one reason NHTSA is seeking additional information is because research conducted by NHTSA and others between 2006 and 2017 has consistently shown that prototype and preproduction camera-based rear visibility systems can exhibit safety-relevant performance issues.\nOn October 18, 2019, a petition for temporary exemption from FMVSS No. 111 submitted by Audi of America was published requesting NHTSA to grant a two-year exemption to sell up to 2,500 vehicles for each twelve month period (up to 5,000 vehicles) that are equipped with camera monitoring systems and do not include FMVSS No. 111 compliant outside mirrors.\nIn July 2016, a revision to UN-ECE Regulation 46 was published with an effective date of June 18, 2016, which allows for camera monitor systems to replace mirrors within Japan and European countries. Since January 2017, camera monitoring systems are also permitted as an alternative to replace mirrors in the Korean market. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company continues to believe rearview mirrors provide a robust, simple and cost effective means to view the surrounding areas of a vehicle and remain the primary safety function for rear vision today. Cameras, when used as the primary rear vision delivery mechanism, have some inherent limitations such as: electrical failure; cameras being blocked or obstructed; depth perception challenges; and viewing angle of the camera. Nonetheless, the Company continues designing and manufacturing not only rearview mirrors, but CMOS imagers and video displays as well. The Company believes that combining video displays with mirrors provides a more robust product by addressing all driving conditions in a single solution that can be controlled by the driver. The Company has been in production with the Company's Full Display Mirror\u00ae since 2015 and has been awarded programs with ten (10) OEM customers. The Company is currently shipping production Full Display Mirrors\u00ae to eight\nautomaker customers, which are General Motors, Subaru, Toyota, Nissan, Jaguar Land Rover, Mitsubishi, Aston Martin, and FCA. The Company's CMS solution uses three cameras to provide a comprehensive view of the sides and rear of the vehicle while still providing the traditional safety of interior and exterior mirrors, that still function when cameras are obstructed, or not functioning. The Company announced the CMS development program with Aston Martin. The Company has also previously announced that the Company continues to develop in the areas of imager performance, camera dynamic range, lens design, image processing from the camera to the display, and camera lens cleaning. The Company acknowledges that as such technology evolves over time, such as cameras replacing mirrors and/or autonomous driving, there could be increased competition.\nProduct Mix. We sell products that have varying profit margins. Our financial performance can be impacted depending on the mix of products we sell and to which customers, during a given period. The automotive industry is subject to rapid technological change, vigorous competition, short product life cycles and cyclical, ever-changing consumer demand patterns. When our customers are adversely affected by these factors, we may be similarly affected to the extent that our customers reduce the volume of orders for our products. As a result of such changes and circumstances impacting our customers, sales mix can shift which may have either favorable or unfavorable impact on revenue and would include shifts in regional growth, in OEM sales demand, as well as in consumer demand related to vehicle segment purchases and content penetration. A decrease in consumer demand for specific types of vehicles where we have traditionally provided higher value content could have a significant effect on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. Our forward guidance and estimates assume a certain geographic sales mix as well as a product sales mix. If actual results vary from this projected geographic and product mix of sales, our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nBusiness Combinations. We anticipate that acquisitions of businesses and assets may play a role in our future growth. We cannot be certain that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition targets, have resources available for or obtain financing for acquisitions on satisfactory terms, successfully acquire identified targets or manage timing of acquisitions with capital obligations across our businesses. Additionally, we may not be successful in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations, achieving projected synergies, and/or maximizing the value of acquired technologies and businesses. Competition for acquisition opportunities in the various industries in which we operate already exists and may increase, thereby potentially increasing our costs of making acquisitions or causing us to refrain from making further acquisitions. We are also subject to applicable antitrust laws and must avoid anticompetitive behavior. These and other acquisition-related factors may negatively and adversely impact our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.\nIntellectual Property. We believe that our patents and trade secrets provide us with a competitive advantage in automotive rearview mirrors, variable dimmable devices, certain electronics, and fire protection products, although no single patent is necessarily required for the success of our products. The loss of any significant combination of patents and trade secrets regarding our products could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. Lack of intellectual property protection in a number of countries, including China, represents a current and on-going risk for the Company.\nNew Technology and Product Development. We continue to invest significantly in engineering, research and development projects. Should these efforts ultimately prove unsuccessful, our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIntellectual Property Litigation and Infringement Claims. A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement and damages against us could affect business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. If a person or company claims that our products infringed their intellectual property rights, any resulting litigation could be costly, time consuming, and would divert the attention of management and key personnel from other business issues. The complexity of the technology involved in our business and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation significantly increases these risks and makes such risk part of our on-going business. To that end, we periodically obtain intellectual property rights, in the ordinary course of business, to strengthen our intellectual property portfolio and minimize potential risks of infringement. The increasing tendency of patents granted to others on combinations of known technology is a potential threat to our Company. Any of these adverse consequences could potentially have an effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nCredit Risk. Certain automakers and Tier 1 customers from time to time may consider the sale of certain business segments or bankruptcy as a result of financial stress. Should one or more of our larger customers (including sales through their Tier 1 suppliers) declare bankruptcy or sell their business, it could adversely affect the collection of receivables, our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. The current economic environment\ncontinues to cause increased financial pressures and production stresses on our customers, which could impact the timeliness of customer payments and ultimately the collectability of receivables.\nOur allowance for doubtful accounts primarily relates to financially distressed automotive mirror and electronics customers. We continue to work with these financially distressed customers in collecting past due balances. Refer to Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details regarding our allowance for doubtful accounts.\nSupply Chain Disruptions. As a result of just-in-time supply chains within our business and the automotive industry, disruptions in our supply chain are occurring due to the COVID-19 pandemic and can also occur due to natural disasters, other pandemics, work stoppages, strikes, bankruptcy, etc. Such circumstances are disrupting, and may further disrupt, our shipments to one or more automakers or Tier 1 customers, which adversely affects our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.\nBusiness Disruptions. Manufacturing of our proprietary products employing electro-optic technology is performed at our manufacturing facilities in Zeeland and Holland, Michigan. One of our manufacturing facilities is located in Holland, Michigan, which is approximately three miles from our other manufacturing facilities in Zeeland, Michigan. Should a catastrophic event occur, our ability to manufacture product, complete existing orders and provide other services could be severely impacted for an undetermined period of time. We have purchased business interruption insurance to address some of these risks. Our inability to conduct normal business operations for a period of time may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.\nIT Infrastructure. A failure of our information technology (\"IT\") infrastructure could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. We rely upon the capacity, reliability and security of our information technology infrastructure and our ability to expand and continually update this infrastructure in response to the changing needs of our business. For example, we have implemented enterprise resource planning and other IT systems in certain aspects of our businesses over a period of several years and continue to update and further implement new systems going forward. These systems may not perform as expected. We also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing necessary upgrades. If we experience a problem with the functioning of an important IT system or a security breach of our IT systems, the resulting disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. We, and certain of our third-party vendors, receive and store personal information in connection with our human resources operations and other aspects of our business. Despite our implementation of security measures, our IT systems, like all IT systems, are vulnerable to damages from computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyber-attack and other similar disruptions. Any system failure, accident or security breach could result in disruptions to our operations. A material network breach in the security of our IT systems could include the theft of our intellectual property, trade secrets or customer information. To the extent that any disruptions or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data, or an inappropriate disclosure of confidential or customer information, it could cause significant damage to our reputation, affect our relationships with our customers, lead to claims against the Company and ultimately harm our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.\nGovernment Regulations. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo (\"DRC\") and adjoining countries. As a result, in August 2012 the SEC adopted annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use conflict minerals mined from the DRC and adjoining countries in their products. These new requirements required due diligence efforts in 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020, and the Company has disclosed its findings annually to the SEC on Form SD around May 30 each year. As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering \"conflict free\" minerals necessary for our products, the Company cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain necessary conflict minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, the Company may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if the Company is unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in the Company's products through the procedures the Company may implement.\nThe European New Car Assessment Program (\"Euro NCAP\") provides an incentive for automobiles sold in Europe to apply safety technologies that include driver assist features such as lane detection, vehicle detection, and pedestrian detection as standard equipment. Euro NCAP compliant driver assist systems are also capable of including high beam assist as a function. The increased application of Euro NCAP on European vehicles has impacted and could continue to impact take rates for the Company's SmartBeam\u00ae application on these vehicles.\nOn December 8, 2015, NHTSA proposed changes to the Administration\u2019s 5-Star Safety Ratings for new vehicles (also known as the New Car Assessment Program or NCAP) and initiated a comment period. The proposed changes will, for the first time, encompass assessment of crash-avoidance technologies, which includes lower beam headlamp performance, semi-automatic headlamp switching, and blind spot detection. NHTSA originally intended to implement the enhancements in NCAP in 2018 beginning with model year 2019 vehicles. The NCAP implementation has been delayed. Under these proposed changes, the Company believes that its SmartBeam\u00ae technology will qualify with the semi-automatic headlamp NCAP rating system, and that its SmartBeam\u00ae technology and exterior mirrors with blind spot alert lighting can be included in a system that qualifies with the lower beam headlamp performance and blind spot detection NCAP rating system, respectively. On October 16, 2019, NHTSA issued a press release comparing NCAP to other regions\u2019 version of NCAP, identified new technologies that are not currently included in NCAP, and suggested Congress legislatively direct actions to improve NCAP. On January 14, 2021, NHTSA issued a request for comment regarding NCAP with advanced driver assist features, including forward collision, lane keeping, blind spot detection and forward pedestrian impact avoidance technologies.\nOn October 12, 2018, NHTSA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (\"NPRM\") for amendments to Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (\"FMVSS\") No. 108: Lamps, reflective devices, and associated equipment, and initiated a comment period. The NPRM proposes amendments that would permit the certification of adaptive driving beam head-lighting systems, if the manufacturer chooses to equip vehicles with these systems. NHTSA proposes to establish appropriate performance requirements to ensure the safe introduction of adaptive driving beam head-lighting systems if equipped on newly manufactured vehicles. The Company believes that its dynamic SmartBeam\u00ae lighting control system (dynamic forward lighting or DFL), which has been sold in markets outside of North America for several years, will meet the requirements of the new FMVSS No. 108 standards, if amended. The Company's SmartBeam\u00ae application has and will continue to be affected by increased competition suppliers of multi-function driver assist camera products, which are able to achieve some of the same functionality as SmartBeam\u00ae but at a lower cost, due to other suppliers leveraging similar hardware costs, but offering products with multiple software features.\nAs noted, on October 10, 2019, an ANPRM was published seeking public comment on permitting camera-based rear visibility systems, as an alternative to inside and outside rearview mirrors required under FMVSS No. 111, \u201cRear Visibility,\u201d which currently requires that vehicles be equipped with rearview mirrors to provide drivers with a view of objects that are to their side or to their side and rear. This ANPRM builds on NHTSA's prior efforts to obtain supporting technical information, data, and analysis on CMS so that the agency can determine whether these systems can provide the same level of safety as the rearview mirrors currently required under FMVSS No. 111. The ANPRM states that one reason NHTSA is seeking additional information is because research conducted by NHTSA and others between 2006 and 2017 has consistently shown that prototype and preproduction camera-based rear visibility systems can exhibit safety-relevant performance issues.\nAntitakeover Provisions. Our articles of incorporation, bylaws, and the laws of the state of Michigan include provisions that may provide our board of directors with adequate time to consider whether a hostile takeover offer is in our best interest and the best interests of our shareholders. These provisions, however, could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control.\nFluctuations in Market Price. The market price for our common stock has fluctuated, ranging from a low closing price of $20.09 to a high closing price of $34.06 during calendar year 2020. The overall market and the price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate. There may be a significant impact on the market price for our common stock relating to the issues discussed above or due to any of the following:\n\u2022Variations in our anticipated or actual operating results or the results of our competitors;\n\u2022Changes in investors\u2019 or analysts\u2019 perceptions of the risks and conditions of our business and in particular our primary industry;\n\u2022Intellectual property litigation and infringement claims;\n\u2022The size of the public float of our common stock;\n\u2022Market conditions, including the industry in which we operate; and\n\u2022General macroeconomic conditions.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nCOVID-19 Pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has already significantly impacted worldwide economic and industry conditions and has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition, and/or results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic began to materially impact the Company's operations late in the first quarter of 2020 and continues to affect our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations, by virtue of governmental authorities imposing mandatory closures, work-from-home orders, and social distancing protocols, as well as voluntary closures and other restrictions. Even as restrictions have eased and production has resumed by our customers in large part, production volumes have been, and are expected to continue to be, volatile.\nThe full extent of the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company, our customers, our supply chain, and our industries still depends on future developments, which remain highly uncertain, including the duration and severity of the current outbreak, subsequent outbreaks, and resulting actions taken by the Company or the various governments to contain or mitigate the spread of the coronavirus. These actions have already included, and could include more, work stoppages, quarantines, shutdowns, shelter-in-place orders or other limitations, which already have and could continue to: materially adversely affect the Company's ability to adequately staff and maintain our operations; impair our ability to sustain existing levels of financial liquidity; and impact the Company's business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. Additionally, if the negative global economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic continue, overall customer demand may decrease, which could continue to have a material and adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.\nWhile we cannot predict the duration and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic, the overall negative financial impact to the Company's business, financial condition, and/or results of operations has been material, is not fully known, and is expected to last for an extended period of time.\nIncome Taxes. The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions. Changes in tax rates, adoption of new tax laws or other additional tax policies, and other proposals to reform United States and foreign tax laws could adversely affect the Company's operating results, cash flows, and financial condition. The Company\u2019s domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions.\nEmployees. Our business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel. Throughout our Company, our ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire, retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce. Failure to ensure that we have the leadership capacity with the necessary skill sets and experience and a skilled workforce could impede our ability to deliver our growth objectives and execute our strategic plan. Organizational and reporting changes within management could result in, and low unemployment generally can cause, increased turnover. In addition, any unplanned turnover, inability to attract and retain key employees, including managers, or government mandated remote work could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nInternational Operations. We currently conduct operations in various countries and jurisdictions, including purchasing raw materials and other supplies from many different countries around the world, which subjects us to the legal, political, regulatory and social requirements as well as various economic conditions in these jurisdictions. Some of these countries are considered growth markets. International sales and operations, especially in growth markets, subject us to certain risks inherent in doing business abroad, including:\n\u2022Exposure to local economic, political and labor conditions;\n\u2022 Unexpected changes in laws, regulations, trade or monetary or fiscal policy, including interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and changes in the rate of inflation in the U.S. and other foreign countries;\n\u2022 Tariffs (as discussed herein), quotas, customs and other import or export restrictions and other trade barriers;\n\u2022Natural disasters, political crises, and public health crises (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), which have caused and will likely continue to cause downtime and closures at both supplier and customer facilities;\n\u2022Brexit, and its impact;\n\u2022Expropriation and nationalization;\n\u2022 Difficulty of enforcing agreements, collecting receivables and protecting assets through non-U.S. legal systems;\n\u2022 Reduced intellectual property protection;\n\u2022Withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries;\n\u2022 Investment restrictions or requirements;\n\u2022 Export and import restrictions;\n\u2022 Violence and civil unrest in local countries;\n\u2022 Compliance with the requirements of an increasing body of applicable anti-bribery laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar laws of various other countries; and\n\u2022Exposure related to buying, selling and financing in currencies other than the local currencies of the countries in which we operate.\nOther. Other issues and uncertainties which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations include:\n\u2022Volatility in commodity prices may adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or results of operations. If commodity prices rise, and if we are unable to recover these cost increases from our customers, such increases could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations;\n\u2022Increasing interest rates impact our financial performance due to an increase in realized losses on the sale of fixed income investments and/or recognized losses due to a corresponding impairment adjustment on investment securities;\n\u2022General economic conditions continue to be of concern in many of the regions in which we do business, given that our primary industry is greatly impacted by overall general economic conditions. Any continued adverse worldwide economic conditions, currency exchange rates, trade war, war or significant terrorist acts, could each affect worldwide automotive sales and production levels;\n\u2022Manufacturing yield issues may negatively impact our business, financial condition and/or results of operations; and\n\u2022Obligations and costs associated with addressing quality issues or warranty claims may adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.", "PERMNO": 38659, "SIC": 3714, "TIC": "GNTX"}
