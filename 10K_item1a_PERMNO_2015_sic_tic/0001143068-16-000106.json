{"cik": "1143068", "company": "GREAT PLAINS ENERGY INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-24", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nActual results in future periods for Great Plains Energy and KCP&L could differ materially from historical results and the forward-looking statements contained in this report. The Companies' business is influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual results and are often beyond their control. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that the Companies' management currently believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect the Companies. This information, as well as the other information included in this report and in the other documents filed with the SEC, should be carefully considered before making an investment in the securities of Great Plains Energy or KCP&L. Risk factors of KCP&L are also risk factors of Great Plains Energy.\nUtility Regulatory Risks:\nComplex utility regulation could adversely affect the Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nThe Companies are subject to, or affected by, extensive federal and state utility regulation, including regulation by the MPSC, KCC, FERC, NRC, North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) and SPP. The Companies must address in their business planning and management of operations the effects of existing and proposed laws and regulations and potential changes in the regulatory framework, including initiatives by federal and state legislatures, RTOs, utility regulators and taxing authorities. Failure of the Companies to obtain adequate rates or regulatory approvals in a timely manner, new or changed laws, regulations, standards, interpretations or other legal requirements, deterioration of the Companies' relationship with regulators and increased compliance costs and potential non-compliance consequences may materially affect the Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Additionally, regulators may impose burdensome restrictions and conditions on the Companies' transactions and ventures, rendering them less attractive from a financial or operational perspective. Certain of these risks are addressed in greater detail below.\nThe outcome of retail rate proceedings could have a material impact on the business and is largely outside the Companies' control.\nThe rates that KCP&L and GMO are allowed to charge their customers significantly influence the Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows. These rates are subject to the determination, in large part, of governmental entities outside of the Companies' control, including the MPSC, KCC and FERC.\nThe utility rate-setting principle generally applicable to KCP&L and GMO is that rates should provide a reasonable opportunity to recover expenses and investments prudently incurred to provide utility service plus a reasonable return on such investments. Various expenses incurred by KCP&L and GMO have been excluded from rates by the MPSC and KCC in past rate cases as not being prudently incurred or not providing utility customer benefit, and there is a risk that certain expenses incurred in the future may not be recovered in rates. Third-parties often intervene in the utilities' rate cases and argue that certain costs have not been prudently incurred or are otherwise not recoverable in rates. The MPSC and KCC also have in the past and may in the future exclude from rates all or a portion of investments in various facilities as not being prudently incurred or not being useful in providing utility service.\nAs discussed in the \"Environmental Risks\" and \"Financial Risks\" sections below, the Companies' capital expenditures are expected to be substantial over the next several years and there is a risk that a portion of the capital costs could be excluded from rates in future rate cases.\nThe Companies are also exposed to cost-recovery shortfalls due to the inherent \"regulatory lag\" in the rate-setting process, especially during periods of significant cost inflation or declining retail usage, as KCP&L's and GMO's utility rates are generally based on historical information and are not subject to adjustment between rate cases, other than principally for fuel, purchased power, transmission and property taxes for KCP&L in Kansas; fuel, purchased power, certain transmission costs and demand-side investments for KCP&L in Missouri; and fuel, purchased power, certain transmission costs, demand-side investments and renewable energy (solar rebates) for GMO. These and other factors may result in under-recovery of costs, failure to earn the authorized return on investment, or both.\nThere are mandatory renewable energy standards in Missouri and voluntary renewable energy goals in Kansas. There is also the potential for future federal or state mandatory energy efficiency requirements.\nFailure to timely recover the full investment costs of capital projects, the impact of renewable energy and energy efficiency programs, other utility costs and expenses due to regulatory disallowances, regulatory lag or other factors could lead to lowered credit ratings, reduced access to capital markets, increased financing costs, lower flexibility due to constrained financial resources and increased collateral security requirements, or reductions or delays in planned capital expenditures. In response to competitive, economic, political,\nlegislative, public perception (including, but not limited to, the Companies' environmental reputation) and regulatory pressures, the Companies may be subject to rate moratoriums, rate refunds, limits on rate increases, lower allowed returns on investments or rate reductions, including phase-in plans designed to spread the impact of rate increases over an extended period of time for the benefit of customers.\nRegulatory requirements regarding utility operations may increase costs and may expose the Companies to compliance penalties or adverse rate consequences.\nThe FERC, NERC and SPP have implemented and enforce an extensive set of transmission system reliability, cyber security and critical infrastructure protection standards that apply to public utilities, including KCP&L and GMO. The MPSC and KCC have the authority to implement utility operational standards and requirements, such as vegetation management standards, facilities inspection requirements and quality of service standards. In addition, the Companies are also subject to health, safety and other requirements enacted by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Labor and other federal and state agencies. As discussed more fully under \"Operational Risks,\" the NRC extensively regulates nuclear power plants, including Wolf Creek. The costs of existing, new or modified regulations, standards and other requirements could have an adverse effect on the Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows as a result of increased operations or maintenance and capital expenditures for new facilities or to repair or improve existing facilities. In addition, failure to meet quality of service, reliability, cyber security, critical infrastructure protection, operational or other standards and requirements could expose the Companies to penalties, additional compliance costs, or adverse rate consequences.\nEnvironmental Risks:\nThe Companies are subject to current and potential environmental requirements and the incurrence of environmental liabilities, any or all of which may adversely affect their business and financial results.\nThe Companies are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and permit requirements relating to air and water quality, waste management and disposal, natural resources and health and safety. In addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations and remediation costs for historical and pre-existing conditions, these laws, regulations and permits authorize the imposition of substantial penalties for noncompliance, including fines, injunctive relief and other sanctions. There is also a risk that new environmental laws and regulations, new administrative or judicial interpretations of environmental laws and regulations, or the requirements in new or renewed environmental permits could adversely affect the Companies' operations. In addition, there is also a risk of lawsuits brought by third parties alleging violations of environmental commitments or requirements, claiming creation of a public nuisance or other matters, and seeking injunctions or monetary damages or other damages. Certain federal courts have held that state and local governments and private parties have standing to bring climate change tort suits seeking company-specific emission reductions and damages.\nEnvironmental permits are subject to periodic renewal, which may result in more stringent permit conditions and limits. New facilities, or modifications of existing facilities, may require new environmental permits or amendments to existing permits. Delays in the environmental permitting process, public opposition and challenges, denials of permit applications, limits or conditions imposed in permits and the associated uncertainty may materially adversely affect the cost and timing of projects, and thus materially adversely affect the Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nKCP&L and GMO periodically seek recovery of capital costs and expenses for environmental compliance and remediation through rate increases; however, there can be no assurance that recovery of these costs would be granted. KCP&L and GMO may be subject to material adverse rate treatment in response to competitive, economic, political, legislative or regulatory pressures and/or public perception of the Companies' environmental reputation. The costs of compliance or noncompliance with environmental requirements, remediation costs, adverse outcomes of lawsuits, or failure to timely recover environmental costs could have a material adverse effect on the Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Certain of these matters are discussed in more detail below. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding certain significant\nenvironmental matters and Great Plains Energy's and KCP&L's current estimates of capital expenditures over the next five years to comply with environmental regulations.\nAir and Climate Change\nManagement believes it is possible that additional federal or relevant state or local laws or regulations could be enacted to address global climate change. At the international level, in December 2015 the Paris Agreement was adopted by nearly 200 countries. The Paris Agreement did not result in any new, legally binding obligations on the United States to meet a particular greenhouse gas emissions target, but establishes a framework for international cooperation on climate change. Additional international agreements legally binding on the United States may be reached in the future. Such new laws, regulations or treaties could mandate new or increased requirements to control or reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), which are created in the combustion of fossil fuels. These requirements could include, among other things, taxes or fees on fossil fuels or emissions, cap and trade programs, emission limits and clean or renewable energy standards. The Companies' current generation capacity is primarily coal-fired, and is estimated to produce about one ton of CO2 per MWh, or approximately 21 million tons and 15 million tons of CO2 per year for Great Plains Energy and KCP&L, respectively.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has enacted various regulations regarding the reporting and permitting of greenhouse gases and has proposed other regulations under the existing Clean Air Act. The EPA has established thresholds for greenhouse gas emissions, defining when Clean Air Act permits under the New Source Performance Standards, New Source Review and Title V operating permits programs would be required for new or existing industrial facilities and when the installation of best available control technology would be required. In August 2015, the EPA finalized its Clean Power Plan which sets CO2 emission performance rates for existing affected fossil fuel-fired electric generating units. Specifically, the EPA translated those performance rates into a state goal measured in mass and rate based on each state\u2019s generation mix. The states have the ability to develop their own plans for affected units to achieve either the performance rates directly or the state goals, with guidelines for the development, submittal and implementation of those plans. In February 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay of the Clean Power Plan putting the rule on hold pending review in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and any subsequent review by the U.S. Supreme Court if such review is sought. Compliance with the Clean Power Plan has the potential of having significant financial and operational impacts on Great Plains Energy and KCP&L; however, the ultimate financial and operational consequences to Great Plains Energy and KCP&L cannot be determined until the outcome of pending litigation is known and/or the state plans to implement the Clean Power Plan are known. Additional federal and/or state legislation or regulation respecting greenhouse gas emissions may be proposed or enacted in the future. Requirements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions may cause the Companies to incur significant costs relating to their ongoing operations (such as for additional environmental control equipment, retiring and replacing existing generation, re-powering existing plants to utilize alternative fuel or selecting more costly generation alternatives), to procure emission allowance credits, or due to the imposition of taxes, fees or other governmental charges as a result of such emissions.\nRules issued by the EPA regarding emissions of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants, nitrogen oxide (NOX), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and particulates are also in a state of flux. Some of these rules have been overturned by the courts and remanded to the EPA to be revised consistent with the courts' orders while others are pending judicial review or are otherwise subject to revision. It is unknown what requirements and standards will be imposed in the future, when the Companies may have to comply or what costs may ultimately be required.\nMissouri law currently requires at least 5% of the energy provided by certain utilities, including KCP&L and GMO, to come from renewable resources, including wind, solar, biomass and hydropower, increasing to 10% by 2018 and 15% by 2021, with a small portion (estimated to be about 2 MW for each of KCP&L and GMO) required to come from solar resources. Management believes that national renewable energy standards are also possible. The timing, provisions and impact of such possible future requirements,\nincluding the cost to obtain and install new equipment to achieve compliance, cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Such requirements could have a significant financial and operational impact on the Companies.\nWater\nThe Clean Water Act and associated regulations enacted by the EPA form a comprehensive program to restore and preserve water quality. All of the Companies' generating facilities, and certain of their other facilities, are subject to the Clean Water Act.\nIn May 2014, the EPA finalized regulations regarding protection of aquatic life from being killed or injured by cooling water intake structures. KCP&L\u2019s generation facilities with cooling water intake structures are subject to the best technology available standards based on studies completed to comply with such standards. The rule provides flexibility to work with the states to develop the best technology available to minimize aquatic species impacted by being pinned against intake screens or drawn into cooling water systems.\nKCP&L holds a permit from the MDNR covering water discharge from its Hawthorn Station. The permit authorizes KCP&L to, among other things, withdraw water from the Missouri River for cooling purposes and return the heated water to the Missouri River. KCP&L has applied for a renewal of this permit and the EPA has submitted an interim objection letter regarding the allowable amount of heat that can be contained in the returned water. Until this matter is resolved, KCP&L continues to operate under its current permit. Future water permit renewals at KCP&L's Iatan Station and at GMO's Sibley and Lake Road Stations could also be impacted by the allowable amount of heat that can be contained in the returned water. Great Plains Energy and KCP&L cannot predict the outcome of these matters; however, while less significant outcomes are possible, these matters may require a reduction in generation, installation of cooling towers or other technology to cool the water, or both, any of which could have a significant impact on Great Plains Energy's and KCP&L's results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nIn September 2015, the EPA finalized a revision of the technology-based effluent limitations guidelines and standards regulation to make the existing controls on discharges from steam electric power plants more stringent. The final rule sets the first federal limits on the levels of toxic metals in wastewater that can be discharged from power plants. The new requirements for existing power plants would be phased in between 2018 and 2023.\nFurther, the possible effects of climate change, including potentially increased temperatures and reduced precipitation, could make it more difficult and costly to comply with the current and final permit requirements.\nSolid Waste\nSolid and hazardous waste generation, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal are regulated at the federal and state levels under various laws and regulations. In April 2015, the EPA published final regulations to regulate coal combustion residuals (CCRs) under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Subtitle D to address the risks from the disposal of CCRs generated from the combustion of coal at electric generating facilities. The Companies principally use coal in generating electricity and dispose of CCRs in both on-site facilities and facilities owned by third parties. Current and future EPA regulations regarding the handling, disposal and remediation of CCRs could have a material adverse effect on the Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nRemediation\nUnder current law, the Companies are also generally responsible for any liabilities associated with the environmental condition of their properties and other properties at which the Companies arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances, including properties that they have previously owned or operated, such as manufactured gas plants (MGP), regardless of whether they were responsible for the\ncontamination or whether the liabilities arose before, during or after the time they owned or operated the properties or arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances.\nDue to all of the above, the Companies' projected capital and other expenditures for environmental compliance are subject to significant uncertainties, including the timing of implementation of any new or modified environmental requirements, the limits imposed by such requirements and the types and costs of the compliance alternatives selected by the Companies. As a result, costs to comply with environmental requirements cannot be estimated with certainty, and actual costs could be significantly higher than projections. New environmental laws and regulations affecting the operations of the Companies may be adopted, and new interpretations of existing laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to the Companies or their facilities, any of which may materially adversely affect the Companies' business, adversely affect the Companies' ability to continue operating its power plants as currently done and substantially increase environmental expenditures or liabilities in the future.\nFinancial Risks:\nFinancial market disruptions and declines in credit ratings may increase financing costs and/or limit access to the credit markets, which may adversely affect liquidity and results.\nThe Companies' capital requirements are expected to be substantial over the next several years. The Companies rely on access to short-term money markets, revolving credit facilities provided by financial institutions and long-term capital markets as significant sources of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by cash flows from operations. The Companies also rely on bank-provided credit facilities for credit support, such as letters of credit, to support operations. The amount of credit support required for operations varies and is impacted by a number of factors.\nGreat Plains Energy, KCP&L, GMO and certain of their securities are rated by Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's. These ratings impact the Companies' cost of funds and Great Plains Energy's ability to provide credit support for its subsidiaries. The interest rates on borrowings under the Companies' revolving credit agreements and on a portion of Great Plains Energy's debt are subject to increase as their respective credit ratings decrease. The amount of collateral or other credit support required under power supply and certain other agreements is also dependent on credit ratings.\nConditions in the United States capital and credit markets may deteriorate in the future for a variety of reasons, including, among others: instability in global markets, political uncertainty in the United States or abroad, fluctuations in the price of oil, geopolitical instability or other unforeseen events both in the United States and around the world. Adverse market conditions or decreases in Great Plains Energy's, KCP&L's or GMO's credit ratings could have material adverse effects on the Companies. These effects could include, among others: reduced access to capital and increased cost of funds; dilution resulting from equity issuances at reduced prices; changes in the type and/or increases in the amount of collateral or other credit support obligations required to be posted with contractual counterparties; increased nuclear decommissioning trust and pension and other post-retirement benefit plan funding requirements; rate case disallowance of KCP&L's or GMO's costs of capital; reductions in or delays of capital expenditures; or reductions in Great Plains Energy's ability to provide credit support for its subsidiaries. Any of these results could adversely affect the Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, market disruption and volatility could have an adverse impact on the Companies' lenders, suppliers and other counterparties or customers, causing them to fail to meet their obligations.\nGreat Plains Energy has guaranteed some of GMO\u2019s long-term and short-term debt and payments under these guarantees may adversely affect Great Plains Energy's liquidity.\nGreat Plains Energy has issued guarantees covering $97.7 million of GMO's long-term debt. Great Plains Energy also guarantees GMO's commercial paper program. At December 31, 2015, GMO had $43.7 million of commercial paper outstanding. The guarantees obligate Great Plains Energy to pay amounts owed by GMO directly to the holders of the guaranteed debt in the event GMO defaults on its payment obligations. Great Plains Energy may also guarantee debt that GMO may issue in the future. Any guarantee payments could adversely affect Great Plains Energy's liquidity.\nThe inability of Great Plains Energy's subsidiaries to provide sufficient dividends to Great Plains Energy, or the inability otherwise of Great Plains Energy to pay dividends to its shareholders and meet its financial obligations would have an adverse effect.\nGreat Plains Energy is a holding company with no significant operations of its own. The primary source of funds for payment of dividends to its shareholders and its other financial obligations is dividends paid to it by its subsidiaries, particularly KCP&L and GMO. The ability of Great Plains Energy's subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions, and accordingly, Great Plains Energy's ability to pay dividends on its common stock and meet its financial obligations principally depends on the actual and projected earnings and cash flow, capital requirements and general financial position of its subsidiaries, as well as regulatory factors, financial covenants, general business conditions and other matters.\nIn addition, Great Plains Energy, KCP&L and GMO are subject to certain corporate and regulatory restrictions and financial covenants that could affect their ability to pay dividends. Great Plains Energy's articles of incorporation restrict the payment of common stock dividends in the event common equity is 25% or less of total capitalization. In addition, if preferred stock dividends are not declared and paid when scheduled, Great Plains Energy could not declare or pay common stock dividends or purchase any common shares. If the unpaid preferred stock dividends equal four or more full quarterly preferred dividends, the preferred shareholders, voting as a single class, could elect the smallest number of directors necessary to constitute a majority of the full Great Plains Energy Board of Directors. Certain conditions in the MPSC and KCC orders authorizing the holding company structure require Great Plains Energy and KCP&L to maintain consolidated common equity of at least 30% and 35%, respectively, of total capitalization (including only the amount of short-term debt in excess of the amount of construction work in progress). Under the Federal Power Act, KCP&L and GMO generally can pay dividends only out of retained earnings. The revolving credit agreements of Great Plains Energy, KCP&L and GMO and the note purchase agreement for GMO's Series A, B and C Senior Notes contain a covenant requiring each company to maintain a consolidated indebtedness to consolidated total capitalization ratio of not more than 0.65 to 1.00. Great Plains Energy's Board of Directors regularly evaluates the common stock dividend policy and determines an appropriate dividend each quarter, after taking into account such factors as, among other things, earnings, financial condition and cash flows from KCP&L and GMO, as well as general economic conditions. While the corporate and regulatory restrictions and financial covenants discussed above are not expected to affect the Companies' ability to pay dividends at the current level in the foreseeable future, Great Plains Energy cannot assure common shareholders that the dividend will be paid in the future or that, if paid, dividends will be at the same amount or with the same frequency as in the past.\nMarket performance, increased retirements and retirement plan regulations could significantly impact retirement plan funding requirements and associated cash needs and expenses.\nSubstantially all of the Companies' and WCNOC's employees participate in defined benefit retirement and other post-retirement plans. Former employees also have accrued benefits in defined benefit retirement and other post-retirement plans. The costs of these plans depend on a number of factors, including the rates of return on plan assets, the level and nature of the provided benefits, discount rates, the interest rates used to measure required minimum funding levels, changes in benefit design, changes in laws or regulations, and the Companies' required or voluntary contributions to the plans. The Companies currently have substantial unfunded liabilities under these plans. Also, if the rate of retirements exceeds planned levels, or if these plans experience adverse market returns on investments, or if interest rates materially fall, the Companies' contributions to the plans could rise substantially over historical levels. In addition, changes in accounting rules and assumptions related to future costs, returns on investments, interest rates and other actuarial assumptions, including projected retirements, could have a significant impact on the Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nThe use of derivative contracts in the normal course of business could result in losses that could negatively impact the Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nThe Companies use derivative instruments, such as swaps, options, futures and forwards, to manage commodity and financial risks. Losses could be recognized as a result of volatility in the market values of these contracts, if a counterparty fails to perform, or if the underlying transactions which the derivative instruments are intended to hedge fail to materialize. In the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these financial instruments can involve management's judgment or the use of estimates. As\na result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contracts.\nAs a service provider to GMO, KCP&L may have exposure to GMO's financial performance and operations.\nGMO has no employees of its own. KCP&L employees operate and manage GMO's properties, and KCP&L charges GMO for the cost of these services. These arrangements may pose risks to KCP&L, including possible claims arising from actions of KCP&L employees in operating GMO's properties and providing other services to GMO. KCP&L's claims for reimbursement for services provided to GMO are unsecured and rank equally with other unsecured obligations of GMO. KCP&L's ability to be reimbursed for the costs incurred for the benefit of GMO depends on the financial ability of GMO to make such payments.\nCustomer and Weather-Related Risks:\nThe results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Companies can be materially affected by changes in customer electricity consumption.\nChanges in customer electricity consumption due to sustained financial market disruptions, downturns or sluggishness in the economy, technological advances, energy efficiency or other factors may adversely affect the Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nTechnological advances, energy efficiency, or other energy conservation measures could reduce customer electricity consumption. KCP&L and GMO generate electricity at central station power plants to achieve economies of scale and produce electricity at a competitive cost. There are distributed generation technologies that produce electricity, including microturbines, wind turbines, fuel cells and solar cells, that have recently become more cost competitive. If this trend continues, the Companies customer electricity consumption could be reduced. Changes in technology could also alter the channels through which the Companies\u2019 customers purchase or use electricity, which could reduce the Companies customer electricity consumption.\nWeather is a major driver of the Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flow.\nWeather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas and affect the price of energy commodities. Great Plains Energy and KCP&L are significantly impacted by seasonality, with approximately one-third of their retail electric revenues recorded in the third quarter. Unusually mild winter or summer weather can adversely affect sales. In addition, severe weather, including but not limited to tornados, snow, rain, flooding and ice storms can be destructive causing outages and property damage that can potentially result in additional expenses, lower revenues and additional capital restoration costs. KCP&L's and GMO's rates may not always be adjusted timely and adequately to reflect these increased costs. Some of the Companies' generating stations utilize water from the Missouri River for cooling purposes. Low water and flow levels can increase maintenance costs at these stations and, if these levels were to get low enough, could require modifications to plant operations. The possible effects of climate change (such as increased temperatures, increased occurrence of severe weather or reduced precipitation, among other possible results) could potentially increase the volatility of demand and prices for energy commodities, increase the frequency and impact of severe weather, increase the frequency of flooding or decrease water and flow levels. To the extent the frequency of extreme weather events increases, this could increase the Companies' cost in providing service.\nOperational Risks:\nOperational risks may adversely affect the Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nThe operation of the Companies' electric generation, transmission, distribution and information systems involves many risks, including breakdown or failure of equipment, aging infrastructure, processes and personnel performance; problems that delay or increase the cost of returning facilities to service after outages; limitations that may be imposed by equipment conditions or environmental, safety or other regulatory requirements; fuel supply or fuel transportation reductions or interruptions; labor disputes; difficulties with the implementation or continued operation of information systems; transmission scheduling constraints; and catastrophic events such as fires, floods, droughts, explosions, terrorism, cyber threats, severe weather or other similar occurrences. Furthermore, to the\nextent that a cyber attack was successful, customer and employee information may be stolen, equipment may be destroyed or damaged and operations may be disrupted. Any such equipment or system outage or constraint can, among other things:\n\u2022\nin the case of generation equipment, affect operating costs, increase capital requirements and costs, increase purchased power volumes and costs and reduce wholesale sales opportunities;\n\u2022\nin the case of transmission equipment, affect operating costs, increase capital requirements and costs, require changes in the source of generation and affect wholesale sales opportunities and the ability to meet regulatory reliability and security requirements;\n\u2022\nin the case of distribution systems, affect revenues and operating costs, increase capital requirements and costs, and affect the ability to meet regulatory service metrics and customer expectations; and\n\u2022\nin the case of information systems, affect the control and operations of generation, transmission, distribution, customer information and other business operations and processes, increase operating costs, increase capital requirements and costs, and affect the ability to meet regulatory reliability and security requirements and customer expectations.\nWith the exception of Hawthorn No. 5, which was substantially rebuilt in 2001, and Iatan No. 2, which was completed in 2010, all of KCP&L's and GMO's coal-fired generating units and its nuclear generating unit were constructed prior to 1986. The age of these generating units increases the risk of unplanned outages, reduced generation output and higher maintenance expense. Training, preventive maintenance and other programs have been implemented, but there is no assurance that these programs will prevent or minimize future breakdowns or failures of the Companies' generation facilities or increased maintenance expense. Furthermore, aging transmission and distribution facilities are more prone to failure than new facilities, which results in higher maintenance expense and the need to replace these facilities with new infrastructure. The higher maintenance costs and capital expenditures for new replacement infrastructure could cause additional rate volatility for the Companies' customers, resistance by the Companies' regulators to allow customer rate increases and/or regulatory lag.\nThe Companies currently have general liability and property insurance in place to cover their facilities in amounts that management considers appropriate. These policies, however, do not cover the Companies' transmission or distribution systems, and the cost of repairing damage to these systems may adversely affect the Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles and do not include business interruption coverage. Insurance coverage may not be available in the future at reasonable costs or on commercially reasonable terms, and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of, or any damage to, any of the Companies' facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss or damage.\nThese and other operating events may reduce the Companies' revenues, increase their costs, or both, and may materially affect their results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nThe cost and schedule of capital projects may materially change and expected performance may not be achieved.\nGreat Plains Energy's and KCP&L's businesses are capital intensive. The Companies currently have significant capital projects pending and may also have significant capital projects in the future. The risks of any capital project include: that actual costs may exceed estimated costs due to inflation or other factors; risks associated with the incurrence of additional debt or the issuance of additional equity to fund such projects; delays that may occur in obtaining permits and materials; the failure of suppliers and contractors to perform as required under their contracts; inadequate availability or increased cost of equipment, materials or qualified craft labor; delays related to inclement weather; the scope, cost and timing of projects may change due to new or changed environmental requirements, health and safety laws or other factors; and other events beyond the Companies' control may occur that may materially affect the schedule, cost and performance of these projects.\nThese and other risks could materially increase the estimated costs of capital projects, delay the in-service dates of projects, adversely affect the performance of the projects, and/or require the Companies to purchase additional\nelectricity to supply their respective retail customers until the projects are completed. Thus, these risks may significantly affect the Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nFailure of one or more generation plant co-owners to pay their share of construction or operations and maintenance costs could increase the Companies' costs and capital requirements.\nKCP&L owns 47% of Wolf Creek, 50% of La Cygne Station, 70% of Iatan No. 1 and 55% of Iatan No. 2. GMO owns 18% of both Iatan units and 8% of Jeffrey Energy Center. The remaining portions of these facilities are owned by other utilities that are contractually obligated to pay their proportionate share of capital and other costs.\nWhile the ownership agreements provide that a defaulting co-owner's share of the electricity generated can be sold by the non-defaulting co-owners, there is no assurance that the revenues received will recover the increased costs borne by the non-defaulting co-owners. Occurrence of these or other events could materially increase the Companies' costs and capital requirements.\nThe Companies are subject to information security risks and risks of unauthorized access to their systems.\nIn the course of their businesses, the Companies handle a range of system security and sensitive customer information. KCP&L and GMO are subject to laws and rules issued by different agencies concerning safeguarding and maintaining the confidentiality of this information. A security breach of the utilities' information systems such as theft or the inappropriate release of certain types of information, including confidential customer information or system operating information, could have a material adverse impact on the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Companies.\nKCP&L and GMO operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructures. Despite implementation of security measures, the technology systems are vulnerable to disability, failures, employee error or malfeasance, or unauthorized access. Such failures or breaches of the systems could impact the reliability of generation, transmission and distribution systems, result in legal claims and proceedings, damage the Companies' reputation and also subject the Companies to financial harm. If the technology systems were to fail or be breached and not recovered in a timely way, critical business functions could be impaired and sensitive confidential data could be compromised, which could have a material adverse impact on the Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nKCP&L is exposed to risks associated with the ownership and operation of a nuclear generating unit, which could result in an adverse effect on the Companies' business and financial results.\nKCP&L owns 47% of Wolf Creek. The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities, including Wolf Creek. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines, shut down the facilities, or both, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. Additionally, the non-compliance of other nuclear facility operators with applicable regulations or the occurrence of a serious nuclear incident anywhere in the world could result in increased regulation of the nuclear industry as a whole. Any revised safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could result in substantial capital expenditures at Wolf Creek.\nWolf Creek has the lowest fuel cost per MWh of any of KCP&L's generating units. An extended outage of Wolf Creek, whether resulting from NRC action, an incident at the plant or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on KCP&L's results of operations, financial position and cash flows in the event KCP&L incurs higher replacement power and other costs that are not recovered through rates or insurance. If a long-term outage occurred, the state regulatory commissions could reduce rates by excluding the Wolf Creek investment from rate base. Wolf Creek was constructed prior to 1986 and the age of Wolf Creek increases the risk of unplanned outages and results in higher maintenance costs.\nOwnership and operation of a nuclear generating unit exposes KCP&L to risks regarding decommissioning costs at the end of the unit's life. KCP&L contributes annually based on estimated decommissioning costs to a tax-qualified trust fund to be used to decommission Wolf Creek. The funding level assumes a projected level of return on trust assets. If the actual return on trust assets is below the projected level or actual decommissioning costs are higher\nthan estimated, KCP&L could be responsible for the balance of funds required and may not be allowed to recover the balance through rates.\nKCP&L is also exposed to other risks associated with the ownership and operation of a nuclear generating unit, including, but not limited to, (i) potential liability associated with the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from the operation of a nuclear generating unit, (ii) the storage, handling, disposal and potential release (by accident, through third-party actions or otherwise) of radioactive materials and (iii) uncertainties with respect to contingencies and assessments if insurance coverage is inadequate. Under the structure for insurance among owners of nuclear generating units, KCP&L is also liable for potential retrospective premium assessments (subject to a cap) per incident at any commercial reactor in the country and losses in excess of insurance coverage.\nThe structure of the regional power market in which the Companies operate could have an adverse effect on the Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nIn March 2014, the SPP launched its Integrated Marketplace. Similar to other RTO or ISO markets, this marketplace determines which generating units among market participants should run, within the operating constraints of a unit, at any given time for maximum cost-effectiveness. In the event that KCP&L's and GMO's generating units are not among the lowest cost generating units operating within the market, KCP&L and GMO could experience decreased levels of wholesale electricity sales.\nA market for Transmission Congestion Rights (TCR) is also included as part of the Integrated Marketplace. TCRs are financial instruments used to hedge transmission congestion charges. Both KCP&L and GMO acquire TCRs for the purpose of hedging against transmission congestion charges. There is a risk that KCP&L and GMO could incorrectly model the amount of TCRs needed, or that the TCRs acquired could be ineffective in hedging against transmission congestion charges which could lead to increased purchased power costs.\nThe rules governing the various regional power markets may change from time to time and such changes could impact the Companies' costs and revenues. Because the manner in which RTO's or ISO's will evolve is unclear, the Companies are unable to assess fully the impact of these changes.\nLitigation Risks:\nThe outcome of legal proceedings cannot be predicted. An adverse finding could have a material adverse effect on the Companies' results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nThe Companies are party to various material litigation and regulatory matters arising out of their business operations. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot presently be determined, nor, in many cases, can the liability that could potentially result from a negative outcome in each case be reasonably estimated. The liability that the Companies may ultimately incur with respect to any of these cases in the event of a negative outcome may be in excess of amounts currently reserved and insured against with respect to such matters.", "PERMNO": 24432, "SIC": 4911, "TIC": "GXP"}
