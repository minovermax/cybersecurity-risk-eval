{"cik": "1041024", "company": "ROCKWELL MEDICAL, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-03", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below before purchasing our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could fall, and you may lose all or part of the money you paid to buy our common stock.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR DRUG BUSINESS\nAlthough Triferic\u2122 has recently been approved by the FDA, we may not be able to commercialize it successfully.\nThe commercial success of Triferic\u2122 will depend on a number of factors, including the following:\n\u2022 IV iron currently dominates treatment for iron deficiency and Triferic\u2122 will have to compete against it and possibly other existing and future products;\n\u2022 It may be difficult to gain market acceptance from dialysis chains, anemia managers and nephrologists or such acceptance may be slower than expected. Market acceptance will depend on a number of factors, such as demonstration of Triferic\u2122's safety and efficacy, cost-effectiveness, advantages over existing products, and the reimbursement policies of government and third party payers, including Medicare;\n\u2022 Maintaining compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements applicable to Triferic\u2122 or which apply generally to the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping applicable to the product;\n\u2022 The effectiveness of our marketing, sales and distribution strategies and operations for development and commercialization, and our ability to execute our marketing strategy without significant additional expenditures;\n\u2022 Our ability to avoid third party patent interference or patent infringement claims;\n\u2022 A continued acceptable safety profile of Triferic\u2122; and\n\u2022 Discovery of previously unknown problems with Triferic\u2122 or with any third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements.\nAny of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our ability to manufacture and market Triferic\u2122. These factors are largely beyond our control. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to generate revenues through the sale of Triferic\u2122. If we are not successful in commercializing Triferic\u2122, or are significantly delayed in doing so, our entire investment in Triferic\u2122 may be worthless, our licensing rights could be forfeited and the price of our common stock could substantially decline. Even if we were successful in commercializing Triferic\u2122, due to the highly concentrated nature of the market, our continued success may depend on adoption of Triferic\u2122 by a few customers.\nTriferic\u2122 is currently limited to use in patients receiving hemodialysis treatments and has not been approved for other indications. Regulatory approval for any approved product is limited by the FDA to those specific indications and conditions for which clinical safety and efficacy have been demonstrated, which may limit our ability to market our drug products.\nWhile physicians may choose to prescribe drugs for uses that are not described in the product's labeling and for uses that differ from those tested in clinical studies and approved by regulatory authorities, our ability to promote the products or encourage our customers to use the products is limited to those indications that are specifically approved by the FDA as safe and effective. Any new indication for an approved product also requires FDA approval. If we are not able to obtain FDA approval for any other indications for Triferic\u2122, our ability to effectively market and sell Triferic\u2122 may be reduced and our business may be adversely affected. Moreover, if our promotional activities fail to comply with the FDA's regulations or guidelines, we may be subject to warnings from, or enforcement action by, the FDA that may include penalties, fines, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, suspension of production, denial of future regulatory approvals, withdrawal or suspension of existing regulatory approvals, operating restrictions, injunctions and criminal prosecution, any of which could materially harm our business.\nIf we do not obtain protection under the Hatch-Waxman Act to extend patent protection for Triferic\u2122, our business may be harmed.\nThe United States Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, more commonly known as the \"Hatch-Waxman Act,\" provides that patent holders may apply for an extension of patent term for drugs for a period of up to five years to compensate for time spent in development and regulatory approval. There can be no assurance that we will receive the extension of the patent term provided under the Hatch-Waxman Act for either of the licensed Triferic\u2122 patents expiring in 2016. If we fail to receive such extension, our ability to prevent competitors from manufacturing, marketing and selling generic versions of Triferic\u2122 could be impaired and we would have to rely on the protection afforded us by the United States patent we hold on the synthesis and formulation of our pharmaceutical grade formulation of Triferic\u2122 which expires in 2029 or on other patents related to Triferic\u2122 that may be issued to us in the future.\nAlthough Calcitriol has been approved by the FDA, we may not be able to commercialize it successfully.\nWe have received FDA approval to manufacture a generic version of Calcitriol, but we still must meet certain ongoing regulatory requirements for product testing and stability of our commercially marketed products. If our testing does not meet approvable standards, if we are unable to find one or more approved suppliers that can make the product in sufficient quantities or if we experience operational issues with our supplier, we may not be able to market Calcitriol or the launch may be delayed.\nThe market for generic drugs such as Calcitriol is generally very competitive, which may make it difficult for us to capture significant market share. If we have success in capturing market share with Calcitriol, it may attract other entrants to market their own Calcitriol product, which could have a material adverse effect on our future revenues and results of operations. Branded competitors may aggressively lower their prices to maintain market share.\nWe may not be successful in obtaining foreign regulatory approvals or in arranging an out-licensing or other venture to realize commercialization of our drug products outside of the United States. If we are successful in out-licensing our drug products, the licensee or partner may not be effective at marketing our products in certain markets or at all.\nThe approval procedures for marketing our new drug products, such as Triferic\u2122, outside the United States vary from country to country, can be difficult to obtain and carry the same risks as FDA approval. In particular, regulatory approval in foreign countries may require additional testing and may otherwise be expensive and time consuming to undertake. Even after foreign approvals are obtained, further delays may be encountered before products may be marketed. Many countries require additional government approval for price reimbursement under national health insurance systems.\nEven if we obtain the necessary foreign approval in a particular market, we do not have substantial expertise selling and marketing on an international level and therefore may not be successful in realizing commercial value from our products. Our strategy for addressing the need for expertise in obtaining foreign approvals and marketing in foreign markets is to out-license rights to our drugs in markets outside the United States. However, we may not be successful in finding a partner or partners who will be willing to invest in our drugs outside the United States. If we are not successful in out-licensing our drugs outside of the United States or entering into some other business development arrangement to obtain the necessary approvals to commercialize them, we may be forced to seek regulatory approval and market these products ourselves. If we elect to seek approval ourselves, it may take longer than expected to obtain regulatory approval and to market and manufacture our drugs, and we may decide to delay or abandon development efforts in certain markets.\nAny such delay or abandonment, or any failure to receive one or more foreign approvals, may have an adverse effect on the benefits otherwise expected from marketing in foreign countries.\nIf we are successful in obtaining a business partner or partners to commercialize our products in foreign markets, we will be dependent upon their effectiveness in selling and marketing our products in those foreign markets. These partners may face stiff competition, government price regulations, generic versions of our drug products, violations of our intellectual property rights and other negative events or may otherwise be ineffective in commercializing our products, any of which could reduce the market potential for our products and our success in those markets.\nWe will rely on third party suppliers for raw materials, packaging components and manufacturing of our drug products. We may not be able to obtain the raw materials, proper components or manufacturing capacity we need, or the cost of the materials, components or manufacturing capacity may be higher than expected, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our expected results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to obtain needed raw materials, packaging components and manufacturing capacity for a variety of reasons, including among others:\n\u2022 We may be required to purchase certain raw materials and packaging components from unaffiliated third- party suppliers who may not be able to supply us consistently or at all;\n\u2022 Regulatory requirements or action by regulatory agencies or others, including delays in receiving necessary approvals;\n\u2022 Adverse financial or other strategic developments at or affecting the supplier or contract manufacturer;\n\u2022 Unexpected demand for or shortage of raw materials or packaging components;\n\u2022 Failure to comply with cGMP standards which results in quality or product failures, adulteration, contamination and/or recall;\n\u2022 Limitations in capacity of contract manufacturers; and\n\u2022 Changes in product demand.\nIf we are unable to obtain the raw materials, components and manufacturing capacity we require, or if we are charged more than expected for these items, we may not be able to produce the desired quantities of our drug products or our expected gross profit margins may be materially adversely affected.\nBefore it can be marketed, an investigational drug requires FDA approval, which is a long, expensive process with no guarantee of success.\nPerforming clinical trials and obtaining FDA approval for any drug can take a long time. Clinical trials typically take months or years to complete. Once trials are completed and the NDA, is submitted to the FDA, the FDA may find deficiencies in our NDA, may raise safety or efficacy concerns or may otherwise require additional clinical testing or impose other requirements before granting approval, which could significantly delay approval or result in us not receiving approval at all.\nClinical trials and the NDA approval process are also expensive. Any such delays, additional testing or other requirements may require us to raise additional capital, which may not be available when needed or may be available only on terms that are not in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, or which result in substantial dilution of shareholders' voting power and ownership. If approval is not granted, our entire investment in the related products may be worthless, any licensing rights could be forfeited and the price of our common stock could substantially decline.\nOur drug business will depend on government funding of health care, and changes could impact our ability to be paid in full for our products, increase prices or cause consolidation in the dialysis provider market.\nMany dialysis providers receive the majority of their funding from the government and are supplemented by payments from private health care insurers. These providers depend on Medicare and Medicaid funding to be viable businesses. A variety of changes to health insurance and reimbursement are included in health reform legislation enacted by Congress in recent years. Some of these changes could have a negative impact on Medicare and Medicaid funding, which fund the majority of dialysis costs in the United States, and on reimbursement protocols. If Medicare and Medicaid funding were to\nbe materially decreased, these providers would be severely impacted, increasing our risk of not being paid in full. An increase in our exposure to uncollectible accounts could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nSince 2011, CMS has continued to modify reimbursement policies for dialysis under the ESRD prospective payment system generally resulting in lower payment to dialysis providers. We anticipate that dialysis providers will continue to seek ways to reduce their costs per treatment due to this change in reimbursement practice which could reduce our sales and profitability and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCMS has also introduced a quality incentive program for dialysis facilities and posts each facility's total performance score on the CMS website. Low performance scores at our customers could result in a reduction in patient volume and a decrease in sales for those customers.\nAs a result of these changes to Medicare reimbursement, the dialysis provider industry may continue to consolidate. This may result in increased purchasing leverage for providers across all dialysis product categories and increased pricing pressure on all suppliers to the industry.\nHealth care reform could adversely affect our business.\nThe federal and state governments in the United States, as well as many foreign governments, from time to time explore ways to reduce medical care costs through health care reform. The federal Medicare and Medicaid programs are facing financial challenges and are looking at ways to reduce the costs of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Similarly, many states have large deficits which may prove unsustainable, resulting in defaults on state debt obligations which may ultimately result in the reduction or curtailment of health care benefits or state Medicaid reimbursement.\nIn the United States, Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, referred to collectively as PPACA, which has resulted in significant changes to the health care payment and delivery system. The PPACA requires employers to provide employees with insurance coverage that meets minimum eligibility and coverage requirements or face penalties. The PPACA also includes provisions that impact the number of individuals with insurance coverage, including expansion of those eligible for Medicaid in some states, the types of coverage and level of health benefits that are required and the amount of payment providers performing health care services receive. The PPACA imposes implementation through 2020. The United States government faces structural deficits that may require changes to government funded healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid which may negatively impact customers of our products. Our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows and ability to commercialize our drug products could be materially impacted by the PPACA, future health care reform or reduced Medicare and Medicaid spending by the federal government.\nDevice and pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to report annually to the FDA regarding certain financial relationships they have with physicians and teaching hospitals. This reporting requirement will increase governmental scrutiny on our contractual relationships with physicians and teaching hospitals and will increase the risk that inadvertent violations result in liability under the federal fraud and abuse laws, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR CONCENTRATE BUSINESS\nThe Distribution Agreement with Baxter may be terminated or Baxter may lose exclusivity, requiring us to resume commercialization, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nBaxter may terminate the Distribution Agreement at any time at its discretion upon 270 days' written notice to us. In addition, Baxter may terminate the Distribution Agreement if:\n\u2022 We are in bankruptcy or insolvent;\n\u2022 We are in breach of the agreement and have failed to cure the breach within the applicable cure period;\n\u2022 Prices increase beyond certain thresholds and notice is provided within 45 days after the true up payment is due for the year in which the price threshold is exceeded;\n\u2022 We have a change of control; or\n\u2022 Baxter gives us written notice that it has been enjoined by a court of competent jurisdiction from selling in the United States any product covered by the Distribution Agreement due to a claim of intellectual property infringement or misappropriation relating to such product.\nIn addition, if Baxter were to fail to purchase its minimum purchase requirement, its distribution rights may become non-exclusive. If, after December 31, 2017, the Distribution Agreement is terminated or Baxter's rights become non-exclusive, we would be required to reassume distribution of hemodialysis concentrate and ancillary products in the United States and various foreign countries and re-establish commercial arrangements with our current customers. Further, our concentrate products are distribution-intensive, resulting in a high cost to deliver relative to the selling prices of our products and we may have to re-establish, or may be unable to maintain, competitive pricing for our products in order to be profitable. If the Distribution Agreement is terminated or Baxter's distribution rights become non-exclusive, such events could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be required to repay a portion of the fees received from Baxter, which could materially and adversely affect our financial position and cash reserves.\nPursuant to the terms of the Distribution Agreement, we may be required to repay a portion of the upfront fee and a portion of the facility fee to Baxter upon the occurrence of a \"Refund Trigger Event.\" A \"Refund Trigger Event\" means any of the following:\n\u2022 A change of control of the Company involving any of certain specified companies;\n\u2022 A termination by Baxter due to our bankruptcy, insolvency or uncured breach, or due to price increases that exceed the stated thresholds;\n\u2022 A termination by either party due to a force majeure;\n\u2022 The settlement or adjudication of any claim, action or litigation relating to a covered product that materially and adversely affects Baxter's commercialization of the product; and\n\u2022 Any regulatory action or ruling relating to a covered product that materially and adversely affects Baxter's commercialization of the product.\nAny of these events would obligate us to repay 50% of the $20 million upfront fee and 50% of the facility fee if the event occurs prior to December 31, 2016, 33% if the event occurs in 2017 or 2018, and 25% if the event occurs in 2019, 2020 or 2021. Any such repayment could result in a material negative impact on our financial condition and cash reserves.\nIn addition, if Baxter terminates the Distribution Agreement because it has been enjoined by a court of competent jurisdiction from selling in the United States any product covered by the Distribution Agreement due to a claim of intellectual property infringement or misappropriation relating to such product prior to the end of 2018, Baxter would be entitled to a refund of up to $10 million, or $6.6 million if the termination occurs in 2019.\nIf we are required to make any such refund payment, we may need to reallocate funds from other parts of our business, which could force us to change or delay plans for use of that capital. We may be forced to obtain financing or raise capital on terms that are unfavorable to us, or financing or additional capital may not be available at all. In any such event, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe transition to Baxter of commercialization of our concentrate and ancillary products may not be successful.\nIn October 2014, we entered into our Distribution Agreement with Baxter pursuant to which Baxter will become our exclusive agent for commercializing our hemodialysis concentrate and ancillary products in the United States and various foreign countries. If Baxter were to commit insufficient financial and other resources to the marketing and distribution of our products, or if our products were to lose focus within Baxter or are otherwise not being marketed as effectively as we have marketed them in the past, unit sales of our products may fall, resulting in lower revenues and gross margin for us, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, we may not be able to transition the sales and marketing activities of these products to Baxter successfully or Baxter could fail to price the product adequately to allow its sales of our products to be profitable to it, either of which could cause Baxter to exercise its right to terminate the Distribution Agreement or to fail to purchase the minimum requirements and allow its distribution rights to become non-exclusive. Any such termination or failure could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA few customers account for a substantial portion of the end user sales of our concentrate products. The loss of any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow from our concentrate business.\nBeginning in October 2014, our concentrate and ancillary products are primarily sold to or through Baxter. Its sales of our products are highly concentrated in a few customers and Baxter's loss of any of those customers could adversely affect our results of operations. One customer in particular accounted for nearly half of our sales in each of the last three years and for a substantial number of the clinics we serve. If Baxter were to lose this customer or the relationship with any other major dialysis chain customers, it could have a substantial negative impact on our cash flow and operating results.\nThe concentrate market is very competitive and has a large competitor with substantial resources.\nThere is intense competition in the hemodialysis products market. The primary competitor in the market for our concentrate products is a large diversified company which has substantial financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, research and management resources. Our distributor, Baxter, may not be able to successfully compete with them or other companies. The primary competitor has historically used product bundling and low pricing as marketing techniques to capture market share of the products we sell. Baxter may be at a disadvantage in competing against their marketing strategies to sell our products. Furthermore, the primary competitor is vertically integrated and is the largest provider of dialysis services in the United States, treating approximately 37% of all U.S. patients through its clinics. This competitor has routinely acquired smaller clinic chain operations that we\nservice and may acquire more of the customers we service in the future. In addition, if the Distribution Agreement were to terminate or if the distribution rights were to become non-exclusive, Baxter may be able to compete with us, which could materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe may be affected materially and adversely by increases in raw material costs.\nA significant portion of our costs relates to chemicals and other raw materials, which are subject to price volatility based on demand and are highly influenced by the overall level of economic activity in the U.S. and abroad. These costs have tended to rise from year to year and are likely to continue to rise in the future. Under our Distribution Agreement with Baxter, such cost inflation may result in increases in the prices we charge Baxter. If these increases exceed specified levels in the Distribution Agreement, Baxter is permitted to terminate the Distribution Agreement and obtain a refund of a portion of the fees we received from Baxter. Any such termination or refund would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nOur concentrate business is highly regulated, which increases our costs and the risk and consequence of noncompliance.\nAlthough our hemodialysis concentrates have been cleared by the FDA, it could rescind these clearances and any new products or modifications to our current products that we develop could fail to receive FDA clearance. If the FDA rescinds or denies any current or future clearances or approvals for our products, we would be prohibited from selling those products in the United States until we obtain such clearances or approvals. Our business would be adversely affected by any such prohibition, any delay in obtaining necessary regulatory approvals, and any limits placed by the FDA on our intended use. Our products are also subject to federal regulations regarding good manufacturing practices and quality. Our failure to comply with these regulations could result in FDA action or product liability litigation adverse to us. Any of these events could constitute a breach by us of the Distribution Agreement, providing Baxter with various remedies that would be material and adverse to us, including without limitation, termination of the Distribution Agreement. Moreover, changes in applicable regulatory requirements could significantly increase the costs of our operations and, if such higher costs result in price increases that exceed the thresholds specified in the Distribution Agreement, could give Baxter the right to terminate the Distribution Agreement and obtain a partial refund of certain fees paid to us pursuant to that agreement.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AS A WHOLE\nWe may not be successful in expanding our product portfolio or in our business development efforts related to in-licensing, acquisitions or other business collaborations. Even if we are able to enter into business development arrangements, they could have a negative impact on our business and our profitability.\nAs part of our business strategy to expand our product portfolio, we are seeking to acquire or in-license other drug products that we believe are a complementary fit with our current product portfolio as well as other products that we believe have substantial development potential. Our experience with respect to these business development activities is limited. The negotiation of such arrangements can be a lengthy and complex process and there can be no assurance that any such negotiations will be completed on a timely basis or on terms that are cost-effective and acceptable to us or, if they are completed, that we will be able to effectively integrate, develop and launch such products effectively.\nIn addition, the market potential for new products is highly uncertain and evaluation of such potential requires significant judgment and assumptions. There is a significant risk that any new product may not be able to be brought to market as profitably as expected or at all. If the results of\nany new product initiative were materially worse than expected, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and condition.\nOur drug and concentrate businesses are highly regulated, resulting in additional expense and risk of noncompliance that can materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur businesses are highly regulated. The testing, manufacture and sale of the products we manufacture directly or through third party contractors are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and by other federal, state and foreign authorities. Before drugs or medical devices, such as our concentrate products, can be commercially marketed in the United States, the FDA must give either approval or 510(k) clearance. Even after a product is approved, regulatory authorities may still impose significant restrictions on a product's indicated uses or marketing or impose requirements for potentially costly post-marketing studies. In addition, our products are subject to ongoing regulatory requirements for labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, sampling, record-keeping and reporting of safety and other post-market information, including both federal and state requirements in the United States and in other jurisdictions where they are marketed. In addition, manufacturers and their facilities are required to comply with extensive FDA requirements, including ensuring that quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to current cGMP and applicable state laws. As such, we and our contract manufacturers are subject to continual review and periodic inspections to assess compliance with cGMP and state laws. Accordingly, we and others with whom we work must continue to expend time, money and effort in all areas to achieve and maintain regulatory compliance. We are also required to report certain adverse reactions and production problems, if any, to the FDA, state agencies and foreign regulatory authorities, when applicable, and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion for our products.\nIf a regulatory agency determines that we do not comply with any applicable regulatory requirements, we may be subject to warnings from, or enforcement action by, state and federal government authorities that may include penalties, fines, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, suspension of production, denial of future regulatory approvals, withdrawal or suspension of existing regulatory approvals, operating restrictions, injunctions and criminal prosecution. If regulatory sanctions are applied, the value of our Company and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe depend on key personnel, the loss of which could harm our ability to operate.\nOur success depends heavily on the efforts of Robert L. Chioini, our founder and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Ajay Gupta, our Chief Scientific Officer, Dr. Raymond D. Pratt, our Chief Medical Officer, and Thomas E. Klema, our Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Treasurer. Mr. Chioini is primarily responsible for the strategic direction of the Company and for managing our sales and marketing efforts. Dr. Gupta is primarily responsible for discovery and development of new technologies. Dr. Pratt is primarily responsible for the clinical development, testing and regulatory approval of our products. None of our executive management have current employment agreements with the Company. If we lose the services of Mr. Chioini, Dr. Gupta, Dr. Pratt or Mr. Klema, our business, product development efforts, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe could be prevented from selling products, forced to pay damages and compelled to defend against litigation if we infringe the rights of a third party.\nOur success, competitive position and future revenues will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products, methods, processes and other technologies, to\npreserve our trade secrets, to prevent third parties from infringing on our proprietary rights and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties.\nWe could incur substantial costs in seeking enforcement of our patent rights against infringement, and we cannot guarantee that such patents will successfully preclude others from using technology that we rely upon. We have no knowledge of any infringement or patent litigation, threatened or filed at this time. It is possible that we may infringe on intellectual property rights of others without being aware of the infringement. If a third party believes that one of our products infringes on the third party's patent, it may sue us even if we have received our own patent protection for the technology. If we infringe the rights of a third party, we could be prevented from selling products, forced to pay damages and compelled to defend against litigation. Moreover, if Baxter is prevented from selling from any of our concentrate or ancillary products due to a patent infringement or if its ability to sell any of our concentrate or ancillary products due to a patent infringement is materially and adversely affected, Baxter may be entitled to terminate our Distribution Agreement and obtain a refund of a portion of the upfront fee and facility fee.\nOur products may have undesirable side effects and our product liability insurance may not be sufficient to protect us from material liability or harm to our business.\nIf concerns are raised regarding the safety of a new drug as a result of undesirable side effects identified during clinical testing, the FDA may decline to approve the drug at the end of the NDA review period or issue a letter requesting additional data or information prior to making a final decision regarding whether or not to approve the drug. Following FDA approval, if we or others later identify previously unknown undesirable side effects caused by our drug or concentrate products, if known side effects are more frequent or severe than in the past, or if we or others detect unexpected safety signals for such products or any products perceived to be similar to such products, the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities may require the addition of unfavorable labeling statements, specific warnings or contraindications, may suspend or withdraw their approval of the product, may require it to be removed from the market or may impose restrictions on the distribution or use of the product. Such side effects may also result in litigation against the Company by private litigants.\nWe maintain products liability insurance in the amount of $5 million per occurrence and $5 million in the aggregate. We cannot be sure that such insurance would be sufficient to protect us against liabilities associated with any of these events in view of our expanding business or that such insurance will remain available at economical levels. We may have significant legal expenses that are not covered by insurance. In addition, our reputation could be damaged by such sanctions or product liability litigation and that could harm our marketing ability. Any such sanctions or litigation could also hurt our ability to retain products liability insurance or make such insurance more expensive. In any such event, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to obtain certain debt financing in the future as a result of our arrangement with Baxter.\nThe Distribution Agreement prohibits us from entering into a contract encumbering the assets used in our concentrate business without the prior written consent of Baxter, and Baxter would be under no obligation to provide us with consent. The assets used in our concentrate business currently constitute a substantial portion of the tangible assets we own. If our development activities require substantial cash resources in the future in excess of our liquid resources on hand and if our cash flows are not sufficient to support financing through unsecured indebtedness, we may not be able to obtain debt financing and our capital financing options may become limited. If we are unable to generate, retain or obtain adequate capital, our business and our future development and expansion strategies may be adversely affected.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nShares eligible for future sale may affect the market price of our common shares.\nAny future sales by us of substantial amounts of our common shares, or the possibility of such sales, could adversely affect the market price of our common shares and also impair our ability to raise capital through an offering of our equity securities in the future. In the future, we may issue additional shares or warrants in connection with investments or for other purposes considered advisable by our Board of Directors. Any substantial sale of our common shares may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common shares and may dilute the economic value and voting rights of existing shareholders.\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2014, there were 4,304,583 shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding and exercisable stock options, 2,580,500 shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options that are not yet exercisable and 733,066 additional shares available for future grant under our 2007 Long Term Incentive Plan. The market price of the common shares may be depressed by the potential exercise of these options. The holders of these options are likely to exercise them when we would otherwise be able to obtain additional capital on more favorable terms than those provided by the options.\nThe market price for our common stock is volatile.\nOur stock price, like the market price of many stocks in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, is volatile. Events such as announcements around clinical testing results or regulatory approval of a product, as well as the reporting of sales, operating results and cash resources, may cause significant fluctuations in our share price. In addition, third parties may engage in trading strategies that result in intentional volatility to and control over our share price.\nWe could have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, which, until remedied, could result in errors in our financial statements requiring restatement of our financial statements. As a result, investors may lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could lead to a decline in our stock price.\nSEC rules require us to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each year, and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in each Annual Report on Form 10-K. It is possible, due to the small size of our accounting staff, that we may identify control deficiencies in the future that constitute one or more material weaknesses. If our internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures are not effective, there may be errors in our financial statements and in our disclosure that could require restatements. Investors may lose confidence in our reported financial information and in our disclosure, which could lead to a decline in our stock price.\nNo system of internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. Over time, controls may become inadequate because changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may occur. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. As a result, we cannot assure you that significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future.\nStructural and anti-takeover provisions reduce the likelihood that you will receive a takeover premium.\nThe Board of Directors has the authority, without shareholder approval, to issue shares of preferred stock having such rights, preferences and privileges as the Board of Directors may determine. Any such issuance of preferred stock could, under certain circumstances, have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control and may adversely affect the rights of holders of common shares, including by decreasing the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to holders of common shares and adversely affect the relative voting power or other rights of the holders of the common shares. In addition, we may become subject to Michigan statutes regulating business combinations which might also hinder or delay a change in control. Anti-takeover provisions that could be included in the preferred stock when issued and the Michigan statutes regulating business combinations can have a depressive effect on the market price of our common shares and can limit shareholders' ability to receive a premium on their shares by discouraging takeover and tender offers.\nOur shareholders do not have the right to cumulative voting in the election of directors. Moreover, our directors serve staggered three-year terms, and directors may not be removed without cause. These provisions could have an anti-takeover effect by making it more difficult to acquire us by means of a tender offer, a proxy contest or otherwise, or to remove incumbent directors. These provisions could delay, deter or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt that a shareholder might consider in his or her best interests, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the common shares.\nWe do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future.\nSince inception, we have not paid any cash dividend on our common shares and do not anticipate paying such dividends in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends is within the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends upon our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and requirements, future prospects, restrictions in future financing agreements, business conditions and other factors deemed relevant by the Board. We intend to retain earnings and any cash resources to finance our operations. Therefore, it is highly unlikely we will pay cash dividends.", "PERMNO": 85744, "SIC": 3842, "TIC": "RMTI"}
