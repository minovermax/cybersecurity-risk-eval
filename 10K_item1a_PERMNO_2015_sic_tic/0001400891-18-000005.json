RISK FACTORS\nChapter 11 Reorganization Risks\nWe filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code on March 14, 2018 and are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with the Chapter 11 Cases.\nFor the duration of our Chapter 11 Cases, our operations, including our ability to execute our business plan, are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with bankruptcy. Risks and uncertainties associated with our Chapter 11 Cases include the following:\n\u2022\nour creditors or other third parties may take actions or make decisions that are inconsistent with and detrimental to the plans we believe to be in the best interests of the Company;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to obtain court approval with respect to certain matters in the Chapter 11 Cases from time to time;\n\u2022\nthe court may not agree with our objections to positions taken by other parties;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to confirm and consummate a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization or may be delayed in doing so;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to obtain and maintain normal credit terms with vendors, strategic partners and service providers;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to continue to invest in our products and services, which could hurt our competitiveness;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to enter into or maintain contracts that are critical to our operations at competitive rates and terms, if at all;\n\u2022\nwe may be exposed to risks associated with third parties seeking and obtaining court approval to (i) terminate or shorten our exclusivity period to propose and confirm a plan of reorganization, (ii) appoint a Chapter 11 trustee or (iii) convert the cases to Chapter 7 liquidation cases; and\n\u2022\nour customers may choose to advertise with our competitors.\nThese risks and uncertainties could affect our business and operations in various ways. For example, negative events, the positions we take in court, or publicity associated with our Chapter 11 Cases could adversely affect our ability to compete for advertising dollars and our relationship with our customers, as well as with our business partners, vendors and employees, which in turn could adversely affect our operations and financial condition, particularly if the Chapter 11 Cases are protracted. Because of the risks and uncertainties associated with our Chapter 11 Cases, the ultimate impact of events that occur during these proceedings will have on our business, financial condition and results of operations cannot be accurately predicted or quantified. If any one or more of these risks materializes, it could affect our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOperating under Chapter 11 may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies.\nUnder Chapter 11, transactions outside the ordinary course of business will be subject to the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court, which may limit our ability to respond in a timely manner to certain events or take advantage of certain opportunities. We must obtain Bankruptcy Court approval to, among other things:\n\u2022\nengage in certain transactions with our vendors;\n\u2022\nbuy or sell assets outside the ordinary course of business;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\ngrant liens; and\n\u2022\nfinance our operations, investments or other capital needs or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest.\nThe Chapter 11 Cases have required and will continue to require a substantial amount of time and attention of our senior management, which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations .\nThe requirements of the Chapter 11 Cases have required and will continue to require a substantial portion of time and attention from our senior management team and leave them with less time to devote to the operations of our business. Our management has spent considerable time participating in the development of restructuring plans and the business plan for the Company. This diversion of management\u2019s attention may have a material adverse effect on the conduct of our business, and, as a result, on our financial condition and results of operations, particularly if the Chapter 11 Cases are protracted.\nWe may experience increased levels of employee attrition as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases.\nAs a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, we may experience increased levels of employee attrition, and our employees likely will face considerable distraction and uncertainty. A loss of key personnel or material erosion of employee morale could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Our ability to engage, motivate and retain key employees or take other measures intended to motivate and incent key employees to remain with us through the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases is limited by restrictions on implementation of incentive programs under the Bankruptcy Code. The loss of services of members of our senior management team could impair our ability to execute our strategy and implement operational initiatives, which would be likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nOur businesses could suffer from a protracted restructuring.\nOur future results are dependent upon the timely and successful filing, confirmation and implementation of a plan of reorganization. If a restructuring is protracted, it could adversely affect our operating results, including our relationships with our advertising customers, business partners and employees. The longer the proceedings related to the Chapter 11 Cases continue, the more likely it is that our advertising customers will lose confidence in our ability to reorganize our businesses successfully and seek to establish alternative commercial relationships. If we experience a protracted reorganization, there is a significant risk that the value of our enterprise would be substantially eroded to the detriment of all stakeholders. In addition, the RSA requires that we achieve various milestones in the Chapter 11 Cases, including that a plan of reorganization be effective by March 14, 2019. If we fail to achieve these milestones, the Consenting Stakeholders may terminate the RSA, which could create considerable uncertainty in the bankruptcy process.\nOur ability to emerge from Chapter 11 and operate profitably thereafter will depend on our ability to obtain exit financing or other capital and to reduce our debt and debt service costs.\nIt is too early in the Chapter 11 process for us to have certainty regarding the terms of our ultimate plan of reorganization. However, for our ultimate plan of reorganization to be effective, we will need to obtain exit financing or capital to fund our emergence costs and support our business following emergence. We cannot presently determine the final terms of such financing, nor can there be any assurances of our success in obtaining it. In addition to pursuing traditional forms of exit financing, we also intend to explore potential merger and acquisition transactions and other investment transactions with financial and strategic investors. Failure to obtain exit financing or other capital may delay our emergence from bankruptcy protection and/or limit our alternatives, which could result in our inability to continue as a going concern. Even if such financing or other capital is available, there is no guarantee that we will be able to implement our business plan and achieve improved financial results.\nOur current cost structure is heavily driven by existing levels of indebtedness. Our plan of reorganization contemplates restructuring, renegotiating, and/or otherwise discharging a substantial portion of our debt. Nevertheless, there is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully achieve sufficient reductions in our debt and debt service costs and other cost savings or otherwise meet our planned continuing obligations. Failure to achieve substantial interest cost reduction and other cost savings upon emergence could materially hamper our ability to operate profitably after emergence, and could result in our inability to continue as a going concern.\nThird parties may propose competing Chapter 11 plans of reorganization and we may receive unsolicited offers for the Company or our assets.\nChapter 11 gives us the exclusive right to file a plan of reorganization during the first 120 days after filing. That period can be extended for cause up to a total of 18 months from the Petition Date with approval of the Bankruptcy Court. While we intend to conclude our Chapter 11 Cases during this so-called \u201cexclusivity period\u201d, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so. Although we filed a plan of reorganization on April 28, 2018, there is no assurance that such plan of reorganization will be approved by the requisite creditors and the Bankruptcy Court. After the expiration of the exclusivity period, third parties can file one or more Chapter 11 plans of reorganization for the Debtors. An alternative plan of reorganization could contemplate the Company continuing as a going concern, the Company being broken up, the Company or its assets being acquired by a third party, the Company being merged with a competitor, or some other proposal. We may not believe that such an alternative plan of reorganization is in our stakeholders\u2019 best interests or fully values the benefits to be achieved by our reorganization. If we cannot successfully obtain approval of our plan of reorganization during the exclusivity period, we may have limited ability to prevent an alternative plan of reorganization from being approved by the Bankruptcy Court.\nCompanies in Chapter 11 are often the target of unsolicited merger and acquisition offers, and there is no guarantee that we will emerge from Chapter 11 as a standalone company. An unsolicited proposal or alternative plan of reorganization could potentially delay our emergence from Chapter 11 and expose us to a number of other risks, including potential limitations on our ability to execute our business plan and strategic initiatives; difficulties in hiring, retaining and motivating key personnel; negative reactions among our employees, vendors, strategic partners and service providers; a failure to provide stakeholders full value for the benefits that could be achieved by the Company post-emergence on a stand-alone basis; and unease and uncertainty among our advertising customer base. In addition, any potential transaction proposed during Chapter 11, even if we decided such transaction was in our best interest, would be expressly subject to Bankruptcy Code requirements and Bankruptcy Court approval.\nWe may not be able to obtain confirmation of a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization.\nTo emerge successfully from Bankruptcy Court protection as a viable entity, we must meet certain statutory requirements with respect to adequacy of disclosure with respect to a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization, solicit and obtain the requisite acceptances of such a plan and fulfill other statutory conditions for confirmation of such a plan, which have not occurred to date. The confirmation process is subject to numerous, unanticipated potential delays, including a delay in the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s commencement of the confirmation hearing regarding our plan.\nEven though the Consenting Stakeholders have agreed pursuant to the RSA to support a plan of reorganization to effect the Restructuring Transactions described therein, we may not receive the requisite acceptances of constituencies in the proceedings related to the Chapter 11 Cases proceedings to confirm a plan. Even if the requisite acceptances of a plan are received, the Bankruptcy Court may not confirm such a plan. The precise requirements and evidentiary showing for confirming a plan, notwithstanding its rejection by one or more impaired classes of claims or equity interests, depends upon a number of factors including, without limitation, the status and seniority of the claims or equity interests in the rejecting class (i.e., secured claims or unsecured claims, subordinated or senior claims).\nIf a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization is not confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, it is unclear whether we would be able to reorganize our business and what, if anything, holders of claims against us would ultimately receive with respect to their claims.\nEven if a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization is consummated, we will continue to face risks.\nEven if a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization is consummated, we will continue to face a number of risks, including certain risks that are beyond our control, such as further deterioration or other changes in economic conditions, changes in our industry and potential revaluing of our assets due to the Chapter 11 Cases. Some of these concerns and effects typically become more acute when a case under the Bankruptcy Code continues for a protracted period without indication of how or when the case may be completed. As a result of these risks and others, there is no guarantee that any plan of reorganization will achieve our stated goals.\nFurthermore, we cannot predict the ultimate amount of all settlement terms for the Debtors\u2019 liabilities that will be subject to a plan of reorganization. Even if our debts are reduced or discharged through a plan of reorganization, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing or other various means to fund our business after the completion of the Chapter 11 process. Adequate funds may not be available when needed or may not be available on favorable terms. Even once a plan of reorganization is implemented, our operating results may be adversely affected by the possible reluctance of advertisers to do business with a company that recently emerged from bankruptcy proceedings.\nAs a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, our historical financial information may be volatile and not be indicative of our future financial performance.\nDuring the Chapter 11 Cases, we expect our financial results to continue to be volatile as asset impairments, asset dispositions, restructuring activities and expenses, contract terminations and rejections, and claims assessments may significantly impact our consolidated financial statements. As a result, our historical financial performance may not be indicative of our future financial performance.\nOur capital structure will likely be significantly altered under any plan confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court. Under fresh-start accounting rules that may apply to us upon the effective date of a plan, our assets and liabilities would be adjusted to fair value, which could have a significant impact on our financial statements. Accordingly, if fresh-start accounting rules apply, our financial condition and results of operations following our emergence from Chapter 11 would not be comparable to the financial condition and results of operations reflected in our historical financial statements. In connection with the Chapter 11 Cases and the development of a plan of reorganization, it is also possible that additional restructuring and related charges may be identified and recorded in future periods. Such charges could be material to our consolidated financial position, liquidity and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to claims that will not be discharged in the Chapter 11 Cases.\nThe Bankruptcy Code provides that the confirmation of a plan of reorganization discharges a debtor from substantially all debts arising prior to confirmation. With few exceptions, all claims that arose prior to the filing of our Chapter 11 Cases (i) will be subject to compromise and/or treatment under the plan of reorganization or (ii) will be discharged in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code and the terms of the plan of reorganization. However, there can be no assurance that the aggregate amount of such claims that are not subject to treatment under the plan of reorganization or that are not discharged will not be material.\nLiquidity Risk\nOur cash flows may not provide sufficient liquidity during the Chapter 11 Cases. Our long-term liquidity requirements and the adequacy of our capital resources are difficult to predict at this time.\nOur ability to fund our operations and our capital expenditures require a significant amount of cash. Our principal sources of liquidity historically have been cash flow from operations, borrowing capacity under the senior secured credit facilities and the receivables based credit facility and issuances of bonds. If our cash flow from operations decreases as a result of lower advertising prices, decreased listener demand, or otherwise, we may not have the ability to expend the capital necessary to improve or maintain our current operations, resulting in decreased revenues over time.\nWe face uncertainty regarding the adequacy of our liquidity and capital resources and have extremely limited, if any, access to additional financing. In addition to the cash requirements necessary to fund ongoing operations, we have incurred significant professional fees and other costs in connection with preparation for the Chapter 11 Cases and expect that we will continue to incur significant professional fees and costs throughout our Chapter 11 Cases. We cannot assure you that cash on hand and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to continue to fund our operations and allow us to satisfy our obligations related to the Chapter 11 Cases until we are able to emerge from our Chapter 11 Cases.\nOur liquidity, including our ability to meet our ongoing operational obligations, is dependent upon, among other things: (i) our ability to comply with the terms and conditions of the cash collateral order entered by the Bankruptcy Court in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, (ii) our ability to maintain adequate cash on hand, (iii) our ability to generate cash flow from operations, (iv) our ability to develop, confirm and consummate a plan of reorganization or other alternative restructuring transaction, and (v) the cost, duration and outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases.\nWe may not have sufficient cash to fund our operations and our emergence costs.\nAs discussed above under \u201cChapter 11 Reorganization Risks,\u201d our cash flows from operations may not provide sufficient liquidity during the Chapter 11 Cases and exit financing or capital may not be sufficient to support our operations post-emergence. Our operating cash flows and exit financing or capital may not be sufficient to pay our debt as it comes due, interest on our debt, emergence costs and other operating expenses. We currently face significantly higher operating expenses due in part to payments to our financial and legal advisors, as well as fees and other amounts payable to the advisors to our lenders and bondholders in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases. Because we have limited short-term sources of cash, we may be unable to successfully emerge from bankruptcy or implement our plan of reorganization.\nThe filing of the Chapter 11 Cases is intended to permit iHeartCommunications to reduce its indebtedness to achieve a manageable capital structure. We are in the process of developing and implementing a plan of reorganization that conforms to the terms set forth in the RSA and meets the standards for confirmation under the Bankruptcy Code. We believe that we will have sufficient cash from operations to fund anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months. Our ability to maintain adequate liquidity through the reorganization process and beyond depends on successful operation of our business, and appropriate management of operating expenses and capital spending. Our anticipated liquidity needs are highly sensitive to changes in each of these and other factors.\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been prepared on a going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The Consolidated Financial Statements do not reflect any adjustments that might result from the outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases. We have significant indebtedness, all of which we have reclassified to current liabilities at December 31, 2017. Our level of indebtedness has adversely impacted and is continuing to adversely impact our financial condition. As a result of our financial condition, the defaults under our debt agreements, and the risks and uncertainties surrounding the Chapter 11 Cases, substantial doubt exists that we will be able to continue as a going concern.\nCCOH\u2019s substantial indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on CCOH\u2019s performance and on our financial condition and liquidity.\nOur subsidiary CCOH has a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2017, CCOH had $5.3 billion of total indebtedness outstanding, including: (1) $2.7 billion aggregate principal amount of CCWH\u2019s senior notes, net of unamortized discounts of $4.2 million, which mature in November 2022; (2) $2.2 billion aggregate principal amount of CCWH\u2019s senior subordinated notes, which mature in March 2020; (3) $379.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of international subsidiary senior notes, net of unamortized premiums of $4.0 million, which mature in December 2020; and (4) $2.4 million of other debt. CCOH\u2019s ability to make scheduled payments on its debt obligations depends on its financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond its control. CCOH may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit it to pay the principal and interest on its indebtedness. CCOH\u2019s operations and its ability to successfully refinance or extend its debt may also be negatively affected by our Chapter 11 Cases.\niHeartCommunications, which is a Debtor in the Chapter 11 Cases, provides the day-to-day cash management services for CCOH\u2019s cash activities and balances in the U.S. pursuant to the Corporate Services Agreement between iHeartCommunications and CCOH, and is continuing to do so during the Chapter 11 Cases pursuant to a cash management order approved by the Bankruptcy Court. CCOH does not have any material committed external sources of capital other than iHeartCommunications. If CCOH has a significant need for capital in the future and iHeartCommunications is limited in its ability to provide such capital, there could be a material adverse effect on CCOH\u2019s financial condition and liquidity, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity.\nOur substantial indebtedness upon emergence from Chapter 11 may adversely affect our financial health and operating flexibility.\nThe terms of the RSA contemplate that upon the effective date of a plan of reorganization, we will have a senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility sufficient to fund the distributions required by the plan of reorganization and $5,750 million in principal amount of secured debt. This substantial amount of indebtedness could have important consequences to us, including:\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy or other purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a substantial portion of these funds to service debt;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including increases in interest rates, particularly given our substantial indebtedness which bears interest at variable rates;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to capitalize on business opportunities and to react to competitive pressures; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability or increasing the costs to refinance indebtedness.\nThe Chapter 11 Cases may give rise to unfavorable tax consequences for us.\nThe consummation of the Chapter 11 Cases may have an adverse tax impact on us. The RSA contemplates the separation of our business from CCOH, with certain senior creditors of iHeartCommunications receiving the approximately 89.5% of CCOH\u2019s outstanding shares of common stock that are currently owned indirectly by iHeartCommunications. It has not yet been determined whether such separation will be structured as a taxable transaction or as a tax-free reorganization. In either case, there is a risk that such separation will give rise to a U.S. federal income tax liability. If such liability were to arise, we would be jointly liable for such tax liability under federal law. iHeartCommunications will be contractually obligated to indemnify CCOH with respect to any such liability. Similar principles may apply for foreign, state and local income tax purposes where we file combined, consolidated or unitary returns with iHeartCommunications or its subsidiaries for federal, foreign, state and local income tax purposes. If an \u201cownership change\u201d (as discussed below) were to occur prior to the conclusion of the Chapter 11 Cases, any tax liability recognized in connection with any transaction, particularly any taxable transaction, could be meaningfully increased.\nIn addition, we expect to be required to significantly reduce certain of our tax attributes, including net operating loss carryforwards, as a result of any cancellation of indebtedness income realized in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases.\nTransfers of our equity and issuances of equity in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases may impair our ability to utilize our federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards in future years.\nUnder federal income tax law, a corporation is generally permitted to deduct from taxable income net operating losses carried forward from prior years. Our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income and to reduce federal income tax liability is subject to certain requirements and restrictions. If we experience an \u201cownership change,\u201d as defined in section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, then our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards may be substantially limited, which could have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations. Generally, there is an \u201cownership change\u201d if one or more shareholders owning 5% or more of a corporation\u2019s common stock have aggregate increases in their ownership of such stock of more than 50 percentage points over the prior three-year period. Following the implementation of a plan of reorganization in the Chapter 11 Cases, it is expected that we will experience an \u201cownership change.\u201d Under section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, absent an application exception, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d the amount of its net operating losses that may be utilized to offset future taxable income generally is subject to an annual limitation on the amount of federal income tax net operating loss carry-forwards existing prior to the change that it could utilize to offset its taxable income in any future taxable year to an amount generally equal to the value of its stock immediately prior to the ownership change multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate, subject to adjustments to reflect the differences between the fair market value of the corporation\u2019s assets and the tax basis in such assets. Because the value of our stock can fluctuate materially, it is possible an ownership change would materially limit our ability to utilize our substantial federal income tax net operating loss carry-forwards in the future. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be able to utilize our federal income tax net operating loss carry-forwards to offset future taxable income, even if any such attributes survive reduction as a result of cancellation of indebtedness income.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nTrading in our securities during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases is highly speculative and poses substantial risks. Although the terms of the RSA contemplate that our existing equity holders will receive 1% of the equity in the reorganized iHeartMedia upon completion of the Chapter 11 Cases, if the plan of reorganization contemplated by the RSA is not confirmed, it is possible our common stock will be cancelled and that holders of such common stock will not receive any distribution with respect to, or be able to recover any portion of, their investments.\nIt is too early to determine if our Chapter 11 plan of reorganization will allow for distributions with respect to our common stock. Although the terms of the RSA contemplate that our existing equity holders will receive 1% of the equity in the reorganized iHeartMedia upon completion of the Chapter 11 Cases, if the plan of reorganization contemplated by the RSA is not confirmed, it is possible that our common stock will be canceled and extinguished upon the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and the holders thereof would not be entitled to receive, and would not receive or retain, any property or interest in property on account of such equity interests. In the event of a cancellation of our common stock, amounts invested by such holders in our outstanding common stock will not be recoverable. Consequently, our currently outstanding common stock would have no value. Trading prices for our common stock are very volatile and may bear little or no relationship to the actual recovery, if any, by the holders of such securities in the Chapter 11 Cases. Accordingly, we urge that extreme caution be exercised with respect to existing and future investments in our equity securities and any of our other securities.\nRisks of trading in an over-the-counter market Pink Sheets.\nShares of our Class A common stock are quoted on the over-the-counter Pink Sheets. The lack of an active market may impair the ability of holders of our Class A common stock to sell their shares of Class A common stock at the time they wish to sell them or at a price that they consider reasonable. The lack of an active market may also reduce the fair market value of the shares of our Class A common stock. Furthermore, because of the limited market and generally low volume of trading in our Class A common stock, the price of our Class A common stock could be more likely to be affected by broad market fluctuations, general market conditions, fluctuations in our operating results, changes in the markets' perception of our business, and announcements made by us, our competitors, parties with whom we have business relationships or third parties with interests in the Chapter 11 Cases.\nIf holders of common stock receive equity in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, that equity will be subject to dilution as a result of future issuances of our common stock.\nWe currently expect that our plan of reorganization will include an equity-based incentive compensation plan for management. The amount and dilutive effect of any issuances under that incentive compensation plan cannot be determined at this time.\nWe may terminate our Exchange Act reporting, if permitted by applicable law.\nIf at any time our Class A common stock is held by fewer than 300 holders of record, we will be permitted to cease to be a reporting company under the Exchange Act to the extent we are not otherwise required to continue to report pursuant to any contractual agreements, including with respect to any of our indebtedness. If we were to cease filing reports under the Exchange Act, the information now available to our stockholders in the annual, quarterly and other reports we currently file with the SEC would not be available to them as a matter of right.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur results have been in the past, and could be in the future, adversely affected by economic uncertainty or deteriorations in economic conditions.\nWe derive revenues from the sale of advertising. Expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns. Periods of a slowing economy or recession, or periods of economic uncertainty, may be accompanied by a decrease in advertising. For example, the global economic downturn that began in 2008 resulted in a decline in advertising and marketing by our customers, which resulted in a decline in advertising revenues across our businesses. This reduction in advertising revenues had an adverse effect on our revenue, profit margins, cash flow and liquidity. Global economic conditions have been slow to recover and remain uncertain. If economic conditions do not continue to improve, economic uncertainty increases or economic conditions deteriorate again, global economic conditions may once again adversely impact our revenue, profit margins, cash flow and liquidity. Furthermore, because a significant portion of our revenue is derived from local advertisers, our ability to generate revenues in specific markets is directly affected by local and regional conditions, and unfavorable regional economic conditions also may adversely impact our results. In addition, even in the absence of a downturn in general economic conditions, an individual business sector or market may experience a downturn, causing it to reduce its advertising expenditures, which also may adversely impact our results.\nWe face intense competition in our iHeartMedia and our outdoor advertising businesses.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry, and we may not be able to maintain or increase our current audience ratings and advertising revenues. Our iHeartMedia and our outdoor advertising businesses compete for audiences and advertising revenues with other radio and outdoor advertising businesses, as well as with other media, such as newspapers, magazines, television, direct mail, portable digital audio players, mobile devices, satellite radio, Internet-based services and live entertainment, within their respective markets. Audience ratings and market shares are subject to change for various reasons, including through consolidation of our competitors through processes such as mergers and acquisitions, which could have the effect of reducing our revenues in a specific market. Our competitors may develop technology, services or advertising media that are equal or superior to those we provide or that achieve greater market acceptance and brand recognition than we achieve. It also is possible that new competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share in any of our business segments. An increased level of competition for advertising dollars may lead to lower advertising rates as we attempt to retain customers or may cause us to lose customers to our competitors who offer lower rates that we are unable or unwilling to match. Our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our ability to achieve a competitive cost structure during the Chapter 11 Cases. If we cannot do so, then our business, financial condition and operating results would be adversely affected.\nAlternative media platforms and technologies may continue to increase competition with our broadcasting operations.\nOur terrestrial radio broadcasting operations face increasing competition from alternative media platforms and technologies, such as broadband wireless, satellite radio, audio broadcasting by cable television systems and Internet-based streaming music services, as well as consumer products, such as portable digital audio players and other mobile devices, smart phones and tablets, gaming consoles, in-home entertainment and enhanced automotive platforms. These technologies and alternative media platforms, including those used by us, compete with our broadcast radio stations for audience share and advertising revenues. We are unable to predict the effect that such technologies and related services and products will have on our broadcasting operations. The capital expenditures necessary to implement these or other technologies could be substantial and we cannot assure you that we will continue to have the resources to acquire new technologies or to introduce new services to compete with other new technologies or services, or that our investments in new technologies or services will provide the desired returns. Other companies employing new technologies or services could more successfully implement such new technologies or services or otherwise increase competition with our businesses.\nOur iHeartMedia business is dependent upon the performance of on-air talent and program hosts.\nWe employ or independently contract with many on-air personalities and hosts of syndicated radio programs with significant loyal audiences in their respective markets. Although we have entered into long-term agreements with some of our key on-air talent and program hosts to protect our interests in those relationships, we can give no assurance that all or any of these persons will remain with us or will retain their audiences. Competition for these individuals is intense and many of these individuals are under no legal obligation to remain with us. Our competitors may choose to extend offers to any of these individuals on terms which we may be unwilling to meet. Furthermore, the popularity and audience loyalty of our key on-air talent and program hosts is highly sensitive to rapidly changing public tastes. A loss of such popularity or audience loyalty is beyond our control and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to attract local and/or national advertisers and on our revenue and/or ratings, and could result in increased expenses.\nOur business is dependent on our management team and other key individuals.\nOur business is dependent upon the performance of our management team and other key individuals. Although we have entered into agreements with some members of our management team and certain other key individuals, we can give no assurance that all or any of our management team and other key individuals will remain with us, or that we won\u2019t continue to make changes to the composition of, and the roles and responsibilities of, our management team. Competition for these individuals is intense and many of our key employees are at-will employees who are under no obligation to remain with us, and may decide to leave for a variety of personal or other reasons beyond our control. If members of our management or key individuals decide to leave us in the future, if we decide to make further changes to the composition of, or the roles and responsibilities of, these individuals, or if we are not successful in attracting, motivating and retaining other key employees, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur financial performance may be adversely affected by many factors beyond our control.\nCertain factors that could adversely affect our financial performance by, among other things, decreasing overall revenues, the numbers of advertising customers, advertising fees or profit margins include:\n\u2022\nunfavorable fluctuations in operating costs, which we may be unwilling or unable to pass through to our customers;\n\u2022\nour inability to successfully adopt or our being late in adopting technological changes and innovations that offer more attractive advertising or listening alternatives than what we offer, which could result in a loss of advertising\ncustomers or lower advertising rates, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial performance;\n\u2022\nthe impact of potential new royalties charged for terrestrial radio broadcasting, which could materially increase our expenses;\n\u2022\nunfavorable shifts in population and other demographics, which may cause us to lose advertising customers as people migrate to markets where we have a smaller presence or which may cause advertisers to be willing to pay less in advertising fees if the general population shifts into a less desirable age or geographical demographic from an advertising perspective;\n\u2022\nadverse political effects and acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts; and\n\u2022\nunfavorable changes in labor conditions, which may impair our ability to operate or require us to spend more to retain and attract key employees.\nIn addition, on June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom (the \"U.K.\") held a referendum in which voters approved an exit of the U.K. from the European Union (the \"E.U.\"), commonly referred to as \"Brexit\". International outdoor is currently headquartered in the U.K. and transacts business in many key European markets. As a result of the referendum, the British government has begun negotiating the terms of the U.K.'s withdrawal from the E.U. It is unclear how these negotiations, or the U.K.\u2019s ultimate exit from the E.U., will impact the economies of the U.K., the E.U. and other countries. This uncertainty may cause our customers to closely monitor their costs and reduce the amount they spend on advertising. Any of these or similar effects of Brexit could adversely impact our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition.\nThe success of our street furniture and transit products businesses is dependent on our obtaining key municipal concessions, which we may not be able to obtain on favorable terms.\nOur street furniture and transit products businesses require us to obtain and renew contracts with municipalities and transit authorities. Many of these contracts, which require us to participate in competitive bidding processes at each renewal, typically have terms ranging up to 15 years and have revenue share, capital expenditure requirements and/or fixed payment components. Competitive bidding processes are complex and sometimes lengthy and substantial costs may be incurred in connection with preparing bids.\nOur competitors, individually or through relationships with third parties, may be able to provide different or greater capabilities or prices or benefits than we can provide. In the past we have not been, and most likely in the future will not be, awarded all of the contracts on which we bid. The success of our business also depends generally on our ability to obtain and renew contracts with private landlords. There can be no assurance that we will win any particular bid, be able to renew existing contracts or be able to replace any revenue lost upon expiration or completion of a contract. Our inability to renew existing contracts may also result in significant expenses from the removal of our displays. Furthermore, if and when we do obtain a contract, we are generally required to incur significant start-up expenses. The costs of bidding on contracts and the start-up costs associated with new contracts we may obtain may significantly reduce our cash flow and liquidity.\nThis competitive bidding process presents a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe expend substantial cost and managerial time and effort to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that we may not win;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to estimate accurately the revenue derived from and the resources and cost structure that will be required to service any contract we win; and\n\u2022\nwe may encounter expenses and delays if our competitors challenge awards of contracts to us in competitive bidding, and any such challenge could result in the resubmission of bids on modified specifications, or in the termination, reduction or modification of the awarded contract.\nOur inability to successfully negotiate, renew or complete these contracts due to third-party or governmental demands and delay and the highly competitive bidding processes for these contracts could affect our ability to offer these products to our clients, or to offer them to our clients at rates that are competitive to other forms of advertising, without adversely affecting our financial results.\nFuture dispositions, acquisitions and other strategic transactions could pose risks.\nWe frequently evaluate strategic opportunities both within and outside our existing lines of business. We expect from time to time to pursue strategic dispositions of certain businesses as well as acquisitions. These dispositions or acquisitions could be material. Dispositions and acquisitions involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\nour dispositions may negatively impact revenues from our national, regional and other sales networks;\n\u2022\nour dispositions may make it difficult to generate cash flows from operations sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements, including our and Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc.'s (\"CCOH\") debt service requirements;\n\u2022\nour acquisitions may prove unprofitable and fail to generate anticipated cash flows:\n\u2022\nto successfully manage our large portfolio of iHeartMedia, outdoor advertising and other businesses, we may need to:\n\u2022\nrecruit additional senior management as we cannot be assured that senior management of acquired businesses will continue to work for us and we cannot be certain that our recruiting efforts will succeed, and\n\u2022\nexpand corporate infrastructure to facilitate the integration of our operations with those of acquired businesses, because failure to do so may cause us to lose the benefits of any expansion that we decide to undertake by leading to disruptions in our ongoing businesses or by distracting our management;\n\u2022\nwe may enter into markets and geographic areas where we have limited or no experience;\n\u2022\nwe may encounter difficulties in the integration of operations and systems; and\n\u2022\nour management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns.\nDispositions and acquisitions of media and entertainment businesses and outdoor advertising businesses may require antitrust review by U.S. federal antitrust agencies and may require review by foreign antitrust agencies under the antitrust laws of foreign jurisdictions. We can give no assurances that the DOJ, the FTC or foreign antitrust agencies will not seek to bar us from disposing of or acquiring media and entertainment businesses or outdoor advertising businesses or impose stringent undertaking on our business as a condition to the completion of an acquisition in any market where we already have a significant position. Further, radio acquisitions are subject to FCC approval. Such transactions must comply with the Communications Act and FCC regulatory requirements and policies, including with respect to the number of broadcast facilities in which a person or entity may have an ownership or attributable interest in a given local market and the level of interest that may be held by a foreign individual or entity. The FCC's media ownership rules remain subject to ongoing agency and court proceedings. Future changes could restrict our ability to dispose of or acquire new radio assets or businesses. In addition, dispositions and acquisitions outside of the ordinary course of business during the Chapter 11 Cases will be subject to Bankruptcy Court approval.\nExtensive current government regulation, and future regulation, may limit our radio broadcasting and other iHeartMedia operations or adversely affect our business and financial results.\nCongress and several federal agencies, including the FCC, extensively regulate the domestic radio industry. For example, the FCC could impact our profitability by imposing large fines on us if, in response to pending or future complaints, it finds that we broadcast indecent programming or committed other violations of FCC regulations. We could face significant fines, for instance, as a result of pending FCC investigations into the allegedly inappropriate broadcast of emergency alert signals by several of our stations. Additionally, we cannot be sure that the FCC will approve renewal of the licenses we must have in order to operate our stations. Nor can we be assured that our licenses will be renewed without conditions and for a full term. The non-renewal, or conditioned renewal, of a substantial number of our FCC licenses could have a materially adverse impact on our operations. Furthermore, possible changes in interference protections, spectrum allocations and other technical rules may negatively affect the operation of our stations. For example, in January 2011, a law was enacted that eliminates certain minimum distance separation requirements between full-power and low-power FM radio stations. In March 2011, the FCC adopted policies which, in certain circumstances, could make it more difficult for radio stations to relocate to increase their population coverage. In October 2015, the FCC proposed rules, which could reduce the degree of interference protection afforded to certain of our AM radio stations that serve wide areas. In addition, Congress, the FCC and other regulatory agencies have considered, and may in the future consider and adopt, new laws, regulations and policies that could, directly or indirectly, have an adverse effect on our business operations and financial performance. For example, Congress may consider and adopt legislation that would impose an obligation upon all U.S. broadcasters to pay performing artists a royalty for the on-air broadcast of their sound recordings (this would be in addition to payments already made by broadcasters to owners of musical work rights, such as songwriters, composers and publishers). Moreover, it is possible that our license fees and negotiating costs associated with obtaining rights to use musical compositions and sound recordings in our programming content could sharply increase as a result of private negotiations, one or more regulatory rate-setting processes, or administrative and court decisions. The CRB has issued a final determination establishing copyright royalty rates for the public performance and ephemeral reproduction of sound recordings by various noninteractive webcasters, including radio broadcasters that simulcast their terrestrial programming online, to apply to the period from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2020 under the webcasting statutory license. The rates set by the CRB represent a decrease from the 2015 CRB rates applicable to broadcasters and other webcasters, but the determination has been appealed. Increased royalty rates could significantly increase our expenses, which could adversely affect our business. Additionally, there are conditions applicable to the webcasting statutory license. Some, but not all, record companies have agreed to waive or provide limited relief from certain of these conditions under certain circumstances. Some of these conditions may be inconsistent with customary radio broadcasting practices. Finally, various regulatory matters relating to our iHeartMedia business are now, or may become, the subject of court litigation, and we cannot predict the outcome of any such litigation or its impact on our business.\nGovernment regulation of outdoor advertising may restrict our outdoor advertising operations.\nU.S. federal, state and local regulations have a significant impact on the outdoor advertising industry and our business. One of the seminal laws is the HBA, which regulates outdoor advertising on controlled roads in the United States. The HBA regulates the size and location of billboards, mandates a state compliance program, requires the development of state standards, promotes the expeditious removal of illegal signs and requires just compensation for takings. Construction, repair, maintenance, lighting, upgrading, height, size, spacing, the location and permitting of billboards and the use of new technologies for changing displays, such as digital displays, are regulated by federal, state and local governments. From time to time, states and municipalities have prohibited or significantly limited the construction of new outdoor advertising structures. Changes in laws and regulations affecting outdoor advertising, or changes in the interpretation of those laws and regulations, at any level of government, including the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate, could have a significant financial impact on us by requiring us to make significant expenditures or otherwise limiting or restricting some of our operations. Due to such regulations, it has become increasingly difficult to develop new outdoor advertising locations.\nFrom time to time, certain state and local governments and third parties have attempted to force the removal of our displays under various state and local laws, including zoning ordinances, permit enforcement and condemnation. Similar risks also arise in certain of our international jurisdictions. Certain zoning ordinances provide for amortization, which is the required removal of legal non-conforming billboards (billboards which conformed with applicable laws and regulations when built, but which do not conform to current laws and regulations) or the commercial advertising placed on such billboards after a period of years. Pursuant to this concept, the governmental body asserts that just compensation is earned by continued operation of the billboard over that period of time. Although amortization is prohibited along all controlled roads, amortization has been upheld along non-controlled roads in limited instances where permitted by state and local law. Other regulations limit our ability to rebuild, replace, repair, maintain and upgrade non-conforming displays. In addition, from time to time third parties or local governments assert that we own or operate displays that either are not properly permitted or otherwise are not in strict compliance with applicable law. If we are increasingly unable to resolve such allegations or obtain acceptable arrangements in circumstances in which our displays are subject to removal, modification or amortization, or if there occurs an increase in such regulations or their enforcement, our operating results could suffer.\nA number of state and local governments have implemented or initiated taxes, fees and registration requirements in an effort to decrease or restrict the number of outdoor signs and/or to raise revenue. From time to time, legislation also has been introduced in international jurisdictions attempting to impose taxes on revenue from outdoor advertising or for the right to use outdoor advertising assets. In addition, a number of jurisdictions have implemented legislation or interpreted existing legislation to restrict or prohibit the installation of digital billboards, and we expect these efforts to continue. The increased imposition of these measures, and our inability to overcome any such measures, could reduce our operating income if those outcomes require removal or restrictions on the use of preexisting displays or limit growth of digital displays. In addition, if we are unable to pass on the cost of these items to our clients, our operating income could be adversely affected.\nInternational regulation of the outdoor advertising industry can vary by municipality, region and country, but generally limits the size, placement, nature and density of out-of-home displays. Other regulations limit the subject matter, animation and language of out-of-home displays. Our failure to comply with these or any future international regulations could have an adverse impact on the effectiveness of our displays or their attractiveness to clients as an advertising medium and may require us to make significant expenditures to ensure compliance and avoid certain penalties or contractual breaches. As a result, we may experience a significant impact on our operations, revenue, international client base and overall financial condition.\nRegulations and consumer concerns regarding privacy and data protection, or any failure to comply with these regulations, could hinder our operations.\nWe collect and utilize demographic and other information, including personally identifiable information, from and about our listeners, consumers, business partners and advertisers as they interact with us. For example: (1) our broadcast radio station websites and our iHeartRadio digital platform collect personal information as users register for our services, fill out their listener profiles, post comments, use our social networking features, participate in polls and contests and sign-up to receive email newsletters; (2) we use tracking technologies, such as \u201ccookies,\u201d to manage and track our listeners\u2019 interactions with us so that we can deliver relevant music content and advertising; and (3) we collect credit card or debit card information from consumers, business partners and advertisers who use our services.\nWe are subject to numerous federal, state and foreign laws and regulations relating to consumer protection, information security, data protection and privacy, among other things. Many of these laws are still evolving, new laws may be enacted and any of these laws could be amended or interpreted in ways that could harm our business. In addition, changes in consumer expectations and demands regarding privacy and data protection could restrict our ability to collect, use, disclose and derive economic value from demographic and other information related to our listeners, consumers, business partners and advertisers,\nor to transfer employee data within the corporate group. Such restrictions could limit our ability to provide customized music content to our listeners, interact directly with our listeners and consumers and offer targeted advertising opportunities to our business partners and advertisers. Although we have implemented and are implementing policies and procedures designed to comply with these laws and regulations, any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our policies or applicable regulatory requirements related to consumer protection, information security, data protection and privacy could result in a loss of confidence in us, damage to our brands, the loss of listeners, consumers, business partners and advertisers, as well as proceedings against us by governmental authorities or others, which could hinder our operations and adversely affect our business.\nIf our security measures are breached, we could lose valuable information, suffer disruptions to our business, and incur expenses and liabilities including damages to our relationships with listeners, consumers, business partners and advertisers.\nAlthough we have implemented physical and electronic security measures that are designed to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of our websites, digital assets and proprietary business information as well as listener, consumer, business partner and advertiser personally identifiable information, no security measures are perfect and impenetrable and we may be unable to anticipate or prevent unauthorized access. A security breach could occur due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, malfeasance or a combination of these or other actions. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, we could lose competitively sensitive business information or suffer disruptions to our business operations, information processes or internal controls. In addition, the public perception of the effectiveness of our security measures or services could be harmed, we could lose listeners, consumers, business partners and advertisers. In the event of a security breach, we could suffer financial exposure in connection with penalties, remediation efforts, investigations and legal proceedings and changes in our security and system protection measures. Currently, not all of our systems are fully compliant with PCI-DSS and GDPR standards and, as a result, we may face additional liability in the event of a security breach involving payment card information.\nRestrictions on outdoor advertising of certain products may restrict the categories of clients that can advertise using our products.\nOut-of-court settlements between the major U.S. tobacco companies and all 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories include a ban on the outdoor advertising of tobacco products. Other products and services may be targeted in the U.S. in the future, including alcohol products. Most European Union countries, among other nations, also have banned outdoor advertisements for tobacco products and regulate alcohol advertising. Regulations vary across the countries in which we conduct business. Any significant reduction in advertising of products due to content-related restrictions could cause a reduction in our direct revenues from such advertisements and an increase in the available space on the existing inventory of billboards in the outdoor advertising industry.\nEnvironmental, health, safety and land use laws and regulations may limit or restrict some of our operations.\nAs the owner or operator of various real properties and facilities, especially in our outdoor advertising operations, we must comply with various foreign, federal, state and local environmental, health, safety and land use laws and regulations. We and our properties are subject to such laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, disposal, emission and release of hazardous and non-hazardous substances and employee health and safety as well as zoning restrictions. Historically, we have not incurred significant expenditures to comply with these laws. However, additional laws which may be passed in the future, or a finding of a violation of or liability under existing laws, could require us to make significant expenditures and otherwise limit or restrict some of our operations.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks because a portion of our revenue is received in foreign currencies and translated to U.S. dollars for reporting purposes.\nWe generate a portion of our revenues in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Changes in economic or political conditions, including Brexit, in any of the foreign countries in which we operate could result in exchange rate movement, new currency or exchange controls or other currency restrictions being imposed. Because we receive a portion of our revenues in currencies from the countries in which we operate, exchange rate fluctuations in any such currency could have an adverse effect on our profitability. A portion of our cash flows are generated in foreign currencies and translated to U.S. dollars for reporting purposes, and certain of the indebtedness held by our international subsidiaries is denominated in U.S. dollars, and, therefore, significant changes in the value of such foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to meet interest and principal payments on our indebtedness.\nGiven the volatility of exchange rates, we cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively manage our currency transaction and/or translation risks. It is possible that volatility in currency exchange rates will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. We expect to experience economic losses and gains and negative and positive impacts on our operating income as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nDoing business in foreign countries exposes us to certain risks not expected to occur when doing business in the United States.\nDoing business in foreign countries carries with it certain risks that are not found when doing business in the United States. These risks could result in losses against which we are not insured. Examples of these risks include:\n\u2022\npotential adverse changes in the diplomatic relations of foreign countries with the United States;\n\u2022\nhostility from local populations;\n\u2022\nthe adverse effect of foreign exchange controls;\n\u2022\ngovernment policies against businesses owned by foreigners;\n\u2022\ninvestment restrictions or requirements;\n\u2022\nexpropriations of property without adequate compensation;\n\u2022\nthe potential instability of foreign governments;\n\u2022\nthe risk of insurrections;\n\u2022\nrisks of renegotiation or modification of existing agreements with governmental authorities;\n\u2022\ndifficulties collecting receivables and otherwise enforcing contracts with governmental agencies and others in some foreign legal systems;\n\u2022\nwithholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax structure and level; and\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations or the interpretation or application of laws or regulations.\nOur International operations involve contracts with, and regulation by, foreign governments. We operate in many parts of the world that experience corruption to some degree. Although we have policies and procedures in place that are designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance (including with respect to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act), our employees, subcontractors and agents could take actions that violate applicable anti-corruption laws or regulations. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nWe identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, and the occurrence of this or any other material weakness could have a material adverse effect on our ability to report accurate financial information in a timely manner.\nOur management recently concluded that, as described under the heading \u201cItem 9A. Controls and Procedures,\u201d we had a material weakness as of December 31, 2017 and therefore did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or effective disclosure controls and procedures, both of which are requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of that date. The material weakness related to our failure to detect the misappropriation of funds by an employee of Clear Media Limited, an indirect, non-wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company whose ordinary shares are listed, but currently suspended from trading, on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. The Company understands that several employees of Clear Media Limited are subject to an ongoing police investigation for misappropriation of funds. Although we concluded that the amount misappropriated was not material to our financial statements, it is possible that the internal controls in place on that date would not have detected a larger misappropriation that would have been material to our financial statements.\nThe misappropriation and the special investigation that we conducted as a result of the misappropriation kept us from filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K on or before its due date. We have implemented additional controls, and are taking additional steps, to remediate the material weakness. However, the remedial measures we have taken may not be adequate to prevent future misappropriation or avoid other control deficiencies or material weaknesses. There can be no assurance that any system of internal control over financial reporting will be successful in preventing all errors or fraud or in making all material information known in a timely manner to the appropriate levels of management. As a result, it is possible that our financial statements will not comply with generally accepted accounting principles, will contain a material misstatement or will not be available on a timely basis, any of which could cause investors to lose confidence in us and lead to, among other things, unanticipated legal, accounting and other expenses, delays in filing required financial disclosures, enforcement actions by government authorities, fines, penalties, the delisting of our common stock and liabilities arising from stockholder litigation.\nSignificant equity investors control us.\nPrivate equity funds sponsored by or co-investors with Bain Capital and THL currently indirectly control us through their ownership of all of our outstanding shares of Class B common stock and Class C common stock, which collectively represent approximately 68% of the voting power of all of our outstanding capital stock. As a result, Bain Capital and THL have the power to elect all but two of our directors, appoint new management and approve any action requiring the approval of the holders of our capital stock, including adopting any amendments to our fourth amended and restated certificate of incorporation, and approving\nmergers or sales of substantially all of our capital stock or assets. The directors elected by Bain Capital and THL will have significant influence over decisions affecting us during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases, subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court, and, to the extent required, the creditors of the Company.\nUncertainties in the interpretation and application of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted comprehensive tax legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\"). The Tax Act requires complex computations not previously required by U.S. tax law. As such, the application of accounting guidance for such items is currently uncertain. Further, compliance with the Tax Act and the accounting for such provisions require preparation and analysis of information not previously required or regularly produced. In addition, the U.S. Department of Treasury has broad authority to issue regulations and interpretative guidance that may significantly impact how we will apply the Tax Act and impact our results of operations in future periods. Accordingly, while we have provided a provisional estimate on the effect of the Tax Act in our accompanying audited financial statements, further regulatory or GAAP accounting guidance for the law, our further analysis on the application of the law, and refinement of our initial estimates and calculations could materially change our current provisional estimates, which could, in turn, materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate. There may also be significant future effects that these tax reforms will have on our financial results and our business strategies. In addition, there is a risk that states or foreign jurisdictions may amend their tax laws in response to these tax reforms, which could have a material impact on our future results.\nCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf. This report contains various forward-looking statements which represent our expectations or beliefs concerning future events, including, without limitation, our future operating and financial performance, our ability to comply with the covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness and the availability of capital and the terms thereof. Statements expressing expectations and projections with respect to future matters are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We caution that these forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties and are subject to many variables which could impact our future performance. These statements are made on the basis of management\u2019s views and assumptions, as of the time the statements are made, regarding future events and performance. There can be no assurance, however, that management\u2019s expectations will necessarily come to pass. Actual future events and performance may differ materially from the expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements. We do not intend, nor do we undertake any duty, to update any forward-looking statements.\nA wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe risks and uncertainties associated with the Chapter 11 Cases;\n\u2022\nour ability to generate sufficient cash from operations to fund our operations;\n\u2022\nour ability to propose and implement a business plan;\n\u2022\nour ability to pursue our business strategies during the Chapter 11 Cases;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases;\n\u2022\nincreased levels of employee attrition as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases;\n\u2022\nthe impact of a protracted restructuring on our business;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain sufficient exit financing to emerge from Chapter 11 and operate successfully;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain confirmation of a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization;\n\u2022\nvolatility of our financial results as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases;\n\u2022\nour inability to predict our long-term liquidity requirements and the adequacy of our capital resources;\n\u2022\nthe availability of cash to maintain our operations and fund our emergence costs;\n\u2022\nour ability to continue as a going concern;\n\u2022\nthe impact of CCOH\u2019s substantial indebtedness;\n\u2022\nthe impact of our substantial indebtedness upon emergence from Chapter 11, including the effect of our leverage on our financial position and earnings;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with weak or uncertain global economic conditions and their impact on the level of expenditures on advertising;\n\u2022\nother general economic and political conditions in the United States and in other countries in which we currently do business, including those resulting from recessions, political events and acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts;\n\u2022\nindustry conditions, including competition;\n\u2022\nincreased competition from alternative media platforms and technologies;\n\u2022\nchanges in labor conditions, including programming, program hosts and management;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in operating costs;\n\u2022\ntechnological changes and innovations;\n\u2022\nshifts in population and other demographics;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain keep municipal concessions for our street furniture and transit products;\n\u2022\nthe impact of future dispositions, acquisitions and other strategic transactions;\n\u2022\nlegislative or regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nregulations and consumer concerns regarding privacy and data protection, and breaches of information security measures;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on outdoor advertising of certain products;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in exchange rates and currency values;\n\u2022\nrisks of doing business in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nthe identification of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting; and\n\u2022\ncertain other factors set forth in our other filings with the SEC.\nThis list of factors that may affect future performance and the accuracy of forward-looking statements is illustrative and is not intended to be exhaustive. Accordingly, all forward-looking statements should be evaluated with the understanding of their inherent uncertainty.", "PERMNO": 24046, "SIC": 4832, "TIC": "IHRT"}
