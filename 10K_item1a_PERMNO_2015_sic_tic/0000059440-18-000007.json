We have described below the known material risks that we and our subsidiaries face. There may be additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we do not currently perceive to be significant that may also impact our business or the business of our subsidiaries. Each of the risks and uncertainties described below could lead to events or circumstances that have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition or equity of us or one or more of our subsidiaries, which in turn could negatively affect the value of our common stock. You should carefully consider and evaluate all of the information included in this report and any subsequent reports that we may file with the Securities and Exchange Commission or make available to the public before investing in any securities issued by us.\nWe have significant liquidity commitments.\nDuring 2018, we have significant liquidity commitments that will require the use of our existing cash resources. As of December 31, 2017, our corporate expenditures (exclusive of Liggett, Vector Tobacco and New Valley) and other potential liquidity requirements over the next 12 months include the following:\n\u2022\ncash interest expense of approximately $106.3 million,\n\u2022\ndividends on our outstanding common shares of approximately $222.9 million, and\n\u2022\nother corporate expenses and taxes.\nIn order to meet the above liquidity requirements as well as other liquidity needs in the normal course of business, we will be required to use cash flows from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents. Should these resources be insufficient to meet the upcoming liquidity needs, we may also be required to liquidate investment securities available for sale and other long-term investments, or, if available, draw on Liggett\u2019s credit facility. While there are actions we can take to reduce our liquidity needs, there can be no assurance that such measures will be successful.\nWe are a holding company and depend on cash payments from our subsidiaries, which are subject to contractual and other restrictions, in order to service our debt and to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe are a holding company and have no operations of our own. We hold our interests in our various businesses through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, VGR Holding LLC and New Valley. In addition to our own cash resources, our ability to pay interest on our debt and to pay dividends on our common stock depends on the ability of VGR Holding and New Valley to make cash available to us. VGR Holding\u2019s ability to pay dividends to us depends primarily on the ability of Liggett and Vector Tobacco, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, to generate cash and make it available to VGR Holding. Liggett\u2019s revolving credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. contains a restricted payments test that limits the ability of Liggett to pay cash dividends to VGR Holding. The ability of Liggett to meet the restricted payments test may be affected by factors beyond its control, including Wells Fargo\u2019s unilateral discretion, if acting in good faith, to modify elements of such test.\nOur receipt of cash payments, as dividends or otherwise, from our subsidiaries is an important source of our liquidity and capital resources. If we do not have sufficient cash resources of our own and do not receive payments from our subsidiaries in an amount sufficient to repay our debts and to pay dividends on our common stock, we must obtain additional funds from other sources. There is a risk that we will not be able to obtain additional funds at all or on terms acceptable to us. Our inability to service these obligations and to continue to pay dividends on our common stock would significantly harm us and the value of our common stock.\nWe and our subsidiaries have a substantial amount of indebtedness.\nWe and our subsidiaries have significant indebtedness and debt service obligations. As of December 31, 2017, we and our subsidiaries had total outstanding indebtedness of $1.4 billion. In addition, subject to the terms of any future agreements, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future. There is a risk that we will not be able to generate sufficient funds to repay our debt. If we cannot service our fixed charges, it would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur high level of debt may adversely affect our ability to satisfy our obligations.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to meet our debt service obligations. A default in our debt obligations, including a breach of any restrictive covenant imposed by the terms of our indebtedness, could result in the acceleration of the affected debt as well as other of our indebtedness. In such a situation, it is unlikely that we would be able to fulfill our obligations under the debt or such other indebtedness or that we would otherwise be able to repay the accelerated indebtedness or make other required payments. Even in the absence of an acceleration of our indebtedness, a default under the terms of our indebtedness could have an adverse impact on our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and on the trading price of our debt and our common stock.\nOur high level of indebtedness, as well as volatility in the capital and credit markets, could have important consequences. For example, they could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our other obligations with respect to our debt, including repurchase obligations upon the occurrence of specified change of control events;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, reducing the amount of our cash flow available for dividends on our common stock and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nrequire us to sell other securities or to sell some or all of our assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, to meet payment obligations;\n\u2022\nrestrict us from making strategic acquisitions, investing in new capital assets or taking advantage of business opportunities;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry; and\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt.\nOur 6.125% senior secured notes due 2025 contain restrictive covenants that limit our operating flexibility.\nThe indenture governing our 6.125% senior secured notes due 2025 contains covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to take specific actions, even if we believe them to be in our best interest, including restrictions on our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock;\n\u2022\npay dividends or distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, capital stock;\n\u2022\ncreate liens with respect to our assets;\n\u2022\nmake investments, loans or advances;\n\u2022\nprepay subordinated indebtedness;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nmerge, consolidate, reorganize or sell our assets.\nIn addition, Liggett\u2019s revolving credit agreement requires us to meet specified financial ratios. These covenants may restrict our ability to expand or fully pursue our business strategies. Our ability to comply with these and other provisions of the indenture governing the senior secured notes and the Liggett revolving credit agreement may be affected by changes in our operating and financial performance, changes in general business and economic conditions, adverse regulatory developments or other events beyond our control. The breach of any of these covenants, including those contained in the indenture governing the senior secured notes and Liggett\u2019s credit agreement, could result in a default under our indebtedness, which could cause those and other obligations to become due and payable. If any of our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not be able to repay it.\nThe indenture governing the senior secured notes contain restrictive covenants, which, among other things, restrict our ability to pay certain dividends or make other restricted payments or enter into transactions with affiliates if our Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the indenture, is less than $75 million for the four quarters prior to such transaction. Our Consolidated EBITDA for the four quarters ended December 31, 2017 exceeded $75 million.\nChanges in respect of the debt ratings of our notes may materially and adversely affect the availability, the cost and the terms and conditions of our debt.\nBoth we and several issues of our notes have been publicly rated by Moody\u2019s Investors Service, Inc., or Moody\u2019s, and Standard & Poor\u2019s Rating Services, or S&P, independent rating agencies. In addition, future debt instruments may be publicly\nrated. These debt ratings may affect our ability to raise debt. Any future downgrading of the notes or our other debt by Moody\u2019s or S&P may affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely affect the value and trading of the notes.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 may increase the after-tax cost of debt financings.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \u201cTax Act\u201d) limits our interest expense deduction to 30% of taxable income before interest, depreciation and amortization from 2018 to 2021 and then taxable income before interest thereafter. The Tax Act permits us to carry forward disallowed interest expense indefinitely. Due to our high degree of leverage, beginning in 2018, a portion of our interest expense in future years may not be deductible, which may increase the after tax cost of any new debt financings as well as the refinancing of our existing debt. We are currently analyzing the impact of the nondeductible interest on our operations and capital structure.\nFailure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect us.\nThe accuracy of our financial reporting depends on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, the implementation of which requires significant management attention. Internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements and may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations. These limitations include, among others, the possibility of human error, inadequacy or circumvention of controls and fraud. If we do not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or design and implement controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of our financial statements, including in connection with controls executed for us by third parties, we might fail to timely detect any misappropriation of corporate assets or inappropriate allocation or use of funds and could be unable to file accurate financial reports on a timely basis. As a result, our reputation, results of operations and stock price could be materially adversely affected.\nLiggett faces intense competition in the domestic tobacco industry.\nLiggett is considerably smaller and has fewer resources than its major competitors, and, as a result, has in certain circumstances a more limited ability to respond to market developments. Further, all of Liggett\u2019s unit volume is generated in the discount segment, which is highly competitive, with consumers having less brand loyalty and placing greater emphasis on price. Management Science Associates\u2019 data indicate that in 2017 Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds, the two largest cigarette manufacturers, controlled 77.5% of the United States cigarette market. Philip Morris is the largest manufacturer in the market, and its profits are derived principally from its sale of premium cigarettes. Philip Morris had 59.1% of the premium segment and 47.1% of the total domestic market during 2017. During 2017, all of Liggett\u2019s sales were in the discount segment, and its share of the total domestic cigarette market was 3.7%. Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds, the two largest cigarette manufacturers, historically, because of their dominant market share, have been able to determine cigarette prices for the various pricing tiers within the industry.\nConsolidation in the industry could adversely affect our ability to compete in the U.S. cigarette market. For example, RJ Reynolds\u2019 merger with Lorillard Tobacco Company in June 2015 could make it more difficult for Liggett and Vector Tobacco to compete for shelf space in retail outlets and could impact price competition in the market, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our sales volume, operating income and cash flows. Further, as part of the merger, RJ Reynolds and Lorillard Tobacco Company divested four of their brands to ITG Brands LLC, which is owned by Imperial Brands Plc.\nLiggett\u2019s business is highly dependent on the discount cigarette segment and to maintain market share, we may be required to take steps to reduce prices.\nAll of Liggett\u2019s unit volume is generated in the discount segment, which is highly competitive, with consumers having less brand loyalty and placing greater emphasis on price. While Philip Morris, RJ Reynolds, and ITG Brands compete with Liggett in the discount segment of the market, the strongest competition for market share has come from a group of smaller manufacturers and importers, most of which sell low quality and deep discount cigarettes. While Liggett\u2019s share of the discount market was 13.5% in 2017, 12.0% in 2016, and 11.8% in 2015, Management Science Associates\u2019 data indicate that the discount market share of these other smaller manufacturers and importers was approximately 27.2% in 2017, 25.6% in 2016, and 24.8% in 2015. If pricing in the discount market continues to be impacted by these smaller manufacturers and importers, margins in Liggett\u2019s only current market segment could be negatively affected and, to maintain market share, Liggett may be required to take steps to reduce prices. Thus, Liggett\u2019s sales volume, operating income and cash flows would be materially adversely affected, which in turn could negatively affect the value of our common stock.\nThe domestic cigarette industry has experienced declining unit sales in recent periods.\nIndustry-wide shipments of cigarettes in the United States have been declining for a number of years, with Management Science Associates\u2019 data indicating that domestic industry-wide shipments decreased by approximately 4.2% in 2017 as compared to 2016, and by approximately 2.4% in 2016 as compared to 2015. In addition to a declining market impacting our sales volume, operating income and cash flows, our annual costs advantage from our exemption under the MSA changes by approximately $1,700 for each percentage decline in estimated shipment volumes in the U.S. market. We believe that industry-wide shipments of cigarettes in the United States will continue to decline as a result of numerous factors. These factors include health considerations, diminishing social acceptance of smoking, and a wide variety of federal, state and local laws limiting smoking in restaurants, bars and other public places, as well as increases in federal and state excise taxes and settlement-related expenses which have contributed to high cigarette price levels in recent years. If this decline in industry-wide shipments continues and Liggett is unable to capture market share from its competitors, or if the industry as a whole is unable to offset the decline in unit sales with price increases, Liggett\u2019s sales volume, operating income and cash flows could be materially adversely affected, which in turn could negatively affect the value of our common stock.\nOur tobacco operations are subject to substantial and increasing legislation, regulation and taxation, which has a negative effect on revenue and profitability.\nTobacco products are subject to substantial federal and state excise taxes in the United States and these taxes may continue to increase. On April 1, 2009, the federal excise tax increased from $0.39 to $1.01 per pack of cigarettes to fund expansion of the State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, referred to as SCHIP. In addition, the April 2009 federal excise tax increase created tax differentials between certain types of tobacco products. This has caused a dramatic increase in the sale of mis-labeled pipe tobacco as a substitute for roll-your-own, which has directly impacted sales of cigarettes.\nIn addition to federal and state excise taxes, certain city and county governments also impose substantial excise taxes on tobacco products. Increased excise taxes are likely to result in declines in overall sales volume and shifts by consumers to less expensive brands.\nA wide variety of federal, state and local laws limiting the advertising, sale and use of cigarettes have proliferated in recent years. For example, many local laws prohibit smoking in restaurants and other public places. Private businesses also have adopted regulations that prohibit or restrict, or are intended to discourage, smoking. Such laws and regulations also are likely to result in a decline in the overall sales volume of cigarettes.\nOver the years, various state and local governments have continued to increase regulation of tobacco products. These regulations include, among other things, disclosure of ingredient information, the imposition of significantly higher taxes, increases in the minimum age to purchase tobacco products, sampling and advertising bans or restrictions, ingredient and constituent disclosure requirements and significant tobacco control media campaigns. Additional state and local legislative and regulatory actions will likely be considered in the future, including, among other things, restrictions on the use of flavorings.\nIn addition to the foregoing, there have been a number of other restrictive regulatory actions from various federal administrative bodies, including the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d). There have also been adverse legislative and political decisions and other unfavorable developments concerning cigarette smoking and the tobacco industry. In 2009, legislation was passed by Congress providing for regulation of cigarettes by the FDA. These developments generally receive widespread media attention. Additionally, a majority of states have passed legislation providing for reduced ignition propensity standards for cigarettes. These developments may negatively affect the perception of potential triers of fact with respect to the tobacco industry, possibly to the detriment of certain pending litigation, and may prompt the commencement of additional similar litigation or legislation. We are not able to evaluate the effect of these developing matters on pending litigation or the possible commencement of additional litigation, but our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nAdditional federal or state regulation relating to the manufacture, sale, distribution, advertising, labeling, or information disclosure of tobacco products could further reduce sales, increase costs and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act may adversely affect our sales and operating profit.\nOn June 22, 2009, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act became law. The law grants FDA broad authority over the manufacture, sale, marketing and packaging of tobacco products, although FDA is prohibited from banning all cigarettes or all smokeless tobacco products. Among other measures, the law (under various deadlines):\n\u2022\nrequires FDA to develop graphic warnings for cigarette packages, and grants FDA authority to require new warnings;\n\u2022\nimposes new restrictions on the sale and distribution of tobacco products, including significant new restrictions on tobacco product advertising and promotion, as well as the use of brand and trade names;\n\u2022\nbans the use of \u201clight,\u201d \u201cmild,\u201d \u201clow\u201d or similar descriptors on tobacco products;\n\u2022\nbans the use of \u201ccharacterizing flavors\u201d in cigarettes other than tobacco or menthol;\n\u2022\ngives FDA the authority to impose tobacco product standards that are appropriate for the protection of the public health (by, for example, requiring reduction or elimination of the use of particular constituents or components, requiring product testing, or addressing other aspects of tobacco product construction, constituents, properties or labeling);\n\u2022\nrequires manufacturers to obtain FDA review and authorization for the marketing of certain new or modified tobacco products, which could ultimately result in FDA prohibiting Liggett from selling certain of its products;\n\u2022\nrequires pre-market approval by FDA for tobacco products represented (through labels, labeling, advertising, or other means) as presenting a lower risk of harm or tobacco-related disease;\n\u2022\nrequires manufacturers to report ingredients and harmful constituents and requires FDA to disclose certain constituent information to the public;\n\u2022\nmandates that manufacturers test and report on ingredients and constituents identified by FDA as requiring such testing to protect the public health, and allows FDA to require the disclosure of testing results to the public;\n\u2022\nrequires manufacturers to submit to FDA certain information regarding the health, toxicological, behavioral or physiological effects of tobacco products;\n\u2022\nprohibits use of tobacco containing a pesticide chemical residue at a level greater than allowed under federal law;\n\u2022\nrequires FDA to establish \u201cgood manufacturing practices\u201d to be followed at tobacco manufacturing facilities;\n\u2022\nrequires tobacco product manufacturers (and certain other entities) to register with FDA;\n\u2022\nauthorizes FDA to require the reduction of nicotine (although it may not require the reduction of nicotine yields of a tobacco product to zero) and the potential reduction or elimination of other constituents, including menthol;\n\u2022\nimposes (and allows FDA to impose) various recordkeeping and reporting requirements on tobacco product manufacturers; and\n\u2022\ngrants FDA the regulatory authority to impose broad additional restrictions.\nIt is likely that the tobacco law could result in a decrease in cigarette sales in the United States, including sales of Liggett\u2019s and Vector Tobacco\u2019s brands. Compliance and related costs are not possible to predict and depend substantially on the future requirements imposed by FDA under the law. Costs, however, could be substantial and could have a material adverse affect on the companies\u2019 financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, FDA has a number of investigatory and enforcement tools available to it. Failure to comply with the law and with FDA regulatory requirements could result in significant financial penalties and could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operation of both Liggett and Vector Tobacco. At present, we are not able to predict whether the law will impact Liggett and Vector Tobacco to a greater degree than other companies in the industry, thus affecting our competitive position.\nLiggett and Vector Tobacco have received requests from FDA regarding certain of their substantial equivalence applications, including \u201cPreliminary Finding\u201d letters and other FDA correspondence requesting additional information that would support FDA\u2019s determinations of substantial equivalence. Liggett and Vector Tobacco have timely responded to FDA\u2019s requests.\nTo date, Liggett has received NSE orders relating to 20 cigarette brand styles. With respect to the first six NSE orders, Liggett discontinued the cigarette brand styles subject to the orders. Sales of these discontinued cigarette brand styles represented less than 1% of the tobacco segment\u2019s annual revenue in 2016. With respect to NSE orders issued in September 2017 relating to 14 cigarette brand styles, Liggett has elected to pursue administrative appeals with FDA. Sales of these 14 cigarette brand styles currently account for approximately 1% of the tobacco segment\u2019s annual revenue in 2017. Liggett is continuing to sell the affected cigarette brand styles during the administrative appeal process. Vector Tobacco received NSE orders relating to three cigarette brand styles in November 2017. Sales of these three cigarette brand styles currently account for approximately 0.5% of the tobacco segment\u2019s annual revenue in 2017. Vector Tobacco elected to pursue administrative appeals with FDA and is continuing to sell the affected cigarette brand styles during the administrative appeal process. There can be no assurance as to the timing or outcome of these appeals and adverse decisions on the appeals could require these cigarettes to be removed from the market.\nWe cannot predict whether FDA will deem Liggett\u2019s and Vector Tobacco\u2019s remaining responses to \u201cPreliminary Finding\u201d letters for pending substantial equivalence applications to be sufficient to support determinations of substantial equivalence for the products covered by these substantial equivalence reports. It is possible that FDA could determine some, or all, of these products are \u201cnot substantially equivalent\u201d to a preexisting tobacco product, as the agency has already done for 20 of Liggett\u2019s applications\nand for three of Vector Tobacco\u2019s applications. NSE orders for other cigarette styles may require us to stop the sale of the applicable cigarettes and could have a material adverse effect on us.\nLitigation will continue to harm the tobacco industry.\nLiggett could be subjected to substantial liabilities and bonding requirements from litigation relating to cigarette products. Adverse judgments could have a negative impact on our ability to operate due to their impact on cash flows. We and our Liggett subsidiary, as well as the entire cigarette industry, continue to be challenged on numerous fronts, particularly with respect to the Engle progeny cases in Florida (described below). New cases continue to be commenced against Liggett and other cigarette manufacturers. As of December 31, 2017, in addition to approximately 80 Engle progeny cases, there were 26 individual product liability lawsuits, three purported class actions and one health care cost recovery action pending in the United States in which Liggett and/or us were named defendants. It is likely that similar legal actions, proceedings and claims will continue to be filed against Liggett. Punitive damages, often in amounts ranging into the billions of dollars, are specifically pled in certain cases, in addition to compensatory and other damages. It is possible that there could be adverse developments in pending cases including the certification of additional class actions. An unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending tobacco-related litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation. In addition, an unfavorable outcome in any tobacco-related litigation could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Liggett could face difficulties in obtaining a bond to stay execution of a judgment pending appeal.\nLiggett Only Cases. There are currently two cases pending where Liggett is the only remaining tobacco company defendant. Cases where Liggett is the only defendant could increase substantially as a result of the Engle progeny cases.\nAs new product liability cases are commenced against Liggett, the costs associated with defending these cases and the risks relating to the inherent unpredictability of litigation continue to increase.\nIndividual tobacco-related cases have increased as a result of the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Engle.\nIn May 2003, a Florida intermediate appellate court overturned a $790.0 million punitive damages award against Liggett and decertified the Engle v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. smoking and health class action. In July 2006, the Florida Supreme Court affirmed in part and reversed in part the May 2003 intermediate appellate court decision. Among other things, the Florida Supreme Court affirmed the decision decertifying the class on a prospective basis and the order vacating the punitive damages award, but preserved several of the trial court\u2019s Phase I findings (including that: (i) smoking causes lung cancer, among other diseases; (ii) nicotine in cigarettes is addictive; (iii) defendants placed cigarettes on the market that were defective and unreasonably dangerous; (iv) the defendants concealed material information; (v) all defendants sold or supplied cigarettes that were defective; and (vi) all defendants were negligent) and allowed plaintiffs to proceed to trial on individual liability issues (using the above findings) and compensatory and punitive damage issues, provided they commence their individual lawsuits within one year of the date the court\u2019s decision became final on January 11, 2007, the date of the court\u2019s mandate. In December 2006, the Florida Supreme Court added the finding that defendants sold or supplied cigarettes that, at the time of sale or supply, did not conform to the representations made by defendants.\nPursuant to the Florida Supreme Court\u2019s July 2006 ruling in Engle, former class members had until January 2008 to file individual lawsuits. Cases were commenced on behalf of approximately 8,000 plaintiffs. Lawsuits by individuals requesting the benefit of the Engle ruling are referred to as the \u201cEngle progeny cases.\u201d Notwithstanding Liggett\u2019s multi-plaintiff settlements, Liggett and Vector remain defendants in approximately 80 state court Engle progeny cases.\nWe cannot predict the cash requirements related to any future settlements and judgments, including cash required to bond any appeals, and there is a risk that those requirements will not be able to be met.\nExcise tax increases adversely affect cigarette sales.\nCigarettes are subject to substantial and increasing federal, state and local excise taxes. In February 2009, Federal legislation to reauthorize SCHIP, which includes funding provisions that increase the federal cigarette excise tax from $0.39 to $1.01 per pack, was enacted, effective April 1, 2009. Additional increases in the federal cigarette excise tax have been periodically proposed by Congress. Various states and other jurisdictions are considering, or have pending, legislation proposing further state excise tax increases. Management believes increases in excise and similar taxes have had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on sales of cigarettes.\nLiggett may have additional payment obligations under the MSA.\nNPM Adjustment. In March 2006, an economic consulting firm selected pursuant to the MSA determined that the MSA was a \u201csignificant factor contributing to\u201d the loss of market share of Participating Manufacturers for 2003. This same determination has been made for additional years. This is known as the \u201cNPM Adjustment.\u201d As a result, the Participating Manufacturers may be entitled to potential NPM Adjustments to their MSA payments.\nThe Participating Manufacturers entered into an agreement with 27 Settling States setting out terms for settlement of the NPM Adjustment for 2003 - 2012 and addressing the NPM Adjustment with respect to those states for future years. New York also settled the dispute.\nFor 2003 - 2016, Liggett and Vector Tobacco, as applicable, disputed that they owed the Settling States the NPM Adjustments as calculated by the independent auditor. As permitted by the MSA, Liggett and Vector Tobacco paid subject to dispute, withheld payment or paid into a disputed payment account the amounts associated with these NPM Adjustments. For those states that did not enter into the agreement, or otherwise settle, the arbitration for 2004 has commenced. It is possible that Liggett could owe additional monies to the non-settling states in connection with the NPM Adjustment dispute.\nLiggett may have additional payment obligations under its individual state settlements.\nIn 2004, the Attorneys General of Mississippi and Texas advised Liggett that they believed Liggett had failed to make all required payments under the respective settlement agreements with these states. Liggett believes these allegations are without merit, based, among other things, on the language of the most favored nation provisions of the settlement agreements. No amounts have been accrued in our consolidated financial statements for any additional amounts that may be payable by Liggett under the settlement agreements with Mississippi and Texas. In January 2016, the Attorney General for Mississippi filed a motion in state Chancery Court in Jackson County, Mississippi to enforce the March 1996 settlement agreement alleging that Liggett owes Mississippi at least $27,000 in damages (including interest), and $20,000 in punitive damages and attorneys\u2019 fees. In April 2017, the court ruled that the settlement agreement should be enforced and referred the matter to a Special Master for further proceedings to determine the amount of damages, if any, to be awarded. In May 2017, Liggett filed a Petition for Interlocutory Appeal to the Mississippi Supreme Court, which was denied. Proceedings before the Special Master have resumed and the parties are engaged in discovery related to the remaining issues. A status conference is scheduled for March 29, 2018 and a scheduling order was entered setting a hearing on damages during the week of July 23, 2018.\nNew Valley is subject to risks relating to the industries in which it operates.\nRisks relating to the real estate industry.\nThe real estate industry is significantly affected by changes in economic and political conditions as well as real estate markets, which could adversely impact returns on our investments, trigger defaults in project financing, cause cancellations of property sales, reduce the value of our properties or investments and could affect our results of operations and liquidity. The real estate industry is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in general and local economic conditions which are beyond our control.\nThese conditions include short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation, fluctuations in debt and equity capital markets, levels of unemployment, consumer confidence and the general economic condition of the United States and the global economy. The real estate market also depends upon the strength of financial institutions, which are sensitive to changes in the general macroeconomic environment. Lack of available credit or lack of confidence in the financial sector could impact the real estate market, which in turn could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny of the following could be associated with cyclicality in the real estate market by halting or limiting a recovery in the residential real estate market, and have an adverse effect on our business by causing periods of lower growth or a decline in the number of home sales and/or property prices which, in turn, could adversely affect our revenue and profitability:\n\u2022\nperiods of economic slowdown or recession;\n\u2022\nrising interest rates;\n\u2022\nthe general availability of mortgage financing;\n\u2022\na negative perception of the market for residential real estate;\n\u2022\ncommission pressure from brokers who discount their commissions;\n\u2022\nan increase in the cost of homeowners\u2019 insurance;\n\u2022\nweak credit markets;\n\u2022\na low level of consumer confidence in the economy and/or the real estate market;\n\u2022\ninstability of financial institutions;\n\u2022\nlegislative, tax or regulatory changes that would adversely impact the real estate market, including but not limited to potential reform relating to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and other government sponsored entities that provide liquidity to\nthe U.S. housing and mortgage markets, and potential limits on, or elimination of, the deductibility of certain mortgage interest expense and property taxes;\n\u2022\nadverse changes in economic and general business conditions in the New York metropolitan area;\n\u2022\na decline in the affordability of homes;\n\u2022\ndeclining demand for real estate;\n\u2022\ndecreasing home ownership rates, declining demand for real estate and changing social attitudes toward home ownership; and/or\n\u2022\nacts of God, such as hurricanes, earthquakes and other natural disasters, or acts or threats of war or terrorism.\nNew Valley is heavily dependent on the performance of the real estate market in the New York metropolitan area. New Valley\u2019s business primarily depends on the performance of the real estate market in the New York metropolitan area. Our real estate brokerage businesses and our investments in real estate developments are largely located in the New York metropolitan area and to a lesser extent in South Florida, Los Angeles, Las Vegas and other markets. Further, as of December 31, 2017, we had investments in or were developing 14 projects in the New York metropolitan area. Douglas Elliman Real Estate\u2019s residential brokerage business primarily depends on volumes of sales transactions and sales prices for residential property in the New York metropolitan area. If volumes of residential property sales transactions in the New York metropolitan area decrease, the aggregate sales commission earned by Douglas Elliman Real Estate on sales transactions is also likely to decline, as the residential real estate market experienced to some degree in 2017. Our business is and may continue to be heavily dependent on the continued growth of the property market in the New York metropolitan area, and any adverse developments in the supply and demand or in property prices in these areas would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe cannot assure that property development and investment activities will continue at past levels or that we will be able to benefit from future growth in the property market in the New York metropolitan area, South Florida, Los Angeles, Las Vegas or the United States. Any adverse developments in national and local economic conditions as measured by such factors as GDP growth, employment levels, job growth, consumer confidence, interest rates and population growth in the New York metropolitan area and the United States, particularly in the regions where our investments and brokerages are located, may reduce demand and depress prices for our properties and services and would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 could negatively impact New Valley\u2019s and Douglas Elliman\u2019s markets. The Tax Act places new limits on mortgage interest deductions as well as state and local income and property tax deductions. The loss of the use of these deductions may encourage residents of states with high income and property taxes and costs of housing to migrate to states with lower tax rates and housing costs. In 2017, approximately 85% of Douglas Elliman\u2019s closed sales occurred in New York, California and Connecticut, and a migration of residents from these markets or a reduction in the attractiveness of these markets as a place to live could adversely impact New Valley\u2019s and Douglas Elliman\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNew Valley is dependent on the attractiveness of New York City as a place to live and invest in and its status as an international center for business and commerce. Through its investments in Douglas Elliman Real Estate and 14 developments in the New York metropolitan area, New Valley is dependent on the attractiveness of New York City as a place to live and invest in. If New York City\u2019s economy stagnates or contracts or if there are significant concerns or uncertainty regarding the strength of New York City\u2019s economy, due to domestic, international or global macroeconomic trends or other factors (including, in particular, any matters which adversely affect New York City\u2019s status as an international center for business and commerce or the economic benefits of New York City\u2019s financial services industry), the New York metropolitan area may become a less attractive place to live, work, study or to own residential property for investment purposes. The attractiveness of New York City may also be negatively affected by other factors, including high residential property sales prices or rents (or a risk or perceived risk of a fall in sales prices in the future), high costs of living, the impact of the Tax Act (discussed above) and negative perceptions surrounding quality of life, safety and security (including the risk or perceived risk of acts of terrorism or protests).\nAny reduction in the attractiveness of New York City as a place to live or a place to invest in residential real estate and any matters which adversely affect New York City\u2019s status as an international center for business and commerce could result in a reduction, by volume and/or by value, in our investment in real estate developments and/or residential property sales transactions in the New York metropolitan area, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks associated with our real estate development business.\nReal estate development is a competitive industry, and competitive conditions may adversely affect our results of operations. The real estate development industry is highly competitive. Real estate developers compete not only for buyers, but also for desirable properties, building materials, labor and capital. We compete with other local, regional, national and international real estate asset managers, investors and property developers, who have significant financial resources and experience. Competitive conditions in the real estate development industry could result in: difficulty in acquiring suitable investments in properties at acceptable prices; increased selling incentives; lower sales volumes and prices; lower profit margins; impairments in the value of our investments in real estate developments and other assets; and increased construction costs, delays in construction and increased carry costs. Development projects are subject to special risks including potential increase in costs, changes in market demand, inability to meet deadlines which may delay the timely completion of projects, reliance on contractors who may be unable to perform and the need to obtain various governmental and third party consents.\nIf the market value of our properties or investments decline, our results of operations could be adversely affected by impairments and write-downs. We acquire land and invest in real estate projects in the ordinary course of our business. There is an inherent risk that the value of our land and investments may decline after purchase, which also may affect the value of existing properties under construction. The valuation of property is inherently subjective and based on the individual characteristics of each property. The market value of our land and investments in real estate projects depends on general and local real estate market conditions. These conditions can change and thereby subject valuations to uncertainty. Moreover, all valuations are made on the basis of assumptions that may not prove to reflect economic or demographic reality. We may have acquired options on or bought and developed land at a cost we will not be able to recover fully or on which we cannot build and sell the property profitably. In addition, our deposits or investments in deposits for building lots controlled under option or similar contracts may be put at risk. If market conditions deteriorate, some of our assets may be subject to impairments and write-down charges which would adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nIf demand for residential or commercial real estate decreases below what was anticipated when we purchased interests in or developed such inventory, profitability may be adversely affected and we may not be able to recover the related costs when selling and building our properties and/or investments. We regularly review the value of our investments and will continue to do so on a periodic basis. Write-downs and impairments in the value of our properties and/or investments may be required, and we may in the future sell properties and/or investments at a loss, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face risks associated with property acquisitions. We may be unable to finance acquisitions or investments on favorable terms or properties may fail to perform as expected. We may underestimate the costs necessary to bring an investment up to standards established for its intended market position. We may also acquire or invest in properties subject to liabilities and with recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities. The Company\u2019s acquisition of real estate investments are subject to several risks including: underestimated operating expenses for a property, possibly making it uneconomical or unprofitable; a property may fail to perform in accordance with expectations, in which case the Company may sustain lower-than-expected income or need to incur additional expenses for the property; and the Company may not be able to sell, dispose or refinance the property at a favorable price or terms, or at all, as the case may be; in addition to any potential loss on a sale, the Company may have no choice but to hold on to the property and continue to incur net operating losses if underperforming for an indefinite period of time, as well as incur continuing tax, environmental and other liabilities. Acquisition agreements will typically contain conditions to closing, including completion of due diligence to our satisfaction or other conditions that are not within our control, which may not be satisfied. Each of these factors could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur success depends on the availability of suitable real estate investments at acceptable prices and having sufficient liquidity to acquire such investments. Our success in investing in real estate depends in part upon the continued availability of suitable real estate assets at acceptable prices. The availability of properties for investment at favorable prices depends on a number of factors outside of our control, including the risk of competitive over-bidding on real estate assets. Should suitable opportunities become less available, the number of properties we develop and invest in would be reduced, which would reduce revenue and profits. In addition, our ability to make investments will depend upon whether we have sufficient liquidity to fund such purchases and investments.\nIf we, or the entities we invest in, are not able to develop and market our real estate developments successfully or within expected timeframes or at projected pricing, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected. Before a property development generates any revenues, material expenditures are incurred to acquire land, obtain development approvals and construct significant portions of project infrastructure, amenities, model offices, showrooms, apartments or homes and sales facilities. It generally takes several years for a real estate development to achieve cumulative positive cash flow. If we, or the entities we invest in, are unable to develop and market our real estate developments successfully or to generate positive cash flows from these operations within expected timeframes, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nBecause certain of our assets are illiquid, we may not be able to sell these assets when appropriate or when desired. Large real estate development like the ones that we retain investments in can be hard to sell, especially if local market conditions are poor. Such illiquidity could limit our ability to diversify our assets promptly in response to changing economic or investment conditions. Additionally, financial difficulties of other property owners resulting in distressed sales could depress real estate values in the markets in which we operate in times of illiquidity. These restrictions reduce our ability to respond to changes in the performance of our assets and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nGuaranty risks; risks of joint ventures. New Valley has a number of real estate-related investments in which other partners hold significant interests. New Valley must seek approval from these other parties for important actions regarding these joint ventures. Since the other parties\u2019 interests may differ from those of New Valley, a deadlock could arise that might impair the ability of the ventures to function. Such a deadlock could significantly harm a venture. If our partners face adverse financial conditions, it may impair their ability to fund capital calls or satisfy their share of any guarantees on project financing. In addition, we are typically obligated to execute guarantees or indemnify our partners for guarantees they may execute in connection with the acquisition or construction financing for our projects. The guarantees that we might be obligated to sign include guarantees for environmental liability at a project, improper acts committed by New Valley (otherwise known as a \u201cbad boy\u201d guaranty), as well as a carry guarantee and completion guarantee for a project. In the event of a default, if a lender were to exercise its rights under these guarantees, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur real estate investments and the real estate market in general could be adversely impacted by changes in the law. Many different laws govern the development of real estate. Changes to laws such as affordable housing, zoning, air rights and others, could adversely impact our real estate projects. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the Treasury Department has recently issued Geographic Targeting Orders that will temporarily require certain United States title insurance companies to identify the natural persons who directly or indirectly beneficially own companies that pay all cash for high-end residential real estate in the Borough of Manhattan in New York City and in Miami-Dade County in Florida. No assurances can be given as to the impact such requirements may have on the continued purchasing of high-end residential properties in Manhattan and Miami-Dade County by such individuals for so long as such requirements are in effect, and no assurances can be given as to the impact such requirements may have in the event they are extended to other markets throughout the country in which New Valley is engaged in high-end residential properties.\nThe real estate developments we invest in may be subject to losses as a result of construction defects. Real estate developers, are subject to construction defect and warranty claims arising in the ordinary course of their business. These claims are common in the real estate development industry and can be costly.\nClaims may be asserted against the real estate developments we invest in for construction defects, personal injury or property damage caused by the developer, general contractor or subcontractors, and if successful these claims may give rise to liability. Subcontractors are independent of the homebuilders that contract with them under normal management practices and the terms of trade contracts and subcontracts within the industry; however, if U.S. or other regulatory agencies or courts reclassify the employees of sub-contractors as employees of real estate developers, real estate developers using subcontractors could be responsible for wage, hour and other employment-related liabilities of their subcontractors.\nIn addition, where the real estate developments in which we invest hire general contractors, unforeseen events such as the bankruptcy of, or an uninsured or under-insured loss claimed against, the general contractor, may sometimes result in the real estate developer becoming responsible for the losses or other obligations of the general contractor. The costs of insuring against construction defect and product liability claims are high, and the amount of coverage offered by insurance companies may be limited. There can be no assurance that this coverage will not be further restricted and become more costly. If the real estate developments in our real estate portfolio are not able to obtain adequate insurance against these claims in the future, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIncreasingly in recent years, individual and class action lawsuits have been filed against real estate developers asserting claims of personal injury and property damage caused by a variety of issues, including faulty materials and the presence of mold in residential dwellings. Furthermore, decreases in home values as a result of general economic conditions may result in an increase in both non-meritorious and meritorious construction defect claims, as well as claims based on marketing and sales practices. Insurance may not cover all of the claims arising from such issues, or such coverage may become prohibitively expensive. If real estate developments in our real estate portfolio are not able to obtain adequate insurance against these claims, they may experience litigation costs and losses that could reduce our revenues from these investments. Even if they are successful in defending such claims, we may incur significant losses.\nOur real estate investments may face substantial damages as a result of existing or future litigation, arbitration or other claims. The real estate developments we invest in are exposed to potentially significant litigation, arbitration proceedings and other claims, including breach of contract, contractual disputes and disputes relating to defective title, property misdescription or construction defects. Class action lawsuits can be costly to defend, and if our assets were to lose any certified class action suit, it could result in substantial liability. With respect to certain general liability exposures, including construction defect and product liability claims, interpretation of underlying current and future trends, assessment of claims and the related liability and reserve estimation process requires us to exercise significant judgment due to the complex nature of these exposures, with each exposure exhibiting unique circumstances. Furthermore, once claims are asserted for construction defects, it is difficult to determine the extent to which the assertion of these claims will expand geographically. As a result, we may suffer losses on our investments which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur investments in real estate are susceptible to adverse weather conditions and natural and man-made disasters. Adverse weather conditions and natural and man-made disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes, storms, earthquakes, floods, droughts, fires, snow, blizzards, as well as terrorist attacks, riots and electrical outages, can have a significant effect on the assets in our real estate portfolio. These adverse conditions can cause physical damage to work in progress and new developments, delays and increased costs in the construction of new developments and disruptions and suspensions of operations, whether caused directly or by disrupting or suspending operations of those upon whom our real estate developments rely in their operations. Such adverse conditions can mutually cause or aggravate each other, and their incidence and severity are unpredictable. If insurance is unavailable to the real estate developments we invest in or is unavailable on acceptable terms, or if insurance is not adequate to cover business interruptions or losses resulting from adverse weather or natural or man-made disasters, the real estate developments we invest in and our results of operations will be adversely affected. In addition, damage to properties in our real estate portfolio caused by adverse weather or a natural or man-made disaster may cause insurance costs for these properties to increase.\nA major health and safety incident relating to our real estate investments could be costly in terms of potential liabilities and reputational damage. Building sites are inherently dangerous, and operating in the real estate development industry poses certain inherent health and safety risks. Due to regulatory requirements, health and safety performance is critical to the success of the real estate investments we invest in. Any failure in health and safety performance may result in penalties for non-compliance with relevant regulatory requirements, and a failure that results in a major or significant health and safety incident is likely to be costly in terms of potential liabilities incurred as a result. Such a failure could generate significant negative publicity and have a corresponding impact on the reputation and relationships of the developer with relevant regulatory agencies or governmental authorities, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our investment and operating results.\nInsurance may not cover some potential losses or may not be obtainable at commercially reasonable rates, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Real estate properties in our real estate portfolio maintain insurance on their properties in amounts and with deductibles that we believe are comparable with what owners of similar properties carry; however, such insurance may not cover some potential losses or may not be obtainable at commercially reasonable rates in the future. There also are certain types of risks (such as war, environmental contamination such as toxic mold, and lease and other contract claims) which are either uninsurable or not economically insurable. Should any uninsured or underinsured loss occur, we could lose our investment in, and anticipated profits and cash flows from, one or more properties.\nThe volatility in the capital and credit markets has increased in recent years. Because the volatility in capital and credit markets may create additional risks in the upcoming months and possibly years, we will continue to perform additional assessments to determine the impact, if any, on our consolidated financial statements. Thus, future impairment charges may occur.\nRisks associated with Douglas Elliman Realty.\nDouglas Elliman Real Estate depends on a strong brand, and any failure to maintain, protect and enhance the Douglas Elliman brand would have an adverse effect on its ability to grow its real estate brokerage business. Douglas Elliman Real Estate has developed a strong brand that we believe has contributed significantly to the success of its business. Maintaining, protecting and enhancing Douglas Elliman Real Estate as a premium real estate brokerage brand is critical to growing its business. If Douglas Elliman Real Estate does not successfully build and maintain a strong brand, its real estate brokerage business could be negatively impacted. Maintaining and enhancing the quality of the Douglas Elliman Real Estate brand may require us to make substantial investments in areas such as marketing, community relations, outreach and employee training. Douglas Elliman Real Estate actively engages in print and online advertisements, targeted promotional mailings and email communications, and engages on a regular basis in public relations and sponsorship activities. There is no assurance that those activities will enhance the brand awareness.\nBrand value can be severely damaged even by isolated incidents, particularly if the incidents receive considerable negative publicity or result in litigation. Some of these incidents may relate to the way Douglas Elliman Real Estate manages its relationship with its agents, our growth strategies or the ordinary course of its business or its brokerage business. Other incidents may arise from events that are or may be beyond its ability to control and may damage its brand, such as actions taken (or not taken) by one or more agents relating to health, safety, welfare or other matters; litigation and claims; failure to maintain high ethical and social\nstandards for all of its operations and activities; failure to comply with local laws and regulations; and illegal activity targeted at Douglas Elliman Real Estate or others. Douglas Elliman Real Estate\u2019s brand value could diminish significantly if any such incidents or other matters erode consumer confidence in it, which may result in a decrease in its total agent count and, ultimately could adversely affect its business and operating results.\nThe real estate brokerage business in the New York metropolitan area, South Florida, Aspen, Colorado and Los Angeles, California is extremely competitive. Douglas Elliman Real Estate competes with other multi-office independent real estate organizations and with franchise real estate organizations competing in local areas. Competition is particularly intense in the densely populated metropolitan areas of New York and South Florida in which it operates. In addition, in the real estate brokerage industry, new participants face minimal barriers to entry into the market. Douglas Elliman Real Estate also competes for the services of qualified licensed agents. The ability of its brokerage offices to retain agents is generally subject to numerous factors, including the sales commissions they receive, advertising support and its perception of brand value.\nDouglas Elliman\u2019s business is concentrated in New York, California and Connecticut and changes in U.S. Tax Laws could impact these markets. The Tax Act places new limits on mortgage interest deductions as well as state and local income and property tax deductions. The loss of the use of these deductions may encourage residents of states with high income and property taxes and costs of housing to migrate to states with lower tax rates and housing costs. In 2017, approximately 85% of Douglas Elliman\u2019s closed sales occurred in New York, California and Connecticut, and a migration of residents from these markets or a reduction in the attractiveness of these markets as a place to live could adversely impact Douglas Elliman\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe financial results of Douglas Elliman Real Estate\u2019s real estate brokerage business is affected directly by the success of its agents. Douglas Elliman Real Estate\u2019s real estate brokerage offices generate revenue in the form of commissions and service fees. Accordingly, its financial results depend upon the operational and financial success of its brokerage offices and its agents.\nInfringement, misappropriation or dilution of Douglas Elliman Real Estate's intellectual property could harm its business. We regard the Douglas Elliman Real Estate trademark portfolio as having significant value and as being an important factor in the marketing of its brand. Douglas Elliman Real Estate believes that this and other intellectual property are valuable assets that are critical to its success. Douglas Elliman Real Estate relies on a combination of protections provided by contracts, as well as copyright, trademark, and other laws, to protect our intellectual property from infringement, misappropriation or dilution. It has registered certain trademarks and service marks and has other trademark and service mark registration applications pending in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Although Douglas Elliman Real Estate monitors its trademark portfolio both internally and through external search agents and imposes an obligation on agents to notify it upon learning of potential infringement, there can be no assurance that it will be able to adequately maintain, enforce and protect its trademarks or other intellectual property rights.\nDouglas Elliman Real Estate is not aware of any challenges to its right to use any of its brand names or trademarks. It is commonly involved in numerous proceedings, generally on a small scale, to enforce its intellectual property and protect its brand. Unauthorized uses or other infringement of its trademarks or service marks, including ones that are currently unknown to us, could diminish the value of its brand and may adversely affect its business. Failure to adequately protect its intellectual property rights could damage its brand and impair its ability to compete effectively. Even where it has effectively secured statutory protection for its trademarks and other intellectual property, its competitors may misappropriate its intellectual property. Defending or enforcing our trademark rights, branding practices and other intellectual property, and seeking an injunction and/or compensation for misappropriation of confidential information, could result in the expenditure of significant resources and divert the attention of management, which in turn may adversely affect our business and operating results.\nMoreover, unauthorized third parties may use Douglas Elliman Real Estate\u2019s intellectual property to trade on the goodwill of its brand, resulting in consumer confusion or dilution. Any reduction of its brand\u2019s goodwill, consumer confusion, or dilution is likely to impact sales, and could adversely affect its business and operating results.\nDouglas Elliman Real Estate relies on traffic to its websites, including its flagship website, elliman.com, directed from search engines. If these websites fail to rank prominently in unpaid search results, traffic to these websites could decline and its business would be adversely affected. Douglas Elliman Real Estate\u2019s success depends in part on its ability to attract users through unpaid Internet search results on search engines. The number of users it attract to its websites, including its flagship website elliman.com, from search engines is due in large part to how and where its websites rank in unpaid search results. These rankings can be affected by a number of factors, many of which are not under our direct control, and they may change frequently. For example, a search engine may change its ranking algorithms, methodologies or design layouts. As a result, links to Douglas Elliman Real Estate\u2019s websites may not be prominent enough to drive traffic to its websites, and we may not know how or otherwise be in a position to influence the results. In some instances, search engine companies may change these rankings in order to promote their own competing services or the services of one or more of its competitors. Its websites have experienced fluctuations in search result rankings in the past, and it anticipates fluctuations in the future. Any reduction in the number of users directed to its websites could adversely affect its real estate brokerage business and results of operations. Further, a failure of Douglas Elliman Real Estate\u2019s websites or website-based technology, either due to malfunction, outside intrusion through hacking or otherwise, could significantly\ndisrupt its business and lead to reduced revenue and reputational damage as Douglas Elliman Real Estate may not be able to effectively scale and adapt its existing technology and network infrastructure to ensure its platforms is accessible.\nPotential new investments we may make are unidentified and may not succeed.\nWe currently hold a significant amount of marketable securities and cash not committed to any specific investments. This subjects a security holder to increased risk and uncertainty because a security holder will not be able to evaluate how this cash will be invested and the economic merits of particular investments. There may be substantial delay in locating suitable investment opportunities. In addition, we may lack relevant management experience in the areas in which we may invest. There is a risk that we will fail in targeting, consummating or effectively integrating or managing any of these investments.\nMaintaining the integrity of our computer systems and protecting confidential information and personal identifying information has become increasingly costly, as cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations.\nGlobal cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts that gain unauthorized access to information technology systems both interally and externally to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the Company and its affiliated agents. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and intellectual property, and personally identifiable information of our tobacco and real estate customers. Additionally, we increasingly rely on third-party data storage providers, including cloud storage solution providers. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information are critical to our operations and with respect to information collected and stored by our third-party service providers, we are reliant upon their security procedures. Our systems and the confidential information on them may also be compromised by employee misconduct or employee error. Our systems and the confidential information on them may also be compromised by employee misconduct or employee error. While we and our third-party service providers have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of internal and external threats and incidents, cybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties, including personally identifiable information) and the disruption of business operations. Our business interruption insurance may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include reputational damage, litigation with third parties, diminution in the value of the services we provide to our customers, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations. Developments in the laws and regulations governing the handling and transmission of personal identifying information in the United States may require us to devote more resources to protecting such information, which could in turn adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend on our key personnel.\nWe depend on the efforts of our executive officers and other key personnel as our named executive officers have been employed by us for an average of 24 years (ranging from 22 years to 26 years) at December 31, 2017. While we believe that we could find replacements for these key personnel, the loss of their services could have a significant adverse effect on our operations.\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nThe trading price of our common stock has ranged between $18.70 and $23.14 per share over the past 52 weeks.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include the following:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022\nthe operating and stock performance of our competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new products or services or significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nthe initiation or outcome of litigation;\n\u2022\nthe failure or significant disruption of our operations from various causes related to our critical information technologies and systems including cybersecurity threats to our data and customer data as well as reputational or financial risks associated with a loss of any such data;\n\u2022\nchanges in interest rates;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, market and political conditions;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel; and\n\u2022\nfuture sales of our equity or convertible securities.\nWe cannot predict the extent, if any, to which future sales of shares of common stock or the availability of shares of common stock for future sale, may depress the trading price of our common stock.\nIn addition, the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and trading volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. Furthermore, stockholders may initiate securities class action lawsuits if the market price of our stock drops significantly, which may cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of our management. These factors, among others, could significantly depress the price of our common stock.\nWe have many potentially dilutive securities outstanding.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had outstanding restricted shares and options granted to employees to purchase approximately 6,638,210 shares of our common stock, with a weighted-average exercise price of $10.43 per share, of which options 3,174,786 shares were exercisable as of December 31, 2017. We also have outstanding convertible notes and debentures maturing in January 2019 and April 2020, which are currently convertible into 27,446,211 shares of our common stock. The issuance of these shares will cause dilution which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The availability for sale of significant quantities of our common stock could adversely affect the prevailing market price of the stock.", "PERMNO": 75233, "SIC": 6531, "TIC": "VGR"}
