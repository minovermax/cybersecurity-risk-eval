Risk Factors\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K and other written reports and oral statements we make from time to time contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. All statements other than statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terms such as \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201ccontinue,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201cpotential,\u201d \u201cpredict,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201cobjective,\u201d \u201cprojection,\u201d \u201cforecast,\u201d \u201cgoal,\u201d \u201cguidance,\u201d \u201coutlook,\u201d \u201ceffort,\u201d \u201ctarget\u201d or the negative of these terms or other comparable terms. However, the absence of these words does not mean that the statements are not forward-looking. These forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by the Company in light of its experience and its perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors it believes are appropriate in the circumstances. These forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to a material difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and the risks discussed in the Company\u2019s other filings with the SEC. All forward-looking statements set forth in this Annual Report are qualified by these cautionary statements and there can be no assurance that the actual results or developments anticipated by the Company will be realized or, even if substantially realized, that they will have the expected consequence to or effects on the Company or its business or operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company\u2019s audited Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Forward-looking statements set forth in this Annual Report speak only as of the date hereof, and we do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances, changes in expectations or the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law.\nEconomic recessions and other factors that reduce freight volumes could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nThe transportation industry historically has experienced cyclical fluctuations in financial results due to economic recession, downturns in business cycles of our customers, increases in prices charged by third-party carriers, interest rate fluctuations and other U.S. and global economic factors beyond our control. The recession beginning in 2008 and continuing throughout 2009 impacted the availability of services from our rail, truck, ocean and air transportation providers and our customers\u2019 demands for our services. Although conditions have improved since 2009, the future pace of recovery and even the\ncontinuation thereof cannot be predicted. During economic downturns, reduced overall demand for transportation services will likely reduce demand for our services and exert downward pressures on rates and margins. In periods of strong economic growth, demand for limited transportation resources can result in increased network congestion and resulting operating inefficiencies. In addition, deterioration in the economic environment subjects our business to various risks that may have a material impact on our operating results and cause us to not reach our long-term growth goals. These risks may include the following:\n\u2022\nA reduction in overall freight volumes in the marketplace reduces our opportunities for growth. In addition, if a downturn in our customers\u2019 business cycles causes a reduction in the volume of freight shipped by those customers, our operating results could be adversely affected.\n\u2022\nSome of our customers may face economic difficulties and may not be able to pay us, and some may go out of business. In addition, some customers may not pay us as quickly as they have in the past, causing our working capital needs to increase.\n\u2022\nA significant number of our transportation providers may go out of business and we may be unable to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services to meet our commitments to our customers.\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to appropriately adjust our expenses to changing market demands. In order to maintain high variability in our business model, it is necessary to adjust staffing levels to changing market demands. In periods of rapid change, it is more difficult to match our staffing level to our business needs. In addition, we have other primarily variable expenses that are fixed for a period of time, and we may not be able to adequately adjust them in a period of rapid change in market demand.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and, if we are unable to adequately address factors that may adversely affect our revenue and costs, our business could suffer.\nCompetition in the transportation services industry is intense. Increased competition may lead to revenue reductions, reduced profit margins, or a loss of market share, any one of which could harm our business. There are many factors that could impair our profitability, including the following:\n\u2022\ncompetition with other transportation services companies, some of which have a broader coverage network, a wider range of services, more fully developed information technology systems and greater capital resources than we do;\n\u2022\nreduction by our competitors of their rates to gain business, especially during times of declining growth rates in the economy, which reductions may limit our ability to maintain or increase rates, maintain our operating margins or maintain significant growth in our business;\n\u2022\na shift in the business of shippers to asset-based trucking companies that also offer brokerage services in order to secure access to those companies\u2019 trucking capacity, particularly in times of tight industry wide capacity;\n\u2022\nsolicitation by shippers of bids from multiple transportation providers for their shipping needs and the resulting depression of freight rates or loss of business to competitors;\n\u2022\nestablishment by our competitors of cooperative relationships to increase their ability to address shipper needs; and\n\u2022\ncompetition, particularly in our intermodal business, with companies affiliated with our key rail transportation providers, which may receive preferential terms and conditions as compared to those available to us.\nWe may not be able to successfully execute our acquisition strategy.\nWe intend to expand substantially through acquisitions to take advantage of market opportunities we perceive in our current markets (transportation and logistics) as well as new markets that we may enter. However, we can provide no assurance that future acquisitions will be completed in the time frame we anticipate, if at all. In addition, we may experience delays in making acquisitions or be unable to make the acquisitions we desire for a number of reasons. Suitable acquisition candidates may not be available at purchase prices that are attractive to us or on terms that are acceptable to us. In pursuing acquisition opportunities, we will compete with other companies, some of which have greater financial and other resources than we do.\nWe are unable to predict the size, timing and number of acquisitions we may complete. In addition, we may incur expenses associated with sourcing, evaluating and negotiating acquisitions (including those that are not completed), and we also may pay fees and expenses associated with obtaining financing for acquisitions and with investment banks and others finding acquisitions for us. Any of these amounts may be substantial, and together with the size, timing and number of acquisitions we pursue, may negatively impact us and cause significant volatility in our financial results.\nAny acquisitions that we undertake could be difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our results of operations.\nAcquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nfailure of the acquired company to achieve anticipated revenues, earnings or cash flows;\n\u2022\nassumption of liabilities that were not disclosed to us or that exceed our estimates;\n\u2022\ninability to negotiate effective indemnification protection from the seller, or inability to collect in the event of an indemnity claim;\n\u2022\nproblems integrating the purchased operations with our own, which could result in substantial costs and delays or other operational, technical or financial problems;\n\u2022\npotential compliance issues with regard to acquired companies that did not have adequate internal controls;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention or other resources from our existing business;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with entering markets, such as rail intermodal, air freight forwarding, ocean cargo, and last-mile logistics and contract logistics, in which we have limited prior experience;\n\u2022\nincreases in working capital and capital expenditure investment to fund the growth of acquired operations;\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired companies; and\n\u2022\nfuture write-offs of intangible and other assets if the acquired operations fail to generate sufficient cash flows.\nWe may not successfully manage our growth.\nWe intend to grow rapidly and substantially, including by expanding our internal resources, making acquisitions and entering into new markets. We may experience difficulties and higher-than-expected expenses in executing this strategy as a result of unfamiliarity with new markets, change in revenue and business models and entering into new geographic areas.\nOur growth will place a significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources. We will need to continually improve existing procedures and controls as well as implement new transaction processing, operational and financial systems, and procedures and controls to expand, train and manage our employee base. Our working capital needs will increase substantially as our operations grow. Failure to manage growth effectively, or obtain necessary working capital, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, stock price and financial condition.\nThe execution of our strategy depends on our ability to raise capital in the future, and our inability to do so could prevent us from achieving our growth objectives.\nWe may in the future be required to raise capital through public or private financing or other arrangements in order to pursue our growth strategy or operate our businesses. Such financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and our failure to raise capital when needed could harm our business or ability to execute our strategy. Further debt financing may involve restrictive covenants and could reduce our profitability. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to grow our business or respond to competitive pressures.\nSales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe anticipate that we will fund future acquisitions or our capital requirements from time to time, in whole or part, through sales or issuances of our common stock or equity-based securities, subject to prevailing market conditions and our financing needs. Future equity financing will dilute the interests of our then-existing stockholders, and future sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or other equity-related securities may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur success is dependent on our Chief Executive Officer and other key personnel.\nOur success depends on the continuing services of our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Bradley S. Jacobs. We believe that Mr. Jacobs possesses valuable knowledge and skills that are crucial to our success and would be very difficult to replicate.\nOver time, our success will depend on attracting and retaining qualified personnel, including our senior management team. Competition for senior management is intense, and we may not be able to retain our management team or attract additional qualified personnel. The loss of a member of senior management would require our remaining senior officers to divert immediate and substantial attention to fulfilling the duties of the departing executive and to seeking a replacement. The inability to adequately fill vacancies in our senior executive positions on a timely basis could negatively affect our ability to implement our business strategy, which could adversely impact our results of operations and prospects.\nOur business will be seriously harmed if we fail to develop, implement, maintain, upgrade, enhance, protect and integrate information technology systems.\nWe rely heavily on our information technology systems to efficiently run our business, and they are a key component of our growth strategy. To keep pace with changing technologies and customer demands, we must correctly interpret and address market trends and enhance the features and functionality of our proprietary technology platform in response to these trends, which may lead to significant ongoing software development costs. We may be unable to accurately determine the needs of our\ncustomers and the trends in the transportation services industry or to design and implement the appropriate features and functionality of our technology platform in a timely and cost-effective manner, which could result in decreased demand for our services and a corresponding decrease in our revenues. Despite testing, external and internal risks, such as malware, insecure coding, \u201cActs of God,\u201d data leakage and human error pose a direct threat to our information technology systems and operations. We may also be subject to cybersecurity attacks and other intentional hacking. Any failure to identify and address such defects or errors or prevent a cyber-attack could result in service interruptions, operational difficulties, loss of revenues or market share, liability to customers or others, diversion of resources, injury to our reputation and increased service and maintenance costs. Addressing such issues could prove to be impossible or very costly and responding to resulting claims or liability could similarly involve substantial cost. We must maintain and enhance the reliability and speed of our information technology systems to remain competitive and effectively handle higher volumes of freight through our network and the various service modes we offer. If our information technology systems are unable to manage additional volume for our operations as our business grows, or if such systems are not suited to manage the various service modes we offer, our service levels and operating efficiency could decline. We expect customers to continue to demand more sophisticated, fully integrated information systems from their transportation providers. If we fail to hire and retain qualified personnel to implement, protect and maintain our information technology systems or if we fail to upgrade our systems to meet our customers\u2019 demands, our business and results of operations could be seriously harmed. This could result in a loss of customers or a decline in the volume of freight we receive from customers.\nWe license an operating system that we are developing into an integrated information technology system for all of our business segments. This new system may not be successful or may not achieve the desired results. We may require additional training or different personnel to successfully implement this system, all of which may result in additional expense, delays in obtaining results or disruptions to our operations. In addition, acquired companies will need to be on-boarded onto this new integrated information technology system, which may cause additional training or licensing cost and disruption. In such event, our revenue, financial results and ability to operate profitably could be negatively impacted. The challenges associated with integration of our acquisitions may increase these risks.\nWe depend on third-parties in the operation of our business.\nIn our freight forwarding and freight brokerage operations, we do not own or control the transportation assets that deliver our customers\u2019 freight, and we do not employ the people directly involved in delivering the freight. In our expedited transportation and freight brokerage businesses (particularly our last mile delivery logistics operations, our over-the-road expedite operations and our intermodal drayage operations), we engage independent contractors who own and operate their own equipment. Accordingly, we are dependent on third-parties to provide truck, rail, ocean, air and other transportation services and to report certain events to us, including delivery information and cargo claims. This reliance could cause delays in reporting certain events, including recognizing revenue and claims. Our inability to maintain positive relationships with independent transportation providers could significantly limit our ability to serve our customers on competitive terms. If we are unable to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services to meet our commitments to our customers or provide our services on competitive terms, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected and our customers could switch to our competitors temporarily or permanently. Many of these risks are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u2022\nequipment shortages in the transportation industry, particularly among contracted truckload carriers and railroads;\n\u2022\ninterruptions in service or stoppages in transportation as a result of labor disputes, seaport strikes, network congestion, weather-related issues, Acts of God, or acts of terrorism;\n\u2022\nchanges in regulations impacting transportation;\n\u2022\nincreases in operating expenses for carriers, such as fuel costs, insurance premiums and licensing expenses, that result in a reduction in available carriers; and\n\u2022\nchanges in transportation rates.\nIncreases in independent contractor driver compensation or other difficulties attracting and retaining qualified independent contractor drivers could adversely affect our profitability and ability to maintain or grow our independent contractor driver fleet.\nOur expedited transportation and intermodal drayage businesses operate through fleets of vehicles that are owned and operated by independent contractors. Our last mile delivery logistics business also operates through a fleet of independent contract carriers that supply their own vehicles, drivers and helpers. These independent contractors are responsible for maintaining and operating their own equipment and paying their own fuel, insurance, licenses and other operating costs. Turnover and bankruptcy among independent contractor drivers often limit the pool of qualified independent contractor drivers and increase competition for their services. In addition, regulations such as the FMCSA Compliance Safety Accountability program may further reduce the pool of qualified independent contractor drivers. Thus, our continued reliance on independent contractor drivers could limit our ability to grow our ground transportation fleet.\nWe are currently experiencing, and expect to continue to experience from time to time in the future, difficulty in attracting and retaining sufficient numbers of qualified independent contractor drivers. Additionally, our agreements with independent contractor drivers are terminable by either party upon short notice and without penalty. Consequently, we regularly need to recruit qualified independent contractor drivers to replace those who have left our fleet. If we are unable to retain our existing independent contractor drivers or recruit new independent contractor drivers, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe compensation we offer our independent contractor drivers is subject to market conditions and we may find it necessary to continue to increase independent contractor drivers\u2019 compensation in future periods, which may be more likely to the extent economic conditions continue to improve. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain a sufficient number of independent contractor drivers, we could be required to increase our mileage rates and accessorial pay or operate with fewer trucks and face difficulty meeting shipper demands, all of which would adversely affect our profitability and ability to maintain our size or to pursue our growth strategy.\nCertain of our businesses rely on owner-operators and contract carriers to conduct their operations, and the status of these parties as independent contractors, rather than employees, is being challenged.\nWe are involved in numerous lawsuits, including purported class action and multi-plaintiff litigations, and state tax and other administrative proceedings that claim that the Company\u2019s contract carriers or owner-operators or their drivers should be treated as our employees, rather than independent contractors. We incur certain costs, including legal fees, in defending the status of these parties as independent contractors. While we believe that our contract carriers and owner-operators and their drivers are properly classified as independent contractors rather than as employees, adverse decisions have been rendered recently in certain cases pending against us, including with respect to class certification of certain contract carriers and determinations that certain of our contract carriers and owner-operators are improperly classified. Certain of these decisions are subject to appeal, but we cannot provide assurance that we will determine to pursue any appeal or that any such appeal will be successful. Adverse final outcomes in these matters could, among other things, entitle certain of our contract carriers and owner-operators and their drivers to reimbursement with respect to certain expenses and to the benefit of wage-and-hour laws and result in employment and withholding tax and benefit liability for us, and could result in changes to the independent contractor status of our contract carriers and owner-operators. Changes to state laws governing the definition of independent contractors could also impact the status of our contract carriers and owner-operators. Adverse final outcomes in these matters or changes to state laws could cause us to change our business model, which could have a material adverse effect on our business strategies, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. These claims involve potentially significant classes that could involve thousands of claimants and, accordingly, significant potential damages and litigation costs, and could lead others to bring similar claims.\nThe independent contractor misclassification matters in which we are currently engaged involve companies that we acquired, including XPO Last Mile and Pacer. Pursuant to the purchase agreements by which we acquired certain private companies, the former owners have agreed to indemnify us for costs and liabilities related to such class action and individual lawsuits, subject to certain limits, and we have retained purchase price holdbacks as security for such indemnification. Other than with respect to acquisitions for which our acquisition accounting process remains open (including, as discussed below, the Pacer acquisition), we believe that we have adequate purchase price holdbacks with respect to the potential impact of loss contingencies involving classification matters that are probable and reasonably estimable. However, such holdbacks may be insufficient to protect us against the full amount of the indemnified liability, in which case we would need to fund any losses from our available liquidity sources. To the extent that we do not have indemnification rights with respect to any such liabilities, or we are unable to collect under any such indemnification agreements, any payments will require utilization of our funds and establishment of reserves.\nWe do not currently expect any of these matters or these matters in the aggregate to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. However, the results of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty and an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters, or our failure to recover, in full or in part, under the indemnity provisions noted above, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nPacer Classification Claims\nOur Pacer subsidiary, which was acquired on March 31, 2014, received notices from the California Labor Commissioner, Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (the \u201cDLSE\u201d), that a total of 153 owner operators contracted with certain Pacer subsidiaries have filed claims with the DLSE in which they assert that they should be classified as employees, as opposed to independent contractors. These claims seek reimbursement for the owner operators\u2019 business expenses, including fuel, tractor maintenance and tractor lease payments. Seven of these claims were heard by a DLSE hearing officer, who awarded a total of $2.2 million to the seven claimants. We appealed these awards to California Superior Court, San Diego, where a de novo trial was held on the merits of those claims. On January 28, 2015, the court issued a tentative statement of decision in which it indicated its intent to find that the seven claimants were employees rather than independent contractors, and to award an\naggregate of $2.0 million to the claimants. Under the court\u2019s tentative statement of decision, either the claimants or we may file objections or comments by February 17, 2015, after which the court will render its final decision. The court\u2019s final decision is subject to appeal, but we cannot provide assurance that we will determine to pursue an appeal or that an appeal will be successful. The remaining DLSE claims have been transferred to California Superior Court in three separate actions involving 175 claimants. These matters are in the initial procedural stages.\nPacer also is a party to a putative class action litigation brought by Edwin Molina in the U.S. District Court, Southern District of California. Mr. Molina asserts that he should be classified as an employee, as opposed to an independent contractor, and seeks damages for alleged violation of various California wage and hour laws.\nThe plaintiff seeks to have the litigation certified as a class action involving all owner-operators contracted with Pacer Cartage at any time from August 2009 to the present, which could involve as many as 600 claimants. Certain of these potential claimants also may have claims under the actions pending in California Superior Court as described above. This matter is in the initial stages of discovery and the court has not yet determined whether to certify the matter as a class action. We have reached a tentative agreement to settle this litigation with the claimants, subject to court approval and acceptance by a minimum percentage of members of the purported class. We cannot assure you that the settlement agreement will be finalized and executed, that the court will approve any such settlement agreement or that it will be accepted by the requisite members of the purported class.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2014, in connection with our Pacer acquisition accounting process, we established a reserve for the estimated probable loss with respect to certain of the cases described above, as required pursuant to applicable accounting standards. This amount was not material to our total liabilities or goodwill. We continue to evaluate these and other claims in light of the recent adverse decisions and other factors. We believe there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred in excess of the reserve amount; however, we cannot estimate the possible loss or range of such possible losses at this time. We cannot assure you that the amount of any actual loss we incur in connection with these matters will not materially exceed any reserve that we establish.\nWe are involved in several lawsuits and are subject to various claims that could result in significant expenditures and impact our operations.\nThe nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various types of claims and litigation. In addition to the matters described in the risk factor \u201cCertain of our businesses rely on owner-operators and contract carriers to conduct their operations, and the status of these parties as independent contractors, rather than employees, is being challenged,\u201d we are subject to claims and litigation related to labor and employment, personal injury, traffic accidents, cargo and other property damage, business practices, environmental liability and other matters, including with respect to claims asserted under various theories of agency and employer liability notwithstanding our independent contractor relationships with our transportation providers. Claims against us may exceed the amount of insurance coverage, or may not be covered by insurance at all. Businesses that we acquire also increase our exposure to litigation. A material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents, liability claims, or workers\u2019 compensation claims, or unfavorable resolutions of claims, or our failure to recover, in full or in part, under indemnity provisions with transportation providers could materially and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, significant increases in insurance costs or the inability to purchase insurance as a result of these claims could reduce our profitability.\nChanges in our relationships with our significant customers, including the loss or reduction in business from one or more of them, could have an adverse impact on us.\nNo single customer accounts for 10% or more of our consolidated revenue. We do not believe the loss of any single customer would materially impair our overall financial condition or results of operations; however, collectively, some of these large customers might account for a relatively significant portion of the growth in revenue and margins in a particular quarter or year. Our contractual relationships with customers generally are terminable at will by the customers on short notice and do not require the customer to provide any minimum commitment. Our customers could choose to divert all or a portion of their business with us to one of our competitors, demand rate reductions for our services, require us to assume greater liability that increases our costs, or develop their own logistics capabilities. Failure to retain our existing customers or enter into relationships with new customers could materially impact the growth in our business and the ability to meet our current and long-term financial forecasts.\nOur intermodal business may be affected by any adverse change to relationships with railroad service providers upon the expiration or renewal of such contracts.\nThe rail contracts supporting our intermodal operations, which have varied expiration dates, contain specific contract rates and other negotiated provisions that enable us to provide competitive transportation rates and services to our customers. A loss of one or more of these rail contracts, or failure to enter into renewal or replacement contracts with comparably favorable terms upon expiration of the current contracts, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nWhile we expect to be able to continue to obtain competitive terms and conditions from our railroad vendors, no assurance can be given that such terms and conditions will be comparable to those in our current rail contracts.\nIn addition, Union Pacific is the primary supplier and servicer of the 53-foot containers used in our business, as well as the chassis used on the Union Pacific network. We have the ability under our arrangements with Union Pacific to increase or decrease our equipment fleet periodically. The refusal or failure of Union Pacific to provide us with additional containers and chassis when required, or to allow us to return excess equipment when requested, or our failure to adequately and timely service the containers or chassis we use, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur cross-border agreement with Union Pacific contemplates a transition in our business model for the cross-border US-Mexico automotive business, which may adversely affect our operating income over time.\nUnder a multi-year agreement entered into with Union Pacific in October 2012 (the \u201c2012 UP Agreement\u201d), we act as Union Pacific\u2019s network logistics manager for cross-border shipments and provide rail container and chassis management services on a wholesale basis for Union Pacific in Mexico. We are compensated on a fee basis for such services and the use of our equipment. Revenues and margins from the US-Mexico wholesale intermodal automotive business are primarily dependent on (1) the volume of US-Mexico automotive parts shipments via the network that we manage under the 2012 UP Agreement; (2) the volume of our equipment used via the network that we manage versus rail or other equipment; and (3) the amount of sales, general and administrative costs we incur to run this business. The 2012 UP Agreement provides for the step-down, and ultimately the termination as of December 31, 2015, of our role in the US-Mexico wholesale intermodal automotive business, and contemplates that our business model with respect to US-Mexico automotive business will transition to a direct retail model. Accordingly, our revenue and margin for the services and equipment we provide under the 2012 UP Agreement will decline unless we are successful in increasing our direct retail US-Mexico automotive business. We have limited experience operating a retail model in these lanes and can provide no assurance that we will generate sufficient retail business to replace the wholesale intermodal cross-border automotive business. If there are unfavorable changes in any of the aforementioned factors, or if we are unsuccessful in replacing the wholesale business with new direct retail US-Mexico automotive business, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected and may result in a material goodwill impairment.\nNetwork changes, lane closures, carrier consolidation, and other reductions or deterioration in rail services could increase costs, decrease demand for our intermodal services and adversely affect our operating results.\nMost of the intermodal transportation services that we provide depend on the major railroads in the United States and Mexico, which in many markets is limited to a few railroads or even a single railroad. As a result, any reduction, suspension, interruption or elimination of rail service to a particular market may limit our ability to serve some of our customers. Furthermore, reductions in service by the railroads are likely to increase the cost of the rail-based services that we provide and potentially reduce the reliability, timeliness, and overall attractiveness of our intermodal product. Increases in the cost of rail service reduce some of the advantages of intermodal transportation compared to truck and other transportation modes, which may reduce demand for our intermodal services. Rail consolidations in the past have caused service disruptions and would further reduce service choices and bargaining power for rail customers. Further consolidation among railroads might adversely affect intermodal transportation and our results of operations.\nFrom time to time, our railroad suppliers have experienced train resource shortages, operating inefficiencies, and high demand for rail transportation that resulted in increased transit times, terminal congestion, and decreased equipment velocity, all of which increase our costs, decrease equipment capacity, impact customer service, and create a challenging operating environment. To the extent that we rely on rail carriers that experience poor service performance, demand for our intermodal services may be adversely affected.\nOur business may be materially adversely affected by labor disputes, including those currently affecting West Coast seaports.\nOur business in the past has been and in the future could be adversely affected by strikes and labor renegotiations affecting seaports, labor disputes between railroads and their union employees, or by a work stoppage at one or more railroads or local trucking companies servicing rail or port terminals, including work disruptions involving owner operators under contract with our local trucking operations. Currently, due to ongoing work slowdowns by the longshore workers union, port operators have closed West Coast ports for six days (generally weekends and holidays) in February 2015. Our local drayage operations, other intermodal lines of business, and our NVOCC and international freight forwarding operations have been adversely impacted by recent West Coast port congestion and shutdowns. We cannot predict when these labor issues and shutdowns affecting West Coast ports will be resolved. These recent port shutdowns and similar disruptions to major points in the transportation network, most of which are beyond our control, result in terminal embargoes, disrupt equipment and freight flows, depress volumes and revenues, increase costs and have other negative effects on our operations and financial results.\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition.\nAs of February 20, 2015, we had approximately $1.0 billion of total indebtedness and unused commitments of $415 million under our Amended Credit Agreement (less $14 million of outstanding letters of credit), the availability of which is subject to certain conditions including its borrowing base availability. We incurred this substantial indebtedness in connection with the New Breed acquisition, for general corporate purposes and in anticipation of executing our acquisition strategy. We currently have cash and cash equivalents of $1.1 billion, which results in us currently having a negative net debt position. However, in the event that we complete acquisitions in the future that decrease our cash position, we would have substantial outstanding indebtedness. Our debt level could:\n\u2022\nnegatively affect our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt or dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to fund future capital expenditures and working capital, to engage in future acquisitions or development activities, or to otherwise realize the value of our assets and opportunities fully because of the need to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments of interest and principal or to comply with any restrictive terms of our debt;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which it operates;\n\u2022\nimpair our ability to obtain additional financing or to refinance our indebtedness in the future; and\n\u2022\nplace the Company at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that may have proportionately less debt.\nOur inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, could materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. Further, failure to comply with the covenants under our indebtedness may have a material adverse impact on our operations. If we fail to comply with the covenants under any of our indebtedness, and are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment, such failure may result in an event of default under our indebtedness. We cannot assure you that we would have sufficient liquidity to repay or refinance our indebtedness if such indebtedness were accelerated upon an event of default.\nUnder the terms of our outstanding indebtedness, we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, which could further exacerbate the risks described above.\nFluctuations in the price or availability of fuel may change our operations structure and resulting profitability.\nFuel expense constitutes one of the greatest costs to our fleet of independent contractor drivers and third-party transportation providers who complete the physical movement of freight we arrange. Fuel prices are highly volatile with the price and availability of all petroleum products subject to economic, political and other market forces beyond our control. As is customary in our industry, most of our customer contracts include fuel surcharge provisions to mitigate the effect of the fuel price increase over base amounts established in the contract. However, these fuel surcharge mechanisms usually do not capture the entire amount of the increase in fuel prices, and they also feature a lag between the payment for fuel and collection of the surcharge revenue. Market pressures may limit our ability to assess fuel surcharges in the future. Significant increases in fuel prices would increase our need for working capital to fund payments to our independent contractor drivers and third-party transportation providers. Decreases in fuel prices reduce the cost of transportation services and accordingly, will reduce our revenues and may reduce margins for certain significant lines of business. Significant changes in the price or availability of fuel in future periods, or significant changes in our ability to mitigate fuel price increases through the use of fuel surcharges, could have a material adverse impact on our operations, fleet capacity and ability to generate both revenues and profits.\nWe are subject to changes in markets and our business plans that have resulted, and may in the future result, in write-downs of the carrying value of our assets, potentially in significant amounts, thereby reducing our net income.\nOur regular review of the carrying value of our assets has resulted, from time to time, in impairments, and we may in the future be required to recognize additional impairment charges, potentially in significant amounts. Changes in business strategy, rebranding efforts, government regulations, economic or market conditions, or our operating performance have resulted and may result in further substantial impairments of intangible, fixed or other assets at any time in the future, including with respect to our acquired businesses. While such impairment charges would not impact our cash position, such charges could significant reduce our net income.\nEvents affecting customer manufacturing plants, such as labor disputes or plant closures, could have a material effect on our performance.\nOur Logistics segment derives a substantial portion of revenue from the operation and management of operating facilities, which are often located in close proximity to a client\u2019s manufacturing plant and are integrated into the client\u2019s production line process. We may experience significant revenue loss and shut-down costs, including costs related to early termination of leases, causing our business to suffer if clients suffer strikes or other labor disputes, close their plants or significantly modify their capacity or supply chains at a plant that our Logistics segment services. In such a situation, our operations may be unable to recoup all or any of the related costs that we have incurred. Similarly, a labor dispute or plant closure involving a supplier to our Logistics segment\u2019s clients that results in a slowdown or closure of our clients\u2019 plants could also have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur warehouse lease costs are fixed for a certain period of time, even if customer demand for shipping services in the areas where these warehouses are located decreases.\nWe lease the warehouses in which we operate pursuant to operating leases of various durations. These leases provide for rent and other expenses that are essentially fixed in nature for a period of time, which may limit our ability to react promptly to a decline in demand by our customers for shipping services in the areas where our warehouses are located. Our inability to respond promptly to changes in customer demand may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may be unable to terminate these leases or find suitable subtenants in the event of a rapid reduction in market demand without a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nA majority of our Logistics segment\u2019s business (through our September 2014 acquisition of New Breed) revenues are generated on a per unit basis. If the amount or level of services that New Breed performs is reduced, it would have a direct negative impact on our results of operations.\nThe clients of our Logistics segment operations may materially reduce or eliminate a portion of the work that we have historically provided to them because our contracts generally do not have minimum volume or purchase obligations or requirements. Moreover, many of our Logistics segment contracts are subject to competitive bidding. Revenue in our Logistics segment would materially decline if any of our clients\u2019 businesses decline or if a client cancels a significant project or a significant number of projects, and our Logistics segment operations is unable to replace them with similar projects. However, our Logistics operations\u2019 contracts have cancellation provisions that typically require the client to pay a termination fee if the client terminates the contract without cause. Under most of our Logistics segment\u2019s contractual arrangements with our clients, all or a portion of our pricing is based on certain assumptions regarding the scope of services, production or order volumes, operational efficiencies, the mix of fixed versus variable costs, productivity and other factors. If these assumptions prove to be invalid or, as a result of subsequent changes in our Logistics segment\u2019s client\u2019s business needs or market forces that are outside of our control, these assumptions are rendered obsolete, our Logistics segment operations would likely have lower margins than anticipated, or our Logistics segment\u2019s contracts could prove unprofitable. In such events, there is no assurance that our Logistics segment operations will be successful in obtaining the price adjustments necessary to maintain our revenues.\nA relatively small modification to the manner in which our Logistics segment\u2019s clients do business could have a large effect on the services we provide and could materially increase our costs.\nThe nature of our Logistics segment\u2019s operations requires us to align the services that we provide with the policies and practices of our clients. A minor change in such policies and practices may have a material impact on our Logistics segment\u2019s operations. A minor modification to, for example, the terms of the return policy of one of our clients could require our operations to modify the service model that we have developed for such client. This could require our Logistics segment\u2019s operations to, without limitation, hire additional labor, develop new technology, open additional facilities, adopt more stringent standards or otherwise incur additional costs. Such special arrangements may be expensive, and we may not be able to recoup the additional costs posed by the necessary modifications to its service model. In certain cases, changes to our Logistics segment\u2019s clients\u2019 policies and practices could reduce their need for our services generally. If our Logistics segment is unable to successfully address the service requirements of our existing and future clients, or if our clients\u2019 need for its services is reduced, our business and prospects will be materially and adversely affected.\nOur Logistics segment\u2019s business (through our September 2014 acquisition of New Breed) typically faces a long selling cycle to secure a new engagement and a long implementation period that require a significant commitment of resources, before we can recognize revenue.\nOur Logistics segment, which is the New Breed business we acquired in September 2014, typically faces a long selling cycle to secure a new client engagement, during which period it incurs significant costs and devotes substantial management time. Our operations may not succeed in winning the new business, in which case it would not receive any revenue or reimbursement for such expenses.\nEven if our Logistics segment is successful in obtaining a new engagement, that is often followed by an implementation period in which the services are planned in detail, necessary resources are deployed and workers are hired. During this time a binding contract is also negotiated and agreed. Until our Logistics segment signs a binding contract for the engagement, the client may still change its mind and decide to retain the work in-house or choose a competitor. Our clients may also experience delays in obtaining internal approvals or delays associated with technology or system implementations, further lengthening the implementation cycle.\nThe long selling cycle and implementation phase for its services and the limited number of new engagements it pursues at any time make it difficult for us to predict with any accuracy the timing of revenues from new engagements as well as our related costs.\nIssues related to the intellectual property rights on which our business depends, whether related to our failure to enforce our own rights or infringement claims brought by others, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe use both internally developed and purchased technology in conducting our business. Whether internally developed or purchased, it is possible that the user of these technologies could be claimed to infringe upon or violate the intellectual property rights of third parties. In the event that a claim is made against us by a third party for the infringement of intellectual property rights, any settlement or adverse judgment against us either in the form of increased costs of licensing or a cease and desist order in using the technology could have an adverse effect on us and our results of operation.\nWe also rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including copyrights, trademarks, domain names, trade secrets, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights, to establish and protect our intellectual property and technology. Any of our owned or licensed intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated; our trade secrets and other confidential information could be disclosed in an unauthorized manner to third-parties or we may fail to secure the rights to intellectual property developed by our employees, contractors and others. Efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be time consuming and costly, distract management\u2019s attention and resources and ultimately be unsuccessful. Moreover, our failure to develop and properly manage new intellectual property could adversely affect our market positions and business opportunities.\nOur failure to obtain, maintain and enforce its intellectual property rights could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant labor dispute involving one or more of our customers, or a labor dispute that otherwise affects our operations, could reduce our revenues and harm our profitability.\nLabor disputes involving our customers could affect our operations. If our customers are unable to negotiate new labor contracts and our clients\u2019 plants experience slowdowns or closures as a result, our revenue and profitability, particularly in our Logistics segment\u2019s operations that are closely tied to clients\u2019 plants, could be negatively impacted. A labor dispute involving a supplier to our Logistics segment\u2019s clients that results in a slowdown or closure of our clients\u2019 plants to which our Logistics segment provides services could also have a material adverse effect on its business. The employees of our customers, suppliers and other service providers may be, or may in the future be, unionized and there may be strikes, lock outs or material labor disputes with respect to our customers or their suppliers in the future that materially affects our performance.\nOur overseas operations subject us to various operational and financial risks which could adversely affect our business.\nThe services we provide outside of the United States subject us to risks resulting from changes in tariffs, trade restrictions, trade agreements, tax policies, difficulties in managing or overseeing foreign operations and agents, different liability standards, issues related to compliance with anti-corruption laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, and intellectual property laws of countries which do not protect our rights in our intellectual property, including our proprietary information systems, to the same extent as the laws of the United States. The occurrence or consequences of any of these factors may restrict our ability to operate in the affected region and/or decrease the profitability of our operations in that region. As we expand our business in foreign countries, we will also be exposed to increased risk of loss from foreign currency fluctuations and exchange controls.\nIf we are unable to expand the number of our sales representatives and independent station agents, or if a significant number of our existing sales representatives and independent station agents leave us, our ability to increase our revenue could be negatively impacted.\nOur ability to expand our business will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain sales representatives and the independent station agents through which we conduct a portion of our freight forwarding operations. Competition for qualified sales representatives and brokerage agents can be intense. We may be unable to attract such persons or retain those that are already associated with us. Any difficulties we experience in expanding or retaining our sales representatives and independent\nstation agents could have a negative impact on our ability to expand our customer base, increase our revenue and continue our growth. Further, a significant increase in the turnover rate among our current sales representatives and independent station agents could also increase our recruiting costs and decrease our operating efficiency.\nWe are subject to regulation, which could negatively impact our business.\nOur operations are regulated and licensed by various governmental agencies in the United States and in foreign countries in which we operate. These regulatory agencies have authority and oversight of domestic and international transportation services and related activities, licensure, motor carrier operations, safety and security and other matters. We must comply with various insurance and surety bond requirements to act in the capacities for which we are licensed. Our subsidiaries and independent contractors must also comply with applicable regulations and requirements of such agencies. Through our subsidiaries and business units, we hold various licenses required to carry out our domestic and international services. These licenses permit us to provide services as a motor carrier, property broker, indirect air carrier, OTI, NVOCC, freight forwarder, air freight forwarder, and ocean freight forwarder. We also are subject to regulations and requirements promulgated by, among others, the DOT, FMCSA, DHS, CBP, TSA, FMC, IATA, the Canada Border Services Agency and various other international, domestic, state, and local agencies and port authorities. Our failure to maintain our required licenses, or to comply with applicable regulations, could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. See the \u201cRegulation\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption entitled \u201cBusiness\u201d for more information.\nFuture laws and regulations may be more stringent and require changes in our operating practices that influence the demand for transportation services or require us to incur significant additional costs. We are unable to predict the impact that recently enacted and future regulations may have on our businesses. Higher costs incurred by us, or incurred by our independent contractors or third-party transportation providers who pass the increased costs on to us, as a result of future new regulations could adversely affect our results of operations to the extent we are unable to obtain a corresponding increase in price from our customers.\nSeasonality affects our operations and profitability.\nThe transportation industry experiences seasonal fluctuations. Our results of operations are typically lower for the first quarter of the calendar year relative to our other quarters. We believe this is due in part to the post- holiday reduction in demand experienced by many of our customers, which leads to more capacity in the non-expedited and service-critical markets and, in turn, less demand for expedited and premium shipping services. In addition, the productivity of our independent contractors and transportation providers generally decreases during the winter season because inclement weather impedes operations.\nTerrorist attacks, anti-terrorism measures and war could have broad detrimental effects on our business operations.\nAs a result of the potential for terrorist attacks, federal, state and municipal authorities have implemented and continue to follow various security measures, including checkpoints and travel restrictions on trucking and rail routes and security screenings of air cargo on passenger aircraft and international containers. Such measures may reduce the productivity of our independent contractors and transportation providers or increase the costs associated with their operations, which we could be forced to bear. War, risk of war or a terrorist attack also may have an adverse effect on the economy. A decline in economic activity could adversely affect our revenues or restrict our future growth. Instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism or war also could impact our ability to raise capital. In addition, the insurance premiums charged for some or all of the coverage currently maintained by us could increase dramatically or such coverage could be unavailable in the future.\nOur Chairman and Chief Executive Officer controls a large portion of our stock and has substantial control over us, which could limit other stockholders\u2019 ability to influence the outcome of key transactions, including changes of control.\nOur Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Bradley S. Jacobs, controls, as the managing member of Jacobs Private Equity, LLC (\u201cJPE\u201d), (i) 67,500 shares of our Series A Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock, which are initially convertible into an aggregate of 9,642,857 shares of our common stock, and (ii) 9,642,857 warrants initially exercisable for an aggregate of 9,642,857 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $7.00 per share. Mr. Jacobs also directly owns 81,761 shares of our common stock and has employee stock options and restricted stock units convertible into an additional 484,593 shares of our common stock. Under applicable SEC rules, Mr. Jacobs beneficially owns approximately 20% of our outstanding common stock. This concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with concentrated stockholders. Our preferred stock votes together with our common stock on an \u201cas-converted\u201d basis on all matters, except as otherwise required by law, and separately as a class with respect to certain matters implicating the rights of holders of shares of the preferred stock. Accordingly, Mr. Jacobs can exert substantial influence over our management and affairs and matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions, such as mergers, consolidations or the sale of substantially all of our assets. Consequently, this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, including a merger, consolidation, or other business combination involving us, or discouraging a potential acquirer from making\na tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control, even if that change of control would benefit our other stockholders. Additionally, significant fluctuations in the levels of ownership of our largest stockholders, including JPE, could impact the volume of trading, liquidity and market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 90175, "SIC": 4731, "TIC": "XPO"}
