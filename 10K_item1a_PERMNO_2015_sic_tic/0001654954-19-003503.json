RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information included in this report on Form 10-K. An investment in our common stock is risky. If any of the following risks materialize, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. In such an event, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose part or all of your investment. When used in these risk factors, the terms \"we\" or \"our\" refer to Mymetics Corporation and its subsidiaries.\nWe are a company engaged exclusively in research and development activities, focusing primarily on vaccine development. Our strategy was crafted in part to minimize the risks usually associated with clinical trials, regulatory approvals and marketing, which we would expect to be borne by our future partner(s).\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Capital Needs\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses in the future.\nWe historically have incurred net losses. In the years ended December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, we sustained net loss of approximately E4,172 and E4,112, respectively. At December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately E84,675.\nThe amount of these losses may vary significantly from year-to-year and quarter-to-quarter and will depend on, among other factors:\n- the timing and cost of product development;\n- the progress and cost of preclinical and clinical development programs;\n- the timing and cost of obtaining necessary regulatory approvals;\n- the timing and cost of sales and marketing activities for future products; and\n- the costs of pending and any future litigation of which we may be subject.\nWe currently are engaged in research and development activities and do not have any commercially marketable products. The research and development process requires significant capital expenditures.\nThe RSV vaccine activities were funded through incoming revenue from RSV Corporation and were formally terminated as of July 25, 2016. We also have attracted funding from PATH-MVI for our malaria vaccine development and from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for the non-human primate study for our HIV vaccine candidate at Texas Biomedical Research Institute. In April 2015, Mymetics announced that it was leading a consortium of companies that have received a grant worth a total of E8.4 million. The grant will fund the evaluation, development and manufacturing scale-up of thermos-stable and cold-chain independent nano-pharmaceutical virosome-based vaccine candidates. These revenue streams and funds are not fully covering the costs of all our activities.\nAccordingly, we expect to generate additional operating losses at least until such time as we are able to generate significant revenues.\nTo become profitable, we will need to generate revenues to offset our operating costs, including our general and administrative expenses. We may not achieve or, if achieved, sustain our revenue or profit objectives, and our losses may increase in the future, and, ultimately, we may have to cease operations.\nIn order to generate new and significant revenues, we must successfully develop and commercialize our proposed products or enter into collaborative agreements with others who can successfully develop and commercialize them. Our business plan is predicated on commercializing our products in collaboration with others. Even if our proposed products are commercially introduced, they may never achieve market acceptance and we may never generate significant revenues or achieve profitability.\nWe will require additional capital to fund our operations, and if we fail to obtain necessary financing, we will be unable to complete the development and potential commercialization of our product candidates.\nOur operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception. We expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to launch and commercialize our vaccine product candidates, if we receive regulatory approval. We will require additional capital for the further development and potential commercialization of our vaccine product candidates. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on acceptable terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or any future commercialization efforts. Our future funding requirements, both near and long-term, will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to the:\n-\ninitiation, progress, timing, costs and results of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, including patient enrolment in such trials, for our product candidates or any other future product candidates;\n-\nclinical development plans we establish for our current product candidates and any other future vaccine product candidates;\n-\nnumber and characteristics of vaccine product candidates that we develop or in-license;\n-\noutcome, timing and cost of regulatory review by the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including the potential for the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities to require that we perform more studies than those that we currently expect;\n-\ncosts of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and maintaining and enforcing other intellectual property rights;\n-\neffects of competing technological and market developments;\n-\ncosts and timing of the implementation of commercial-scale manufacturing activities; and\n-\ncosts and timing of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for any product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval.\n-\nIf we are unable to expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities due to a lack of capital, our ability to become profitable will be compromised.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to product candidates.\nUntil we can generate substantial revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to seek additional capital through a combination of private and public equity offerings, debt financings, strategic collaborations, alliances and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of existing stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include liens or other restrictive covenants limiting our ability to take important actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends, or issuing warrants that if exercised could be dilutive to our stockholders. If we raise additional funds through strategic collaborations and alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our product candidates or any other future product candidates in particular countries, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financing when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or commercialization efforts or grant third parties rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nWe have not generated any revenues to date from vaccine product sales. We may never achieve or sustain profitability, which could depress the market price of our securities, and could cause you to lose all or a part of your investment.\nTo date, we have no vaccine products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenues from sales of any vaccine product candidate. We do not know when, or if, we will generate any revenues in the future. Our ability to generate revenue from product sales and achieve profitability will depend upon our ability to successfully gain regulatory approval and commercialize our current or future vaccine product candidates. Even if we are able to successfully achieve regulatory approval for any of our vaccine product candidates, we do not know when they will generate revenue from product sales for us, if at all. Our ability to generate revenue from product sales from our current or future product candidates also depends on a number of additional factors, including our ability to:\n-\nsuccessfully complete development activities, including enrolment of study participants and completion of the necessary clinical trials;\n-\ncomplete and submit new drug applications, or NDAs, to the FDA, and obtain regulatory approval for indications for which there is a commercial market;\n-\ncomplete and submit applications to, and obtain regulatory approval from, foreign regulatory authorities;\n-\nmake or have made commercial quantities of our products at acceptable cost levels;\n-\ndevelop a commercial organization capable of manufacturing, selling, marketing and distributing any products we intend to sell ourselves;\n-\nfind suitable partners to help us market, sell and distribute our approved products in markets other than the markets in which we choose to commercialize on our own; and\n-\nobtain adequate pricing, coverage and reimbursement from third parties, including government and private payers.\nIn addition, because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, including that our product candidates may not advance through development or achieve the endpoints of applicable clinical trials, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses, or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to complete the development and regulatory process for our product candidates, we anticipate incurring significant costs associated with commercializing our product candidates.\nIf we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels, which would depress the market price of our securities.\nOur existing and any future indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to operate our business.\nTwo of our major shareholders, Round Enterprises and Eardley Holding, have issued secured convertible notes, short term convertible notes and short term promissory notes, which have a total carrying amount of E54,370, including currently due interest. Under the terms of the convertible notes both Round Enterprises and Eardley Holding have the right to demand repayment at the end of the quarter following the repayment request of those convertible notes and exercise their rights as secured creditors under the terms of these notes, and we are required to repay the other notes unless Round Enterprises and Eardley Holding elect to convert the notes. We could in the future incur additional indebtedness beyond our borrowings under the outstanding secured convertible notes.\nOur outstanding indebtedness combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments, including any additional indebtedness beyond our borrowings under our secured convertible notes issued to Round Enterprises and Eardley Holding, could have significant adverse consequences, including:\n-\nrequiring us to dedicate a portion of our cash resources to the payment of interest and principal, and prepayment and repayment fees and penalties, thereby reducing money available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, product development and other general corporate purposes;\n-\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and market conditions;\n-\nsubjecting us to restrictive covenants that may reduce our ability to take certain corporate actions or obtain further debt or equity financing;\n-\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we compete; and\n-\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or better debt servicing options.\nWe may not have sufficient funds, and may be unable to arrange for additional financing, to pay the amounts due under our existing debt. Failure to make payments or comply with other covenants under our existing debt instruments could result in an event of default and acceleration of amounts due. If an event of default occurs and the lenders accelerate the amounts due, we may not be able to make accelerated payments, and the lenders could seek to enforce security interests in the collateral securing such indebtedness, which includes substantially all of our assets, including our intellectual property.\nWe might not be able to utilize a significant portion of our net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credit carryforwards.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards in the U.S. of E76 million. Of this amount, E73 million will expire in years 2019-2037. Tax credit carryforwards of E224 which if not utilized will expire in 2023. These net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset our future income tax liabilities. In addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d which is generally defined as a greater than 50% change, by value, in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. We have not determined if we have experienced Section 382 ownership changes in the past and if a portion of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation under Section 382. In addition, we may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, including this offering, some of which may be outside of our control. If we determine that an ownership change has occurred and our ability to use our historical net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards is materially limited, it would harm our future operating results by effectively increasing our future tax obligations.\nWe might not be able to continue as a going concern.\nOur cash balances, recurring losses, negative cash flows from operations, and debt outstanding as of December 31, 2018 and our projected spending in 2019, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, and our independent registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph in its report on our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 regarding this uncertainty. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, we might have to liquidate our assets and the values we receive for our assets in liquidation or dissolution could be significantly lower than the values reflected in our financial statements. In addition, the inclusion of a going concern statement by our auditors, our lack of cash resources and our potential inability to continue as a going concern may materially adversely affect the price of our securities and our ability to raise new capital or to enter into critical contractual relations with third parties.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Development of Our Products\nOur future success is dependent on the successful clinical development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our vaccine product candidates, which will require significant capital resources and years of additional clinical development effort.\nWe do not have any products that have regulatory approval. Currently, our vaccine product candidates are in varying stages of development. As a result, our business is dependent on our ability to successfully complete clinical development of, obtain regulatory approval for, and, if approved, successfully commercialize our product candidates in a timely manner. We cannot commercialize our product candidates in the United States without first obtaining regulatory approval from the FDA; similarly, we cannot commercialize our product candidates outside of the United States without obtaining regulatory approval from comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of our product candidates for a target indication, we must demonstrate with substantial evidence gathered in pre-clinical studies and well-controlled clinical trials, generally including well-controlled Phase III studies to the satisfaction of applicable regulators, that our product candidates are safe and effective for use for the target indication and that the manufacturing facilities, processes and controls are adequate. Even if our product candidates were to successfully obtain approval from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, any approval might contain significant limitations related to use restrictions for specified age groups, warnings, precautions or contraindications, or may be subject to burdensome post-approval study or risk management requirements. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates in one or more jurisdictions, or any approval contains significant limitations, we may not be able to obtain sufficient funding or generate sufficient revenue to continue the development of any of our product candidates. Furthermore, even if we obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, we will still need to develop a commercial organization, establish commercially viable pricing and obtain approval for adequate reimbursement from third party and government payers. If we are unable to successfully commercialize our product candidates, we may not be able to earn sufficient revenues to continue our business.\nBecause the results of pre-clinical studies or earlier clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results, our product candidates may not have favorable results in later clinical trials or receive regulatory approval.\nSuccess in pre-clinical studies and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will generate adequate data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of our product candidates. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including those with greater resources and experience, have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials, even after seeing promising results in earlier clinical trials. Despite the results reported in earlier pre-clinical studies and clinical trials for our HIV vaccine, we do not know whether the clinical trials we may conduct in the future will demonstrate adequate efficacy and safety to result in regulatory approval to market our product candidates in any particular jurisdiction. If later-stage clinical trials do not produce favorable results, our ability to achieve regulatory approval for our product candidates may be adversely impacted.\nThe therapeutic efficacy of our HIV and our other product candidates is unproven and we may not be able to successfully develop and commercialize our product candidates.\nOur ability to generate revenues from our HIV and our other vaccine product candidates, which we do not expect will occur for at least the next several years, if ever, will depend heavily on our successful development and commercialization after regulatory approval, if achieved, which is subject to many potential risks. For example, our HIV vaccine may not demonstrate in study subjects any or all of the results that may have been demonstrated in pre-clinical studies and earlier clinical trials. Our product candidates may interact with human biological systems in unforeseen, ineffective or harmful ways. If our product candidates are associated with undesirable side effects or have characteristics that are unexpected, we may need to abandon their development or limit development to certain uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. Many compounds that initially showed promise in early stage testing for treating certain diseases that our product candidates are intended to address have later been found to cause side effects that prevented further development of the products. As a result of these and other risks described herein that are inherent in the development of novel therapeutic agents, we may never successfully develop, enter into or maintain third party licensing or collaboration transactions with respect to, or successfully commercialize, our product candidates, in which case we will not achieve profitability and the value of our stock may decline.\nClinical development of product candidates involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome.\nClinical testing is expensive, can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. Study subject enrollment, a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials, is affected by many factors including the size and nature of the subject population, the proximity of subjects to clinical sites, seasonality, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the design of the clinical trial, ability to obtain and maintain subject consents, risk that enrolled subjects will drop out before completion, competing clinical trials and clinicians' and subjects' perceptions as to the potential advantages of the product candidate being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new vaccines that may be approved or product candidates that may be studied in competing clinical trials for the diseases we are investigating.\nClinical trials may be delayed, suspended or prematurely terminated for a variety of other reasons, such as:\n-\ndelay or failure in reaching agreement with the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority on a trial design that we are able to execute;\n-\ndelay or failure in obtaining authorization to commence a trial or inability to comply with conditions imposed by a regulatory authority regarding the scope or design of a clinical trial;\n-\ndelay or failure in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective clinical research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n-\ndelay or failure in obtaining institutional review board, or IRB, approval or the approval of other reviewing entities, including comparable foreign regulatory authorities, to conduct a clinical trial at each site;\n-\nwithdrawal of clinical trial sites from our clinical trials as a result of changing standards of care or the ineligibility of a site to participate in our clinical trials;\n-\ndelay or failure in recruiting and enrolling suitable study subjects to participate in a trial;\n-\ndelay or failure in study subjects completing a trial or returning for post-treatment follow-up;\n-\nclinical sites and investigators deviating from a trial protocol, failing to conduct the trial in accordance with regulatory requirements, or dropping out of a trial;\n-\ninability to identify and maintain a sufficient number of trial sites, many of which may already be engaged in other clinical trial programs, including some that may be for competing product candidates with the same or similar indication;\n-\nfailure of our third party clinical trial managers to satisfy their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines;\n-\ndelay or failure in adding new clinical trial sites;\n-\nambiguous or negative interim results or results that are inconsistent with earlier results;\n-\nfeedback from the FDA, the IRB, data safety monitoring boards, or a comparable foreign regulatory authority, or results from earlier stage or concurrent pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, that might require modification to the protocol for the trial;\n-\ndecision by the FDA, the IRB, a comparable foreign regulatory authority, or us, or recommendation by a data safety monitoring board or comparable foreign regulatory authority, to suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time for safety issues or for any other reason;\n-\nunacceptable risk-benefit profile, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects or adverse events;\n-\nfailure of a product candidate to demonstrate any benefit;\n-\ndifficulties in manufacturing sufficient quantities of a product candidate for use in clinical trials;\n-\nlack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial, including the incurrence of unforeseen costs due to enrolment delays, requirements to conduct additional clinical trials or increased expenses associated with the services of our CROs, clinical trial sites and other third parties; or\n-\nchanges in governmental regulations or administrative actions.\nIf we experience delays in the completion of any clinical trial of our product candidates, the commercial prospects of our product candidates may be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenues from our product candidates, if approved, will be delayed. In addition, any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our development and approval process for our product candidates and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues. In addition, many of the factors that could cause a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates.\nOur product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit the commercial profile of an approved label, or result in significant negative consequences following any marketing approval.\nUndesirable side effects caused by our vaccine product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authority or restrictive label requirements. If such side effects or other safety or toxicity issues are reported in our future clinical trials, we may not receive approval to market those products which could prevent us from ever generating revenues or achieving profitability. Results of our clinical trials could reveal an unacceptably high prevalence and severity of side effects. In such an event, our clinical trials could be suspended or terminated and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development, or deny approval, of our product candidates for any or all targeted indications. Drug-related side effects could affect study subject recruitment, affect the ability of enrolled subjects to complete our future clinical trials and may result in potential product liability claims.\nAdditionally, if any of our product candidates receive marketing approval, and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by such product, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n-\nwe may be forced to suspend marketing of the product;\n-\nregulatory authorities may withdraw their approvals of the product;\n-\nregulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label that could diminish the usage or otherwise limit the commercial success of the product;\n-\nwe may be required to conduct post-market studies;\n-\nwe could be sued, could incur substantial litigation expenses and may be held liable for harm caused to subjects or patients; and\n-\nour reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved, and materially adversely impact the market price of our securities.\nEven if one or more of our product candidates receive regulatory approval, we may still face future development and regulatory difficulties.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for one or more of our product candidates, they would be subject to ongoing requirements by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities governing manufacturing, quality control, further development, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, import, export, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and reporting of safety and other post-market information. The safety profile of our product candidates will continue to be closely monitored by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities after approval. If new safety information becomes available after approval of our product candidates, the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require labeling changes or establishment of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, or similar strategy, impose significant restrictions on our product candidates, indicated uses or marketing, or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies or post-market surveillance.\nIn addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or GMP, and other regulations. If we or a regulatory authority discover previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory authority may impose restrictions on that product, the manufacturing facility or us, including requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing. If we, our products or the manufacturing facilities for our products fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory authority may:\n-\nissue warning letters or untitled letters;\n-\nmandate modifications to promotional materials or require us to provide corrective information to healthcare practitioners;\n-\nrequire us to enter into a consent decree, which can include imposition of various fines, reimbursements for inspection costs, required due dates for specific actions and penalties for noncompliance;\n-\nseek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines;\n-\nsuspend or withdraw regulatory approval;\n-\nsuspend any ongoing clinical trials;\n-\nrefuse to approve pending applications or supplements to applications filed by us;\n-\nsuspend or impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or\n-\nseize or detain products, refuse to permit the import or export of products, or require us to initiate a product recall.\nThe occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit or preclude our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate revenue.\nChanges in regulatory requirements and guidance may also occur and we may need to amend clinical trial protocols submitted to applicable regulatory authorities to reflect these changes. Amendments may require us to resubmit clinical trial protocols to IRBs for re-examination, which may impact the costs, timing or successful completion of a clinical trial.\nThe FDA's and other regulatory authorities' policies may change, and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained, and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, if we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other studies with respect to any of our product candidates beyond those that we currently contemplate or if we are unable to successfully complete our clinical trials or other studies, we may be delayed in obtaining regulatory approval for our product candidates, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval at all or we may obtain approval for indications that are not as broad as intended. Our product development costs will also increase if we experience delays in testing or approvals and we may not have sufficient funding to complete the testing and approval process for any of our product candidates. Significant clinical trial delays could allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and impair our ability to commercialize our products if and when approved. If any of this occurs, our business will be materially harmed.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate, our products will remain subject to ongoing regulatory oversight.\nEven if we obtain any regulatory approval for our product candidates, they will be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements for manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, sampling, record-keeping and submission of safety and other post-market information. Any regulatory approvals that we receive for our product candidates also may be subject to a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, limitations on the approved indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to monitor the quality, safety and efficacy of the product. For example, the holder of an approved Biologics License Application (\u201cBLA\u201d) is obligated to monitor and report adverse events and any failure of a product to meet the specifications in the BLA. The holder of an approved BLA also must submit new or supplemental applications and obtain FDA approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling or manufacturing process. Advertising and promotional materials must comply with FDA rules and are subject to FDA review, in addition to other applicable federal and state laws.\nIn addition, product manufacturers and their facilities are subject to payment of user fees and continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, requirements and adherence to commitments made in the BLA or foreign marketing application. If we, or a regulatory authority, discover previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured or disagrees with the promotion, marketing or labeling of that product, a regulatory authority may impose restrictions relative to that product, the manufacturing facility or us, including requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements following approval of any of our product candidates, a regulatory authority may:\n-\nissue a warning letter asserting that we are in violation of the law;\n-\nseek an injunction or impose administrative, civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines;\n-\nsuspend or withdraw regulatory approval;\n-\nsuspend any ongoing clinical trials;\n-\nrefuse to approve a pending BLA or comparable foreign marketing application (or any supplements thereto) submitted by us or our strategic partners;\n-\nrestrict the marketing, manufacturing or distribution of the product;\n-\nseize or detain the product or otherwise require the withdrawal of the product from the market;\n-\nrefuse to permit the import or export of products; or\n-\nrefuse to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts.\nAny government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate negative publicity. The occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our product candidates and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIn addition, the FDA\u2019s policies, and those of equivalent foreign regulatory agencies, may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained, and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nFailure to obtain regulatory approval in international jurisdictions would prevent our product candidates from being marketed abroad.\nIn order to market and sell our products in the European Union and many other jurisdictions, including China, Japan and South Korea, we must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ substantially from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process outside the United States generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. In addition, in many countries outside the United States, it is required that the product be approved for reimbursement before the product can be approved for sale in that country. We may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the United States on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside the United States does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA. We may not be able to file for marketing approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market. If we are unable to obtain approval of our product candidates by regulatory authorities in the European Union, China, Japan, South Korea or another country or jurisdiction, the commercial prospects of our product candidates may be significantly diminished and our business prospects could decline.\nRisks Related to the Commercialization of Our Products\nOur commercial success depends upon attaining significant market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved, among physicians, patients, government and private payers and others in the medical community.\nEven if our product candidates receive regulatory approval, they may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, government and private payers, or others in the medical community. Market acceptance of our product candidates, if we receive approval, depends on a number of factors, including the:\n-\nefficacy and safety of our product candidates, or our product candidates administered with other drugs, each as demonstrated in clinical trials and post-marketing experience;\n-\nclinical indications for which our product candidates are approved;\n-\nrecommendation of physicians and patients of our product candidates as safe and effective treatments;\n-\npotential and perceived advantages of our product candidates over alternative treatments;\n-\nprevalence and severity of any side effects;\n-\nproduct labeling or product insert requirements of the FDA or other regulatory authorities;\n-\ntiming of market introduction of our product candidates as well as competitive products;\n-\ncost of treatment in relation to any alternative treatments available;\n-\navailability of coverage and adequate reimbursement and pricing by government and private payers;\n-\nrelative convenience and ease of administration; and\n-\neffectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts.\nMoreover, if our product candidates are approved but fail to achieve market acceptance in the medical community, or our products are restricted, withdrawn or recalled, or fail to be approved, as the case may be, we may not be able to generate significant revenues, which would compromise our ability to become profitable.\nIf we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates, we may be unable to generate any revenue.\nWe do not currently have an organization for the sale, marketing and distribution of any approved products and the cost of establishing and maintaining such an organization may exceed the cost-effectiveness of doing so. In order to market any approved products, we must build our sales, marketing, managerial and other non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services. If we are unable to establish adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, whether independently or with third parties, we may not be able to generate product revenue and may not become profitable. By the time that any of our product candidates are available for sale, we may be competing with other companies that have more extensive sales and marketing operations. Without an internal commercial organization or the support of third party sales and marketing functions, we may be unable to compete successfully against these more established companies. To the extent we rely on third parties to commercialize our product candidates, if approved, our revenues from product sales may be lower than if we had commercialized our product candidates ourselves, impacting how quickly we may reach profitability, if at all.\nA variety of risks associated with marketing our product candidates internationally could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe plan to seek regulatory approval for our product candidates outside of the United States, and accordingly, we expect that we will be subject to additional risks related to operating in foreign countries if we obtain the necessary approvals, including but not limited to:\n-\ndiffering regulatory requirements in foreign countries;\n-\nthe potential local sellers importing goods from a foreign market with low or lower prices rather than buying them locally from us;\n-\nunexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers, price and exchange controls and other regulatory requirements;\n-\neconomic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n-\ncosts of compliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n-\nforeign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;\n-\nforeign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenues;\n-\ndifficulties staffing and managing foreign operations;\n-\nworkforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\n-\nchallenges enforcing our contractual and intellectual property rights, especially in those foreign countries that do not respect and protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States;\n-\nproduction shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and\n-\nbusiness interruptions resulting from geo-political actions, including war and terrorism.\nThese and other risks associated with our future international operations may materially adversely affect our ability to attain or maintain profitable operations.\nOur vaccine product candidates may not receive coverage and adequate reimbursement from third party payers, which could harm our financial performance.\nOur ability to commercialize our vaccine product candidates successfully will depend, in part, on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for our product candidates and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and third party payers, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, determine which medications they will cover and establish reimbursement levels. A primary trend in the healthcare industry worldwide is cost containment through limited coverage and reimbursement. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the vaccine and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost vaccines and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for vaccines may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payers and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Third party payers often rely upon government healthcare program coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies. Increasingly, third party payers are requiring that vaccine companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for vaccines. Third party payers may also seek additional clinical evidence, beyond the data required to obtain marketing approval, demonstrating clinical benefits and value in specific patient populations before covering our product candidates for those patients.\nWe cannot be sure that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be available for our product candidates and, if reimbursement is available, what the level of reimbursement will be. Coverage and reimbursement may impact the demand for, and the price of, any approved products. If reimbursement is not available or is available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any approved products. There also may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved vaccines, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved by the relevant regulatory authorities. Moreover, eligibility for coverage and reimbursement does not imply that any vaccine will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Interim reimbursement levels for new vaccines, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may only be temporary. Reimbursement policies may change and new policies may be adopted, and we cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of such changes or new policies, either in the United States or abroad. Our inability to obtain coverage and profitable reimbursement rates from both government-funded and private payers for any approved products that we develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and our overall financial condition.\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do.\nThe development and commercialization of new vaccine products is highly competitive. We face competition with respect to our product candidates from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide. There are other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that currently are pursuing the development of products for the treatment of HIV, RSV, and other indications for which we are developing product candidates. Some of these products and therapies are based on scientific approaches that are similar to our approach, and others are based on entirely different approaches. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, foreign government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization.\nCompared to us, many of our potential competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources providing a comparative advantage. As a result of these factors, our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products before we are able to, which may limit our ability to gain a share of the market for our product candidates, if approved. Our competitors may also develop vaccines that are safer, more effective, more widely used and cheaper than ours, and may also be more successful than us in manufacturing and marketing their products. These appreciable advantages could render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of our product candidates' development and commercialization.\nMergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors and fewer potential acquirers or collaboration partners, especially if potential acquirers or collaborators acquire companies with competitive products. Smaller and other early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, management and commercial personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and subject registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and materially adversely impact our operations.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our vaccine product candidates by us or our investigators in human clinical trials. We will face an even greater risk if one or more of our product candidates receives regulatory approval and we commercially sell our products. Product liability claims may be brought against us by study subjects enrolled in our clinical trials, patients, healthcare providers or others using, administering or selling our product candidates or approved products. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product candidates or approved products caused injuries, we could incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in, for example:\n-\ndecreased demand for our product candidates and/or approved products;\n-\ntermination of clinical trial sites or entire trial programs;\n-\ninjury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n-\nwithdrawal of clinical trial subjects;\n-\nsignificant costs to defend the related litigation;\n-\nsubstantial monetary awards to clinical trial subjects or patients;\n-\nloss of revenue;\n-\ndiversion of management and scientific resources from our business operations;\n-\nthe inability to commercialize our product candidates; and\n-\nincreased scrutiny and potential investigation by, among others, the FDA, the DOJ, the Office of Inspector General of the HHS, state attorneys general, members of Congress and the public.\nOur inability to obtain and retain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of product candidates. Although we maintain such insurance, any claim that may be brought against us could result in a court judgment or settlement in an amount that is not covered, in whole or in part, by our insurance or that is in excess of the limits of our insurance coverage. Our insurance policies also have various exclusions, and we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no coverage. We may have to pay any amounts awarded by a court or negotiated in a settlement that exceed our coverage limitations or that are not covered by our insurance, and we may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient capital to pay such amounts.\nOur product liability insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover any and all liabilities that we may incur.\nProduct liability insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise. We intend to expand our product liability insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, but we may be unable to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for our product candidates, if approved for marketing. Large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us, particularly if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and adversely affect our business.\nAdditionally, if any claims are brought against us, even if we are fully covered by insurance, we may suffer harm such as adverse publicity. We also could suffer diversion of attention of technical and management personnel and incur substantial costs in resolving disputes, including litigation, with our insurance provider regarding coverage.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe rely, and will rely in the future, on third parties to conduct our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. If these third parties do not appropriately carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates.\nWe rely on third parties to monitor, manage data for, and execute our pre-clinical and clinical programs, and we control only some aspects of their activities. Because we have relied on third parties, our internal capacity to perform these functions is limited. We currently have a small number of employees, which limits the internal resources we have available to identify and monitor our third party providers. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials are conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol and legal, regulatory and scientific requirements and standards, including, for example, Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, the Animal Welfare Act and Good Clinical Practices, or GCP. Our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. Regulatory authorities enforce GCP through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If we or any of these third parties fail to comply with applicable GCP, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the relevant regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials in support of our marketing applications. We cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with GCP requirements. Failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.\nThe third parties conducting our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials are not our employees, and, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our ongoing clinical, nonclinical and pre-clinical programs. To the extent we are unable to identify and successfully manage the performance of third party service providers in the future, our business may be adversely affected. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates. As a result, our results of operations and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed.\nIf we lose our relationships with the third parties conducting our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials or providing other services to us, our vaccine development efforts could be delayed.\nWe rely on third parties for pre-clinical studies and clinical trials related to our vaccine development efforts. Our third party service providers conducting our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials generally have the right to terminate their agreements with us upon 90 days' notice for any reason and other service providers may terminate their agreement with us upon shorter notice. Generally, these agreements may also be terminated if we breach the agreement and such breach remains uncured, make a general assignment for the benefit of our creditors or if we are liquidated. Switching or adding additional third party service providers would involve additional cost and requires management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new service provider commences work and the new service provider may not provide the same type or level of services as the original provider. If any of our relationships with our third party service providers terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative service providers or to do so on commercially reasonable terms. Such transactions, if possible, may adversely impact our operations and financial performance.\nWe have no experience manufacturing our product candidates and have no manufacturing facility. We are dependent on third party manufacturers for the manufacture of our product candidates as well as on third parties for our supply chain, and if we experience problems with any such third parties, the manufacturing of our product candidates could be delayed.\nWe do not own or operate facilities for the manufacture of our product candidates. We currently have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. We currently rely on contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, for the manufacture and supply of our product candidates. To meet our projected needs for pre-clinical and clinical supplies to support our activities through regulatory approval and commercial manufacturing, the CMOs with whom we may work may need to increase the scale of production. If such CMOs are unable to satisfy our production needs, we will need to identify additional CMOs for continued production of supply for our product candidates. Although alternative third party suppliers with the necessary manufacturing and regulatory expertise and facilities exist, it could be expensive and take a significant amount of time to arrange for alternative suppliers. If we are unable to arrange for alternative third party manufacturing sources on commercially reasonable terms, in a timely manner or at all, we may not be able to complete development of our product candidates, or market or distribute our product candidates.\nWe are also reliant on the third party manufacturers for regulatory compliance, quality assurance and know-how. Certain components or know-how obtained from partners such as PX Therapeutics, supplier of GMP grade engineered mutated gp41 protein, are key components of our vaccines currently under development. Accordingly, the loss of any of these components or know-how might prevent us from achieving our business plan, despite the fact that contractual safeguards are in place. In addition a failure to synthesize and manufacture our product candidates or products eventually approved, if any, in accordance with our specifications, or the possibility of termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party would be costly or damaging to us. Further, the FDA and other regulatory authorities would require that our product candidates and any products that we may eventually commercialize be manufactured according to cGMP and similar foreign standards. Any failure by our third party manufacturers to comply with cGMP or failure to scale up manufacturing processes, including any failure to deliver sufficient quantities of our product candidates in a timely manner, could lead to a delay in, or failure to obtain, regulatory approval of our product candidates. In addition, such failure could be the basis for the FDA to issue a warning letter, withdraw approvals for our product candidates previously granted to us, or take other regulatory or legal action, including recall or seizure of outside supplies of our product candidates, total or partial suspension of production, suspension of ongoing clinical trials, refusal to approve pending applications or supplemental applications, detention of product, refusal to permit the import or export of products, injunction, or imposing civil and criminal penalties.\nDisruptions or delays in the supply of our vaccine product candidates would delay development of our product candidates and impair our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products, if approved.\nAny significant disruption in our supplier relationships could harm our business. Any significant delay in the supply of our vaccine product candidates or its key materials for an ongoing pre-clinical study or clinical trial could considerably delay completion of our pre-clinical study or clinical trial, product testing and potential regulatory approval of our product candidates. If our manufacturers or we are unable to purchase these key materials after regulatory approval has been obtained for our product candidates, the commercial launch of our product candidates would be delayed or there would be a shortage in supply, which would impair our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our product candidates.\nWe may elect to enter into licensing or collaboration agreements with respect to some or all of our vaccine product candidates in certain territories. Our dependence on such relationships may adversely affect our business.\nBecause we have limited resources, we may seek to enter into collaboration agreements with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies such as we have done with Astellas Pharma Inc. and our RSV vaccine and that we may do with Anergis SA, who has a time limited exclusive option to enter into a license and collaboration agreement with the Company for virosomes in the field of allergies, pending if Anergis is successful with their fundraising efforts. Our commercialization strategy for our product candidates may depend on our ability to enter into agreements with other collaborators to obtain assistance and funding for the development and potential commercialization of our product candidates in the territories in which we seek to partner. Despite our efforts, we may be unable to secure other collaborative licensing or other arrangements that are necessary for us to further develop and commercialize our product candidates. Supporting diligence activities conducted by potential collaborators and negotiating the financial and other terms of a collaboration agreement are long and complex processes with uncertain results. Even if we are successful in entering into collaboration agreements, collaborations may involve greater uncertainty for us, as we have less control over certain aspects of our collaborative programs than we do over our proprietary development and commercialization programs.\nAny failure by our partners to perform their obligations or any decision by our partners to terminate these agreements could negatively impact our ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approvals for and commercialize our product candidates. In the event we grant exclusive rights to such partners, we could be precluded from potential commercialization of our product candidates within the territories in which we have a partner. In addition, any termination of our collaboration agreements will terminate any funding we may receive under the relevant collaboration agreement and may impair our ability to fund further development efforts and our progress in our development programs.\nFurther, our other potential future collaborators may develop alternative products or pursue alternative technologies either on their own or in collaboration with others, including our competitors, and the priorities or focus of our collaborators may shift such that our product candidates receives less attention or resources than we would like, or they may be terminated altogether. Any such actions by our potential future collaborators may adversely affect our business prospects and ability to earn revenues. In addition, we could have disputes with our potential future collaborators, such as the interpretation of terms in our agreements. Any such disagreements could lead to delays in the development or commercialization of our product candidates or could result in time-consuming and expensive litigation or arbitration, which may not be resolved in our favor.\nIf our third party manufacturers use hazardous and biological materials in a manner that causes injury or violates applicable law, we may be liable for damages.\nOur research and development activities involve the controlled use of potentially hazardous substances, including chemical and biological materials by our third party manufacturers. Our manufacturers are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations in the United States governing medical, radioactive and hazardous materials. Although we believe that our manufacturers' procedures for using, handling, storing and disposing of these materials comply with legally prescribed standards, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from such materials. As a result of any such contamination or injury we may incur liability or local, city, state or federal authorities may curtail the use of these materials, interrupting our business operations. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines, and the liability could exceed our resources. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations is expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development and production efforts, which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nRecently enacted and future legislation, including potentially unfavorable pricing regulations or other healthcare reform initiatives, may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our product candidates and affect the prices we may obtain.\nThe regulations that govern, among other things, marketing approvals, coverage, pricing and reimbursement for new vaccine and drug products vary widely from country to country. In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to successfully sell our product candidates, if we obtain marketing approval.\nCost reduction initiatives and changes in coverage implemented through legislation or regulation could decrease utilization of and reimbursement for any approved products, which in turn would affect the price we can receive for those products. While the legislation and Medicare regulations apply only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payers often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from federal legislation or regulation may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010, or the Affordable Care Act. These new laws and subsequent legislation may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding.\nIn the United States, the European Union and other potentially significant markets for our product candidates, government authorities and third party payers are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which has resulted in lower average selling prices. Furthermore, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the European Union will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and usage, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement policies and pricing in general.\nSome countries require approval of the sale price of a vaccine or drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, we might obtain marketing approval for our product candidates in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay our commercial launch of the product, possibly for lengthy time periods, which could negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that particular country. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in our product candidates even if our product candidates obtain marketing approval. Lower pricing in one territory may cause other territories to lower their prices, and so negatively impact our revenue and our ability to recoup our investments in product candidates.\nIn addition, legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products and may increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our product candidates may be.\nLaws and regulations governing conduct of international operations may preclude us from developing, manufacturing and selling products outside of the United States and require us to develop and implement costly compliance programs.\nAs we seek to expand our operations outside of the United States, we must comply with numerous laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we plan to operate. The creation and implementation of international business practices compliance programs is costly and such programs are difficult to enforce, particularly where we must rely on third parties.\nThe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any United States individual or business from paying, offering, authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with certain accounting provisions requiring such companies to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. The anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA are enforced primarily by the DOJ. The Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, is involved with enforcement of the books and records provisions of the FCPA.\nCompliance with the FCPA is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. In addition, the FCPA presents particular challenges in the pharmaceutical industry, because, in many countries, hospitals are operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials. Certain payments to hospitals in connection with clinical trials and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to FCPA enforcement actions.\nVarious laws, regulations and executive orders also restrict the use and dissemination outside of the United States, or the sharing with certain foreign nationals, of information classified for national security purposes, as well as certain products and technical data relating to those products. Our expanding presence outside of the United States will require us to dedicate additional resources to comply with these laws, and these laws may preclude us from developing, manufacturing, or selling our product candidates outside of the United States, which could limit our growth potential and increase our development costs.\nThe failure to comply with laws governing international business practices may result in substantial penalties, including suspension or debarment from government contracting. Violation of the FCPA can result in significant civil and criminal penalties. Indictment alone under the FCPA can lead to suspension of the right to do business with the United States government until the pending claims are resolved. Conviction of a violation of the FCPA can result in long-term disqualification as a government contractor. The termination of a government contract or relationship as a result of our failure to satisfy any of our obligations under laws governing international business practices would have a negative impact on our operations and harm our reputation and ability to procure government contracts. Additionally, the SEC also may suspend or bar issuers from trading securities on United States exchanges for violations of the FCPA's accounting provisions.\nOur relationships with customers and third party payers will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third party payers will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with third party payers and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may affect the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we would market, sell and distribute our products. Even though we do not and will not control referrals of healthcare services or bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid or other third party payers, federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients' rights are and will be applicable to our business. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our operations and expose us to areas of risk including the following:\n-\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and will fully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;\n-\nfederal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which impose criminal and civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;\n-\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and also created federal criminal laws that prohibit knowingly and will fully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;\n-\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n-\nthe Affordable Care Act, which requires manufacturers of vaccines, drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies that are reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or Children's Health Insurance Program to report annually to HHS information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members and applicable group purchasing organizations; and\n-\nanalogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third party payers, including private insurers; some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry's voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and may require vaccine and drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state and foreign laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties are compliant with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve the expenditure of appropriate, and possibly significant, resources. Nonetheless, it is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to not be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights or if our intellectual property rights are inadequate for our technology and vaccine product candidates, our competitive position could be harmed.\nOur commercial success will depend in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology and vaccine products. We rely on trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws, and confidentiality and other agreements with employees and third parties, all of which offer only limited protection. Our strategy is to obtain patent protection for chemical structures, pharmacokinetic profiles, timing of administration, dose strengths and drug combinations and secondarily seek to protect specific formulations, uses and administration regimens relating to our product candidates.\nThe patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally are highly uncertain, involve complex legal and factual questions and have in recent years been the subject of much litigation. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of any patents that issue, are highly uncertain. The steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to preclude misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights, both inside and outside the United States. Further, the examination process may require us to narrow the claims of our pending patent application, which may limit the scope of patent protection that may be obtained if these applications issue. The rights that may be granted under future issued patents may not provide us with the proprietary protection or competitive advantages we are seeking. If we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and products, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficient, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or superior to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology and products may be adversely affected. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of inventions made in the course of our development and commercialization activities before it is too late to obtain patent protection on them.\nWith respect to patent rights, we do not know whether any of our patent applications will result in patents that effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing or in some cases not at all, until they are issued as a patent. Therefore we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our pending patent applications or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions.\nOur intellectual property portfolio has certain pending patent applications. If our pending patent applications fail to issue or fail to issue with a scope that is meaningful to our product candidates, or if issued, if our patents are found to be invalid, not enforceable or not infringed by competitor products, our business will be adversely affected.\nOur pending patent applications may not result in issued patents in the United States or foreign jurisdictions in which such applications are pending. Our pending applications cannot be enforced against third parties practicing the technology claimed in such applications unless and until a patent issues from such applications. Even if a patent issues, it still may be challenged as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in the loss of patent protection, the narrowing of claims in such patents or the invalidity or unenforceability of such patents, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection for our technology and products. Protecting against the unauthorized use of our technology and other intellectual property rights is expensive, difficult and may in some cases not be possible. In some cases, it may be difficult or impossible to detect third party infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, even in relation to issued patent claims, and proving any such infringement may be even more difficult.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could harm our business.\nWhile certain of our vaccine product candidates are in pre-clinical studies, we believe that the use of our product candidates in these pre-clinical studies falls within the scope of the exemptions provided by 35 U.S.C. Section 271(e) in the United States, which exempts from patent infringement liability activities reasonably related to the development and submission of information to the FDA. As our product candidates progress toward commercialization, the possibility of a patent infringement claim against us increases. There can be no assurance that our product candidates do not infringe other parties' patents or other proprietary rights, however, and competitors or other parties may assert that we infringe their proprietary rights in any event. We may become party to, or threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our product candidates, including interference or derivation proceedings before the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future. If we are found to infringe a third party's intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue commercializing our product candidates. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Under certain circumstances, we could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing our product candidates. In addition, in any such proceeding or litigation, we could be found liable for monetary damages. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business. Any claims by third parties that we have misappropriated their confidential information or trade secrets could have a similar negative impact on our business.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on our current product candidates throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws and practices of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. For example, novel formulations of existing drugs and manufacturing processes may not be patentable in certain jurisdictions, and the requirements for patentability may in certain countries, particularly developing countries. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions into or within the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products, and may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but where enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products in jurisdictions where we do not have any issued patents and our patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing with us in these jurisdictions.\nOur competitors may be able to circumvent our patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner.\nOur competitors may seek to market generic versions of any approved products by submitting abbreviated new drug applications to the FDA in which our competitors claim that our patents are invalid, unenforceable or not infringed. Alternatively, our competitors may seek approval to market their own products that are the same as, similar to or otherwise competitive with our product candidates. In these circumstances, we may need to defend or assert our patents, by means including filing lawsuits alleging patent infringement requiring us to engage in complex, lengthy and costly litigation or other proceedings. In any of these types of proceedings, a court or government agency with jurisdiction may find our patents invalid, unenforceable or not infringed. We may also fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Even if we have valid and enforceable patents, these patents still may not provide protection against competing products or processes sufficient to achieve our business objectives.\nChanges in patent laws, including recent patent reform legislation, could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents.\nObtaining and enforcing patents in the pharmaceutical industry involve technological and legal complexity, and obtaining and enforcing pharmaceutical patents is costly, time-consuming, and inherently uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection. For example, the United States Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce patents we may obtain in the future. Recent patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our patents once issued.\nThe Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, as adopted in September 2011, includes provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and that may also affect patent litigation. In particular, under the Leahy-Smith Act, the United States transitioned in March 2013 from a \"first to invent\" system to a \"first to file\" system in which the first inventor to file a patent application will be entitled to the patent. Third parties are allowed to submit prior art before the issuance of a patent by the USPTO and may become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter-parties review or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate patent rights, which could adversely affect our competitive position.\nThe USPTO recently has developed regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, and in particular, the first to file provisions, did not become effective until March 16, 2013. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submissions, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to the USPTO and foreign patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patent. The USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. There are some situations in which noncompliance cannot be cured and result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction, including, but are not limited to, any failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. If we fail to maintain the patent applications and patents, if issued, covering our product candidates, our competitive position would be adversely affected.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our intellectual property, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful and have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents, once issued, or misappropriate or otherwise violate our intellectual property rights. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of our own intellectual property rights or the proprietary rights of others. Also, third parties may initiate legal proceedings against us to challenge the validity or scope of intellectual property rights we own or control. These proceedings can be expensive and time consuming. Many of our potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to defend their intellectual property rights than we can. Litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources, which could harm our business and financial results. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent owned or controlled by us is invalid or unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable or interpreted narrowly. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our securities.\nWe may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that we have misappropriated their intellectual property through our employees and advisory board members.\nSome of our employees and advisory board members are or were previously employed or affiliated with universities or at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our potential competitors. Some of these employees and advisory board members executed proprietary rights, non-disclosure and non-competition agreements, or similar agreements, in connection with such previous employment or affiliation. Although we try to ensure that our employees and advisory board members do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees or advisory board members have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such third party. Litigation may be necessary to defend against such claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel or sustain damages. Such intellectual property rights could be awarded to a third party, and we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to commercialize our technology or products. Such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business, or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. The following examples are illustrative:\n-\nothers may be able to make compounds or formulations of our product candidates that are similar to our product candidates' formulations but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or control;\n-\nothers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights;\n-\nour competitors might conduct research and development activities in the United States and other countries that provide a safe harbor from patent infringement claims for certain research and development activities, as well as in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets; and\n-\nwe may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable.\nRisks Related to Employee Matters, Managing Growth\nOur employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could cause significant liability for us and harm our reputation.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct, including intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations or similar regulations of comparable foreign regulatory authorities, to provide accurate information to the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, to comply with manufacturing standards we have established, to comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations and similar laws and regulations established and enforced by comparable foreign regulatory authorities, and to report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. We have a code of conduct and ethics for our directors, officers and employees, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and results of operations, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nWe will need to grow the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had eight full-time employees, including those in our two subsidiaries. As our development and commercialization plans and strategies develop, or as a result of any future acquisitions, we will need additional managerial, operational, sales, marketing, financial and other resources. In addition, it may become more cost effective to bring in house certain resources currently outsourced to consultants and other third parties. Our management, personnel and systems currently in place may not be adequate to support our future growth. Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including:\n-\nmanaging our clinical trials effectively;\n-\nidentifying, recruiting, maintaining, motivating and integrating additional employees;\n-\nmanaging our internal development efforts effectively while complying with our contractual obligations to any licensors, licensees, contractors and other third parties;\n-\nimproving our managerial, development, operational and finance systems; and\n-\nexpanding our facilities.\nAs our operations expand, we will need to manage additional relationships with various strategic partners, suppliers and other third parties. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our product candidates, if approved, and to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth effectively. To that end, we must be able to manage our development efforts and clinical trials effectively and hire, train and integrate additional management, administrative and sales and marketing personnel. Our failure to accomplish any of these tasks could prevent us from successfully growing our company.\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain our executive officers and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nWe are highly dependent upon. Ronald Kempers, our President, CEO and CFO, and our two CSOs. The employment agreements we have with the persons named above do not prevent such persons from terminating their employment with us at any time. Although we currently do not maintain \"key person\" insurance for any of our executives or other employees, we intend to obtain this insurance following this offering. The loss of the services of any of these persons could impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain highly qualified employees, and other personnel, advisors and consultants with scientific, technical and managerial expertise, we may not be able to grow effectively.\nOur future growth and success depend on our ability to recruit, retain, manage and motivate our employees, consultants and other third parties. The loss of any member of our senior management team or the inability to hire or retain experienced management personnel could compromise our ability to execute our business plan and harm our operating results.\nBecause of the specialized scientific and managerial nature of our business, we rely heavily on our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific, technical and managerial personnel, advisors and consultants. The competition for qualified personnel in the pharmaceutical field is intense and as a result, we may be unable to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business.\nWe may acquire other assets or businesses, or form collaborations or make investments in other companies or technologies that could harm our operating results, dilute our stockholders' ownership, increase our debt or cause us to incur significant expense.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may pursue acquisitions of assets, including pre-clinical, clinical or commercial stage products or product candidates, or businesses, or strategic alliances and collaborations, to expand our existing technologies and operations. We may not identify or complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any such transaction, any of which could have a detrimental effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We have limited experience with acquiring other companies, products or product candidates, and limited experience with forming strategic alliances and collaborations. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates, and if we make any acquisitions, we may not be able to integrate these acquisitions successfully into our existing business and we may incur additional debt or assume unknown or contingent liabilities in connection therewith. Integration of an acquired company or assets may also disrupt ongoing operations, require the hiring of additional personnel and the implementation of additional internal systems and infrastructure, especially the acquisition of commercial assets, and require management resources that would otherwise focus on developing our existing business. We may not be able to find suitable strategic alliance or collaboration partners or identify other investment opportunities, and we may experience losses related to any such investments.\nTo finance any acquisitions or collaborations, we may choose to issue debt or equity securities as consideration. Any such issuance of securities would dilute the ownership of our stockholders. If the price of our common stock is low or volatile, we may not be able to acquire other assets or companies or fund a transaction using our stock as consideration. Alternatively, it may be necessary for us to raise additional funds for acquisitions through public or private financings. Additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of computer system failures.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems, and those of third parties on which we rely, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, fire, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. In addition, our systems safeguard important confidential personal data regarding subjects enrolled in our clinical trials. If a disruption event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our drug development programs. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed, ongoing or planned clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further development of our product candidates could be delayed.\nBusiness disruptions could seriously harm our future revenues and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nOur operations could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, water shortages, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics and other natural or man-made disasters or business interruptions. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm our operations and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. We rely on third party manufacturers to produce our product candidates. Our ability to obtain clinical supplies of our product candidates could be disrupted if the operations of these suppliers are affected by a man-made or natural disaster or other business interruption, as we do not carry insurance to cover such risks.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Securities\nWe do not know whether an active, liquid and orderly trading market will develop for our securities or what the market price of our securities will be and as a result it may be difficult for you to sell your shares of common stock.\nThere is currently an illiquid market for our securities. The lack of an active market may impair your ability to sell those securities at the time you wish to sell them or at a price that you consider reasonable. The lack of an active market may also reduce the fair market value of your securities. Further, an inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital by selling securities and may impair our ability to enter into collaborations or acquire companies or products by using our securities as consideration.\nInsiders have substantial influence over us and could delay or prevent a change in corporate control.\nOur executive officers, directors and our largest shareholder whose representative serves on the Board of Directors collectively owned approximately 54% of our outstanding voting stock. This concentration of ownership could harm the market price of our securities by:\n-\nlimiting the volume of active trading;\n-\ndelaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our company;\n-\nimpeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving our company; or\n-\ndiscouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company.\nThe interests of this group of stockholders may not always coincide with your interests or the interests of other stockholders and they may act in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders, including seeking a premium value for their securities, and might negatively affect the prevailing market price for our securities.\nIf we do not meet the listing standards of a national securities exchange our investors\u2019 ability to make transactions in our securities will be limited and we will be subject us to additional trading restrictions.\nOur securities currently are traded over-the-counter on the OTCQB market and are not qualified to be listed on a national securities exchange, such as NASDAQ. Accordingly, we face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n-\na limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n-\nreduced liquidity with respect to our securities;\n-\nour shares of common stock are currently classified as \u201cpenny stock\u201d which requires brokers trading in our shares of common stock to adhere to more stringent rules, resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our shares of common stock;\n-\na limited amount of news and analyst coverage for our company; and\n-\na decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nThe National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as \u201ccovered securities.\u201d Since our common stock is traded on the OTCQB, our common stock is a covered security. Although the states are preempted from regulating the sale of our securities, the federal statute allows the states to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud, and, if there is a finding of fraudulent activity, then the states can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case. Further, if we were no longer traded over-the-counter, our common stock would not be a covered security and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting in the future, we may not be able to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our securities.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls for financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In our annual reports on Form 10-K, we are required, under Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment needed to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that results in more than a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act also generally requires an attestation from our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nOur compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. We currently do not have an internal audit group, and we will need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge, and compile the system and process documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404. We may not be able to complete our evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion. During the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. We cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our securities could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.\nThese inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements or insufficient disclosures due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gain.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. In addition, the terms of any future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our securities will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive plans, will result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our trading price to fall.\nWe expect that significant additional capital will be needed in the future to continue our planned operations. To raise capital, we may sell substantial amounts of common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock. These future issuances of equity or equity-linked securities, together with the exercise of stock options and warrants granted in the future and any additional shares issued in connection with acquisitions, if any, may result in material dilution to our investors. Such sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock.\nOur Board of Directors and stockholders also has adopted a 2013 Stock Incentive Plan reserving for issuance 30 million shares of our common stock. Future equity incentive grants and issuances of common stock under our equity incentive plans may have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities.\nIf there is significant downward pressure on the price of our common stock, it may encourage shareholders to sell shares by means of short sales or otherwise. Short sales involve the sale, usually with a future delivery date, of common stock the seller does not own. Covered short sales are sales made in an amount not greater than the number of shares subject to the short seller's right to acquire common stock, such as upon exercise of warrants. A holder of warrants may close out any covered short position by exercising all, or a portion, of its warrants, or by purchasing shares in the open market. In determining the source of shares to close out the covered short position, a holder of warrants will likely consider, among other things, the price of common stock available for purchase in the open market as compared to the exercise price of the warrants. The existence of a significant number of short sales generally causes the price of common stock to decline, in part because it indicates that a number of market participants are taking a position that will be profitable only if the price of the common stock declines.\nSome provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws that will become effective in connection with consummation of this offering, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders, or remove our current management. These include provisions that:\n-\npermit our Board of Directors to issue up to ten million shares of preferred stock, with any rights, preferences and privileges as it may designate;\n-\nprovide that all vacancies on our Board of Directors, including as a result of newly created directorships, may, except as otherwise required by law, be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum;\n-\nestablish a classified Board of Directors such that only one of three classes of directors is elected each year;\n-\nnot provide for cumulative voting rights, thereby allowing the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock entitled to vote in any election of directors to elect all of the directors standing for election;\n-\nprovide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called by a majority of the Board of Directors;\n-\nprovide that our board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal the bylaws.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our Board of Directors, who are responsible for appointing the members of our management. Because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring us or merging with us whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not, in general, engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the Board of Directors has approved the transaction. Any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nOur management and Board of Directors control a substantial percentage of our stock and therefore have the ability to exercise substantial control over our affairs.\nAs of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our directors, executive officers and our largest shareholder whose representative serves on our Board of Directors owned approximately 54% of our outstanding common stock in the aggregate. Because of the large percentage of stock held by our directors, executive officers and our largest shareholder whose representative serves on our Board of Directors, these persons could influence the outcome of any matter submitted to a vote of our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 81269, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "MYMX"}
