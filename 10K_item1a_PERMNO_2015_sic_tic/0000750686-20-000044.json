{"cik": "750686", "company": "CAMDEN NATIONAL CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in the Company involves risk, which could be substantial. Market, liquidity, credit, operational, legal, compliance, reputational and strategic risks are inherent in our business. The material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect the Company are described below. Any of the following risks could affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations and could be material and/or adverse in nature. You should consider all of the following risks together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to the Operation of Our Business\nOur loans are concentrated in certain areas of Maine and adverse conditions in those markets could adversely affect our operations.\nWe primarily serve individuals and businesses located in the state of Maine, with 76% of our loan portfolio concentrated among borrowers in Maine as of December 31, 2019, with higher concentrations of exposure in Cumberland, Hancock, Kennebec, Knox, Penobscot and York counties. Further, because a substantial portion of the loan portfolio is secured by real estate in this area, the value of the associated collateral is also subject to regional real estate market conditions. Adverse economic, political or business developments or natural hazards may affect these areas and the ability of property owners in these areas to make payments of principal and interest on the underlying mortgages. If these regions experience adverse economic, political or business conditions, we would likely experience higher rates of loss and delinquency on these loans than if the loans were more geographically diverse.\nWe experience strong competition within our markets, which may impact our profitability.\nCompetition in the banking and financial services industry is strong. In our market areas, we compete for loans, deposits and other financial products and services with large financial companies, local independent banks, thrift institutions, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, brokerage and investment banking firms, and other financial intermediaries that offer similar services. Some of these competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits than those of the Bank and may offer services that the Bank does not or cannot provide. Some of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations we are, and, as a result, may be able to compete more effectively for business. In particular, the activity of marketplace lenders and other financial technology companies (\u201cfintechs\u201d) has grown significantly over recent years and is expected to continue to grow. Fintechs have and may continue to offer bank or bank-like products. For example, a number of fintechs have applied for bank or industrial loan charters. In addition, other fintechs have partnered with existing banks to allow them to offer deposit products to their customers. Regulatory changes, such as the recently proposed revisions to the FDIC\u2019s rules on brokered deposits, may also make it easier for fintechs to partner with banks and offer deposit products. There is also increased competition by out-of-market competitors through online and mobile channels. Our long-term success depends on our ability to compete successfully with other financial institutions and fintechs. Because we maintain a smaller staff and have fewer financial and other resources than larger institutions with which we compete, we may be limited in our ability to attract customers. If we are unable to attract and retain customers, we may be unable to achieve growth in the loan and core deposit portfolios, and our results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted.\nOur loan portfolio includes commercial real estate and commercial loans, which are generally riskier than other types of loans.\nAt December 31, 2019, our commercial real estate and commercial loan portfolios comprised 54% of our total loan balances. Commercial loans generally carry larger loan balances and involve a higher risk of nonpayment or late payment than residential mortgage loans. Commercial loans may lack standardized terms and may include a balloon payment feature. The ability of a borrower to make or refinance a balloon payment may be affected by a number of factors, including the financial condition of the borrower, prevailing economic conditions and prevailing interest rates. Repayment of these loans is generally more dependent on the economy and the successful operation of a business. Because of the risks associated with commercial loans, we may experience higher rates of default than if the portfolio were more heavily weighted toward residential mortgage loans. Higher rates of default could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the most significant industry concentration within our loan portfolio was nonresidential building operators (operators of commercial and industrial buildings, retail establishments, theaters, banks and insurance buildings), which was 12% of our total loans and 31% of our total commercial real estate portfolio. As of December 31, 2019, we had no other industry concentrations in excess of 10% of total loans.\nIf our allowance for loan losses is not adequate to cover actual loan losses, our earnings could decrease.\nWe make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio and provide an allowance for probable loan losses based on a number of factors. On a monthly basis, management reviews the allowance for loan losses to assess recent asset quality trends and impact on the Company's financial condition. On a quarterly basis, the allowance for loan losses is reviewed and approved at the Bank's Board of Directors meeting. If our assumptions are incorrect, the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover the losses we could experience, which would have an adverse effect on operating results, and may also cause us to increase the allowance for loan losses in the future. In addition, bank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provisions for credit losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by regulatory authorities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. If additional amounts are provided to the allowance for loan losses, our earnings could decrease.\nFluctuations in market interest rates may adversely affect our performance.\nOur profitability depends to a large extent upon our net interest income, which is the difference between interest income earned from loans and investments and the interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings. Net interest income is our largest source of revenue and can be affected significantly by changes in market interest rates. In particular, changes in relative interest rates may reduce our net interest income as the difference between interest income and interest expense decreases. As a result, we have adopted asset and liability management policies to minimize the potential adverse effects of changes in interest rates on net interest income, primarily by altering the mix and maturity of loans, investments and funding sources.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our balance sheet composition supported an asset sensitive interest rate risk position over a one- and two-year period. This would suggest that if interest rates were to decrease, then net interest income would decrease, reducing revenue and net income, while an increase in interest rates would increase net interest income, increasing revenue and net income. However, there can be no assurance that a change in interest rates will not negatively impact our results of operations or financial condition. Because market interest rates may change by differing magnitudes and at different times, significant changes in interest rates over an extended period of time could reduce overall net interest income. An increase in interest rates could also have a negative impact on our results of operations by slowing loan production, and specifically, loan refinance activity, and/or reducing the ability of borrowers to repay their current loan obligations, which could not only result in increased loan defaults, foreclosures and write-offs, but also necessitate further increases to our allowance for loan losses.\nA downgrade or potential downgrade of the U.S. Government's sovereign credit rating by one or more credit ratings agencies could adversely affect our business.\nFuture uncertainty over U.S. fiscal policy could result in a downgrade or a reduction in the outlook of the U.S. long-term sovereign credit rating by one or more credit ratings agencies. Any downgrade, or perceived future downgrade, in the U.S. sovereign credit rating or outlook could adversely affect global financial markets and economic conditions and may result in, among other things, increased volatility and illiquidity in the capital markets, declines in consumer confidence, increased unemployment levels and declines in the value of U.S. Treasury securities and securities guaranteed by the U.S. government. As a result, our business, liquidity, results of operations and financial conditions may be adversely affected. Additionally, the economic conditions resulting from any such downgrade or perceived future downgrade may significantly exacerbate the other risks we face.\nOur cost of funds may increase as a result of loss of deposits or a change in deposit mix.\nDeposits are a low cost, stable source of funding. We compete with banks, other financial institutions and fintechs for deposits. Funding costs may increase if we lose deposits and are forced to replace them with more expensive sources of funding, if clients shift their deposits into higher cost products or if we need to raise interest rates to avoid losing deposits. Higher funding costs reduce our net interest margin, net interest income and net income.\nAs of December 31, 2019, brokered deposits made up 5% of our total deposits. We have and will continue to utilize brokered deposits when it is a more cost effective source of funding compared to alternative funding sources. Should we become less than well-capitalized under the prompt corrective action framework, our use of brokered deposits may be limited, which could result in the use of more costly funding sources that would reduce our net interest margin, net interest income and net income. See \u201cSupervision and Regulation-Capital Adequacy and Safety and Soundness-Prompt Corrective Action\u201d and \u201cSupervision and Regulations-Regulation of the Bank-Brokered Deposits\u201d for additional information on the prompt corrective action framework and the regulation of brokered deposits.\nWholesale funding sources may prove insufficient to replace deposits and support our operations and future growth.\nThe Company and the Bank must maintain sufficient funds to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers. To manage liquidity, we draw upon a number of funding sources in addition to core deposit growth and repayments and maturities of loans and investments. These sources include brokered deposits, borrowings through the Federal Home Loan Bank and correspondent banks, proceeds from the sale of investments and loans, and liquidity resources at the holding company. Our ability to manage liquidity will be severely constrained if we are unable to maintain access to funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate future growth at acceptable costs. In addition, if we are required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources to support future growth, our revenues may not increase proportionately to cover our costs. In this case, operating margins and profitability would be adversely affected. Turbulence in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and the willingness of certain counterparties and customers to do business with us.\nWe could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. We maintain a diversified securities portfolio and have exposure to many different counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry, including brokers and dealers, other commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other financial institutions. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, could lead to market-wide liquidity problems and losses or defaults by us or by other institutions and organizations. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. Furthermore, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be liquidated or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to us. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe believe that we have adequately reviewed our investment securities for impairment and we did not recognize any other-than-temporary impairments on our investment securities portfolio in 2019. However, over time, the economic and market environment may provide additional insight regarding the fair value of certain securities, which could change our judgment regarding impairment. In addition, if a counterparty should default, become insolvent, declare bankruptcy, or otherwise cease to exist, the value of our investment may be impaired. This could result in realized losses relating to other-than-temporary declines being charged against future income. Given the significant judgments involved, there is risk that material other-than-temporary impairments may be charged to income in future periods, resulting in realized losses.\nMarket changes may adversely affect demand for our services and impact results of operations.\nChannels for servicing our customers are evolving rapidly, with less reliance on traditional branches, more use of online and mobile banking, and increased demand for universal bankers and other relationship managers who can service multiple product lines. We compete with larger providers that are rapidly evolving their service offerings, thereby escalating the costs of evolving the Bank\u2019s efforts to keep pace. We have a process for evaluating the profitability of our branches and other office and operational facilities. The identification of unprofitable operations and facilities can lead to restructuring charges and introduce the risk of disruptions to revenues and customer relationships.\nOur financial condition and results of operations have been adversely affected, and may continue to be adversely affected, by the U.S. and international financial market and economic conditions.\nWe have been, and continue to be, impacted by general business and economic conditions in the United States and, to a lesser extent, abroad. These conditions include short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation, money supply, political issues, legislative and regulatory changes, fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets, broad trends in industry and finance, unemployment and investor confidence, all of which are beyond our control. Although there has been gradual improvement in the U.S. economy over the past decade, deterioration in any of these conditions could result in increases in loan delinquencies and non-performing assets, decreases in loan collateral values, the value of our investment portfolio and demand for our products and services. Higher credit or collateral related losses, or decreases in the value of our investment portfolio or demand for our products and services, could negatively impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nPrepayments of loans may negatively impact our business.\nGenerally, our customers may prepay the principal amount of their outstanding loans at any time, frequently without financial penalty to the borrower. The speeds at which such prepayments occur, as well as the size of such prepayments, are within our customers\u2019 discretion. Fluctuations in interest rates, in certain circumstances, may also lead to high levels of loan prepayments. If customers prepay the principal amount of their loans, and we are unable to lend those funds to other borrowers or invest the funds at the same or higher interest rates, interest income will be reduced. A significant reduction in interest income could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits and legal proceedings that may lead to adverse consequences.\nAs a participant in the financial services industry, many aspects of the Company\u2019s business involve substantial risk of legal liability. From time to time, we are named or threatened to be named as defendants in various lawsuits, including class actions, arising from our business activities. In addition, when other financial institutions receive adverse judgments in litigation or\nagree to settlements, that may encourage plaintiffs and their attorneys to bring and maintain claims, including class actions,\nagainst other financial institutions, including the Company. There is no assurance that litigation with private parties will not increase in the future. Future actions against us may result in judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other results adverse to us, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause serious reputational harm to us. Although we maintain insurance, the scope of this coverage may not provide us with full, or even partial, coverage in any particular case. As a result, a judgment against us in any such litigation and/or legal costs incurred in defending us against such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.\nWe may incur fines, penalties and other negative consequences from regulatory violations, possibly even inadvertent or unintentional violations.\nThe financial services industry is subject to intense scrutiny from bank supervisors in the examination process and aggressive enforcement of federal and state regulations, particularly with respect to mortgage-related practices and other consumer compliance matters, and compliance with AML, BSA and OFAC regulations, and economic sanctions against certain foreign countries and nationals. Enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. In addition, some legal/regulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even though there were systems and procedures designed to ensure compliance in place at the time. There have been a number of significant enforcement actions in recent years by regulators, state attorneys general and the Department of Justice against banks and other non-bank financial institutions with respect to AML and sanctions laws, and some have resulted in substantial penalties including criminal pleas. Although the Company and the Bank have adopted policies and procedures designed to comply with these laws, any failure to comply with these laws and other regulations, or to maintain an adequate compliance program, could result in significant fines, penalties, lawsuits, regulatory sanctions, reputational damage, or restrictions on our business.\nWe are subject to numerous laws designed to meet the credit needs of low- and moderate-income communities and to protect consumers, including the Community Reinvestment Act and fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions.\nThe Community Reinvestment Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose community investment and nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The FRB, OCC, CFPB, the Department of Justice and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. A successful regulatory challenge to an institution\u2019s performance under the Community Reinvestment Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act or other fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions, including damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions, restrictions on expansion and restrictions on entering new business lines. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution\u2019s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. Such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDamage to our reputation could significantly harm our business.\nWe are dependent on our reputation within our market area, as a trusted and responsible financial company, for all aspects of our relationships with customers, employees, vendors, third-party service providers and others with whom we conduct business or potential future business, particularly because our business is primarily concentrated in certain areas of Maine. Our actual or perceived failure to (i) identify and address potential conflicts of interest, ethical issues, money-laundering, or privacy issues; (ii) meet legal and regulatory requirements applicable to the Bank and to the Company; (iii) maintain the privacy of\ncustomer and accompanying personal information; (iv) maintain adequate record keeping; (v) engage in proper sales and trading practices; and (vi) identify the legal, reputational, credit, liquidity and market risks inherent in our products; or any action of one of our employees that results in actual or perceived misconduct or error, among other things, could give rise to reputational risk that could cause harm to the Bank and our business prospects. If we fail to address any of these issues in an appropriate manner, we could be subject to additional legal risks, which, in turn, could increase the size and number of litigation claims and damages asserted or subject us to enforcement actions, fines and penalties and cause us to incur related costs and expenses. Because we primarily serve individuals and businesses located in Maine, any negative impact resulting from reputational harm, including any impact on our ability to attract and retain customers and employees, likely would be greater than if our business were more geographically diverse. Moreover, the advent and expansion of social media creates the potential for rapid and widespread dissemination of information, including inaccurate, misleading, or false information, that could damage our reputation and affect our ability to attract and retain customers and employees.\nWe may incur significant losses as a result of ineffective risk management processes and strategies.\nWe seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a risk and control framework encompassing a variety of separate but complementary financial, credit, operational, compliance and legal reporting systems, internal controls, management review processes and other mechanisms. While we employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques, those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application may not be effective and may not anticipate every economic and financial outcome in all market environments or the specifics and timing of such outcomes. Market conditions over the last several years have involved unprecedented dislocations and highlight the limitations inherent in using historical data to manage risk. If our risk and control framework, or the assumptions underlying our framework, prove ineffective, we may not be able to mitigate our risk exposures effectively, and, as a result, we could incur litigation, negative regulatory consequences, reputational damage or other adverse consequences, and we could suffer unexpected losses that may affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business may be adversely affected if we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees.\nThe Company\u2019s employees are its most important resource, and in many areas of the financial services industry, competition for qualified personnel is intense. If the Company provides inadequate succession planning, or is unable to continue to retain and attract qualified employees, this could result in a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s performance, including its competitive position.\nWe could be held responsible for environmental liabilities of properties we acquired through foreclosure.\nIn the course of business, we may acquire, through foreclosure, properties securing loans originated or purchased that are in default. Particularly in commercial real estate lending, there is a risk that material environmental violations could be discovered on these properties. In this event, we might be required to remedy these violations at the affected properties at our sole cost and expense. The cost of remedial action could substantially exceed the value of affected properties. We may not have adequate remedies against the prior owner or other responsible parties and could find it difficult or impossible to sell the affected properties. These events could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nSystems failures, interruptions or breaches of security concerning our information base, including the information we maintain relating to our customers, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we rely on electronic communications and information systems to conduct our business and to store sensitive data, including financial information regarding customers. We are subject to certain operational risks, including, but not limited to, data processing system failures and errors, inadequate or failed internal processes, customer or employee fraud, cyberattacks, hacking, identity theft and catastrophic failures resulting from terrorist acts or natural disasters. We depend upon data processing, software, communication, and information exchange on a variety of computing platforms and networks and over the internet, and we rely on the services of a variety of vendors to meet our data processing and communication needs. Despite instituted safeguards, we cannot be certain that all of our systems are entirely free from vulnerability to attack or other technological difficulties or failures. If information security is breached or other technology difficulties or failures occur, information may be lost or misappropriated, services and operations may be interrupted and we could be exposed to claims from customers. While we maintain a system of internal controls and procedures, any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nWe regularly assess and test our security systems and disaster preparedness, including back-up systems, but the risks are substantially escalating. As a result, cybersecurity and the continued enhancement of our controls and processes to protect our systems, data and networks from attacks, unauthorized access or significant damage remain a priority. We have expended\nsubstantial resources to protect our systems, and may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures in our computer systems and networks, and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through insurance maintained by us. Any such losses, which may be difficult to detect, could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. In addition, the occurrence of such a loss could expose the Company and the Bank to reputational risk, the loss of customers and additional regulatory scrutiny.\nWe are subject to a variety of cybersecurity risks that, if realized, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInformation security risks for financial institutions such as the Company and the Bank have increased significantly in recent years due to the use of online, telephone and mobile banking channels by customers and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists and other external parties. Third parties with whom we or our customers do business also present operational and information security risks to us, including security breaches or failures of their own systems. Our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential information in our computer systems and networks. Our businesses rely on our digital technologies, computer and email systems, software, and networks to conduct their operations. Our technologies, systems, networks and our customers\u2019 devices are periodically the target of cyberattacks, and may be the target of future cyberattacks, including through the introduction of computer viruses, and/or malicious code, or by means of phishing attacks, social engineering or other information security breaches. Malicious actors may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information, including passwords and other identifying information, in order to gain access to data or our systems.\nIn recent years, there have been several well-publicized attacks on various companies, including in the financial services industry, and personal, proprietary, and public e-mail systems in which the perpetrators gained unauthorized access to confidential information and customer data, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyberattacks, phishing, or other means. Even if not directed at the Company or the Bank specifically, attacks on other entities with whom we do business or on whom we otherwise rely or attacks on financial or other institutions important to the overall functioning of the financial system could adversely affect, directly or indirectly, aspects of our business.\nFurthermore, as cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our systems or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities. System enhancements and updates may also create risks associated with implementing and integrating new systems. Due to the complexity and interconnectedness of information technology systems, the process of enhancing our systems can itself create a risk of systems disruptions and security issues.\nAlthough we believe we have appropriate information security controls and procedures, we may not be able to anticipate, detect, or implement effective preventative measures against all potential threats, particularly because the techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, often are not recognized until launched and can be initiated from a variety of sources. In the event one or more of the events described above occurs, this could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of our or our customers\u2019 confidential, proprietary and other information, the theft of customer assets through fraudulent transactions or disruption of our or our customers\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 business operations, which could result in legal or regulatory action, significant losses, increased compliance costs or reputational damage, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe must adapt to information technology changes in the financial services industry, which could present operational issues, require significant capital spending, or impact our reputation.\nThe financial services industry is constantly undergoing technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. We invest significant resources in information technology system enhancements in order to provide functionality and security at an appropriate level. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and reduce costs. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. Failure to successfully implement and integrate future system enhancements could adversely impact the ability to provide timely and accurate financial information in compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, which could result in sanctions from regulatory authorities. Such sanctions could include fines and suspension of trading in our stock, among others. In addition, future system enhancements could have higher than expected costs and/or result in operating inefficiencies, which could increase the costs associated with the implementation as well as ongoing operations.\nFailure to properly utilize system enhancements that are implemented in the future could result in impairment charges that adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations and could result in significant costs to remediate or replace the defective components. In addition, we may incur significant training, licensing, maintenance, consulting and amortization expenses during and after systems implementations, and any such costs may continue for an extended period of time.\nWe rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure.\nThird party vendors provide key components of our business infrastructure such as internet connections, network access and core application processing. While we have selected these third party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including as a result of their not providing us their services for any reason or their performing their services poorly, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers or otherwise conduct our business efficiently and effectively. Replacing these third party vendors could also entail significant delay and expense.\nThird parties with which we do business could also be sources of information security risk to us, including from breakdowns, systems failures or cyber threats through their systems to our systems. Any of these occurrences could impact our ability to operate our business, or cause financial loss, potential liability to clients, reputational damage or regulatory consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nNatural disasters, acts of terrorism and other external events could harm our business.\nNatural disasters can disrupt our operations, result in damage to our properties, reduce or destroy the value of the collateral for our loans and negatively affect the economies in which we operate, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. A significant natural disaster, such as a tornado, hurricane, earthquake, fire or flood, could have a material adverse impact on our ability to conduct business, and our insurance coverage may be insufficient to compensate for losses that may occur. Because we primarily serve individuals and businesses located in Maine, a natural disaster likely would have a greater impact on our business, operations and financial condition than if our business were more geographically diverse. Acts of terrorism, war, civil unrest, violence or human error could cause disruptions to our business or the economy as a whole. While we have established and regularly test disaster recovery procedures, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, there have been reports that the recent coronavirus outbreak which originated in China, has significantly impacted other countries, including disrupting or restricting supply chains, which has resulted in closures of facilities and reduction in demand across companies in a variety of industries. Recent developments and reports relating to the coronavirus have coincided with heightened volatility in financial markets in the U.S. and globally. If the coronavirus affects (i) the ability of our borrowers to satisfy their obligations; (ii) the demand for our products and services; (iii) causes our business to be interrupted; and/or (iv) leads to a significant or sustained impact on global markets or economic growth, our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nCamden National Wealth Management may be negatively affected by changes in economic and market conditions.\nA substantial portion of income from fiduciary services is dependent on the market value of wealth management assets under administration, which are primarily marketable securities. Changes in domestic and foreign economic conditions, volatility in financial markets, and general trends in business and finance, all of which are beyond our control, could adversely impact the market value of these assets and the fee revenues derived from the management of these assets. For example, the uncertainty surrounding the terms of the U.K.\u2019s exit from the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d), or Brexit, could negatively impact markets and cause weaker macroeconomic conditions that extend beyond the U.K. and the EU that could continue for the foreseeable future.\nDue to strong competition, Camden National Wealth Management may not be able to attract and retain clients at current levels. Competition is strong as there are numerous well-established and successful investment management and wealth advisory firms including commercial banks and trust companies, investment advisory firms, mutual fund companies, stock brokerage firms, and other financial companies. Our ability to attract and retain wealth management clients is dependent upon our ability to compete with competitors\u2019 investment products, level of investment performance, client services, and marketing and distribution capabilities. If we are not successful, our results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted.\nIf we do not maintain net income growth, the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nReturn on shareholders\u2019 equity and other measures of profitability, which affect the market price of our common stock, depend in part on continued growth and expansion. Our growth strategy has two principal components: internal growth and external growth. The ability to generate internal growth is affected by the competitive factors described herein as well as by the primarily rural characteristics and related demographic features of the markets we serve. The ability to continue to identify and invest in suitable acquisition candidates on acceptable terms is an important component of our external growth strategy. In pursuing acquisition opportunities, we may be in competition with other companies having similar growth strategies. As a result, we may not be able to identify or acquire promising acquisition candidates on acceptable terms. Competition for these acquisitions could result in increased acquisition prices and a diminished pool of acquisition opportunities. An inability to find suitable acquisition candidates at reasonable prices could slow our growth rate and have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock.\nOur financial statements are based in part on assumptions and estimates, which, if wrong, could cause unexpected losses in the future.\nPursuant to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, we are required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements, including in determining credit loss reserves, reserves related to litigation and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities, among other items. If assumptions or estimates underlying our financial statements are incorrect, we may experience material losses. For additional information, see Item 7. \"Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies.\"\nWe may be required to write down goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets.\nWhen we acquire a business, a portion of the purchase price of the acquisition may be allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired determines the amount of the purchase price that is allocated to goodwill. At December 31, 2019, our goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets totaled $98.2 million. Under current accounting standards, if we determine goodwill or intangible assets are impaired, we would be required to write down the value of these assets to fair value. We conduct an annual review, or more frequently if events or circumstances warrant such additional review, to determine whether goodwill is impaired. We recently completed our goodwill impairment analysis as of November 30, 2019 and concluded goodwill was not impaired. We conduct a review of our other intangible assets for impairment should events or circumstances warrant such review. There were no triggers for such review for impairment for other intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2019. We cannot provide assurance that we will not be required to take an impairment charge in the future. Any impairment charge would have a negative effect on our shareholders\u2019 equity and financial results and may cause a decline in our stock price.\nContinued market volatility may impact our business and the value of our common stock.\nOur business performance and the trading price of shares of our common stock may be affected by many factors affecting financial institutions, including volatility in the credit, mortgage and housing markets, the markets for securities relating to mortgages or housing, and the value of debt and mortgage-backed and other securities that we hold in our investment portfolio. Government action and legislation may also impact us and the value of our common stock. We cannot predict what impact, if any, volatility will have on our business or share price and for these and other reasons our shares of common stock may trade at a price lower than that at which they were purchased.\nWe are a holding company and dependent upon our subsidiary for dividends, distributions and other payments.\nWe are a legal entity separate and distinct from our direct and indirect subsidiaries. Our revenue (on a parent-only basis) is derived primarily from interest and dividends paid to us by the Bank. Our right, and consequently the right of our shareholders, to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of the Bank through the payment of such dividends or otherwise is necessarily subject to the prior claims of creditors of the Bank (including depositors), except to the extent that certain claims of us in a creditor capacity may be recognized.\nHolders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends only when, and if declared by our Board of Directors. Although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so and our Board of Directors may reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future. The FRB has authority to prohibit bank holding companies from paying dividends if such payment is deemed to be an unsafe or unsound practice. Additionally, the OCC has the authority to use its enforcement powers to prohibit a bank from paying dividends if, in its opinion, the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. Further, our ability to pay dividends would be restricted under current\nregulatory capital rules if we do not maintain a capital conservation buffer. A reduction or elimination of dividends could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. See Item 1. \u201cBusiness-Supervision and Regulation-Dividend Restrictions\u201d and \u201cBusiness-Supervision and Regulation-Regulatory Capital Requirements.\u201d\nReforms to London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") and other indices, and related uncertainty, may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that after 2021 it will no longer persuade or require banks to submit rates for LIBOR. This announcement, and, more generally, financial benchmark reforms and changes in the interbank lending markets, have resulted in uncertainty about the future of LIBOR and certain other rates or indices that are used as interest rate benchmarks. These actions may result in future changes in the rules or methodologies used to calculate benchmarks or in the discontinuance or unavailability of certain benchmarks. The possible impact of these actions is uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time, and the potential or actual discontinuance of benchmark quotes may have a material, adverse effect on the value of, return on and trading market for our financial assets and liabilities that are based on or are linked to benchmarks, including our hedge contracts, or our financial condition or results of operations. In addition, we cannot assure that we and other market participants will adequately be prepared for a discontinuation of LIBOR or other benchmarks, and such discontinuation may have an unpredictable impact on our contracts and/or cause significant disruption to financial markets that are relevant to our business, which may have a material, adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Arising From the Legal and Regulatory Framework in which Our Business Operates\nOur banking business is highly regulated, and we may be adversely affected by changes in law and regulation.\nWe are subject to regulation and supervision by the FRB, and the Bank is subject to regulation and supervision by the OCC and the FDIC, as well as regulations issued by the CFPB. Federal laws and regulations govern numerous matters affecting us, including changes in the ownership or control of banks and bank holding companies, maintenance of adequate capital and the financial condition of a financial institution, permissible types, amounts and terms of extensions of credit and investments, permissible nonbanking activities, the level of reserves against deposits and restrictions on dividend payments. The OCC possesses the power to issue cease and desist orders to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of law by banks subject to their regulation, and the FRB possesses similar powers with respect to bank holding companies. These and other restrictions limit the manner in which we may conduct business and obtain financing.\nOur business is highly regulated and the laws, rules, regulations, and supervisory guidance and policies applicable to us are subject to regular modification and change, and there have been significant revisions to the laws and regulations applicable to banks and bank holding companies that have been enacted or proposed in recent years. Changes to statutes, regulations, or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations, or policies, have and could in the future subject us to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products we may offer, and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things. Failure to comply with laws, regulations, policies or supervisory guidance could result in enforcement and other legal actions by federal or state authorities, including criminal and civil penalties, the loss of FDIC insurance, revocation of a banking charter, other sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties, and/or reputational damage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. See Item 1. \u201cBusiness-Supervision and Regulation.\u201d\nWe are required to maintain sufficient capital and adequate liquidity.\nAs a banking organization, our capital and liquidity are subject to regulation and supervision by banking regulators. We are required to maintain minimum levels of capital. In addition, our banking regulators could require us to maintain more and higher quality capital than previously expected. Our banking regulators could also require us to hold higher levels of short-term investments, thereby limiting our ability to invest in longer-term or less liquid assets at higher yields. The need to maintain capital and liquidity could result in our being required to take steps to increase our regulatory capital and may dilute shareholder value or limit our ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to our investors through stock repurchases. In addition, if we fail to maintain appropriate levels of capital or liquidity, we could become subject to formal or informal enforcement actions that may impose restrictions on our business, including limiting our lending activities or our ability to expand, requiring us to raise additional capital (which may be dilutive to shareholders) or requiring regulatory approval to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders. See Item 1. \u201cBusiness-Supervision and Regulation-Regulatory Capital Requirements\u201d for additional information on capital requirements applicable to us and the Bank.\nChanges in accounting standards can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. From time to time, the FASB and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes can be hard to anticipate and implement and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. For example, we implemented FASB\u2019s guidance on the measurement of credit losses (ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments), commonly known as \u201cCECL,\u201d effective as of January 1, 2020. CECL introduces a forward-looking \u201cexpected loss\u201d model to estimate credit losses, rather than the \u201cincurred loss\u201d model previously required under GAAP. CECL substantially changes how we calculate our allowance for credit losses. See Note 1 to our financial statements, Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Changes and Item 7. \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies\" for additional information on CECL and its impact on our financial reporting. Other future changes in accounting standards could materially impact how we report our financial condition, and we cannot predict whether such standards will be adopted or their resultant impact.\nChanges in tax laws and regulations and differences in interpretation of tax laws and regulations may adversely impact our financial statements.\nLocal, state or federal tax authorities may interpret tax laws and regulations differently than we do and challenge tax positions that we have taken on tax returns. This may result in differences in the treatment of revenues, deductions, credits and/or differences in the timing of these items. The differences in treatment may result in payment of additional taxes, interest or penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our results. In addition, there may be future changes to tax laws, administrative rulings or court decisions that could adversely affect our financial condition, including an increased provision for income taxes and/or reduced net income. We are not able to predict the timing or impact of any changes in local, state or federal tax laws.", "PERMNO": 85418, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "CAC"}
